A.; Zaidi, N.; Mishra, S.; Dalal, A.; Mohapatra, S.; Yadav, M.; Itoh, Y.; Leurs, R.; Chevigne, A.; Banerjee, R.; Shihoya, W.; Nureki, O.; SHUKLA, A. K.\nScore: 26.3, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578380\nSelectivity of natural agonists for their cognate receptors is one of the hallmarks of the members of GPCR family, and it is crucial for the specificity of downstream signal-transduction. However, this selectivity often breaks down in the chemokine receptor subfamily, wherein a high degree of promiscuity is observed with one receptor recognizing multiple chemokines and one chemokine binding to multiple receptors. The molecular determinants of such a striking promiscuity for natural ligands in the chemokine-chemokine receptor system remain mostly elusive and represent an important knowledge gap in our current understanding. Here, we carry out a comprehensive transducer-coupling analysis, testing all known C-X-C chemokines on every C-X-C type chemokine receptor, to generate a global fingerprint of the selectivity and promiscuity encoded within this system. Taking lead from our finding, we determined cryo-EM structures of the most promiscuous receptor, CXCR2, in complex with every interacting chemokine, and deciphered the conserved molecular signatures and distinct binding modalities. While most chemokines position themselves on the receptor as a dimer, CXCL6 exhibits a monomeric binding pose induced by a previously unanticipated reorientation of its carboxyl-terminal -helix, leading to disruption of the dimer interface. Surprisingly, one of the chemokines, CXCL5, induces a ligand-swapped dimer of CXCR2, the first of its kind observed in class A GPCRs, wherein each protomer of the ligand engages its own receptor without any discernible receptor-receptor interface. These unique observations provide a possible structural mechanism for inherent functional specialization encoded in chemokines despite their convergence to a common receptor. Furthermore, we also determined cryo-EM structures of CXCR3 in complex with G-protein-biased and {beta}-arrestin-biased small molecule agonists that elucidate distinct allosteric modulations in the receptor driving their divergent transducer-coupling bias. Guided by structural analysis and experimental validation, we discover that in contrast to previously held notion, small molecule agonists of CXCR3 display robust agonism at CXCR7, an intrinsically biased, {beta}-arrestin-coupled receptor, making them first-in-class dual agonists for chemokine receptors with exclusive {beta}arr-bias at CXCR7. Taken together, our study provides molecular insights into ligand promiscuity and signaling bias at the chemokine receptors, and also demonstrates a proof of principle that naturally encoded structural mimicry can be recapitulated using synthetic pharmacophores with potential implications for developing novel therapeutics.\nChallenging the Astral mass analyzer - going beyond 5200 proteins per single-cell at unseen quantitative accuracy to study cellular heterogeneity.\nAuthors: Bubis, J.

C.; Mechtler, K.; Matzinger, M.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578358\nA detailed proteome map is crucial for understanding molecular pathways and protein functions. Despite significant advancements in sample preparation, instrumentation, and data analysis, single-cell proteomics is currently limited by proteomic depth and quantitative performance. We combine a zero dead-end volume chromatographic column running at high throughput with the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer running in DIA mode. We yield unprecedented depth of proteome coverage as well as accuracy and precision for quantification of ultra-low input amounts. Using a tailored library, we identify up to 7400 protein groups from as little as 250 pg HeLa at a throughput of 50 samples per day (SPD). We benchmark multiple data analysis strategies, estimate their influence on FDR and show that FDR on protein level can easily be maintained at 1 %. Using a two-proteome mix, we check for optimal parameters of quantification and show that fold change differences of 2 can still be successfully determined at single-cell level inputs. Eventually, we apply our workflow to A549 cells yielding a proteome coverage of up to 5200 protein groups from a single cell, which allows the observation of heterogeneity in a cellular population and studying dependencies between cell size and cell-cycle phase. Additionally, our workflow enables us to distinguish between in vitro analogs of two human blastocyst lineages: naive human pluripotent stem cells (epiblast) and trophectoderm (TE)-like cells. Gene Ontology analysis of enriched proteins in TE-like cells harmoniously aligns with transcriptomic data, indicating that single-cell proteomics possesses the capability to identify biologically relevant differences between these two lineages within the blastocyst.\nLarge-scale characterization of drug mechanism of action using proteome-wide thermal shift assays\nAuthors: Van Vranken, J. G.; Li, J.; Mintseris, J.; Gadzuk-Shea, M.; Gygi, S. P.; Schweppe, D.\nScore: 40.4, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577428\nIn response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to characterize compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified 1.498 million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.\nConformational plasticity of a BiP-GRP94 chaperone complex\nAuthors: Brenner, J.

C.; Almeida-Hernandez, Y.; Kaschani, F.; Kaiser, M.; Sanchez-Garcia, E.; Poepsel, S.; Hellerschmied, D.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578445\nHsp70/Hsp90-chaperones and their regulatory co-chaperones are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis. GRP94, the sole Hsp90-chaperone in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells, is essential for the maturation of important secretory and transmembrane proteins. Without the requirement of co-chaperones, the Hsp70-protein BiP controls regulatory conformational changes of GRP94 - the structural basis of which has remained elusive. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize the formation of a BiP-GRP94 chaperone complex and its transition to a conformation expected to support the loading of substrate proteins from BiP onto GRP94. BiP initially binds to the open GRP94 dimer via an interaction interface that is conserved among Hsp70/90 paralogs. Subsequently, binding of a second BiP protein stabilizes a semi-closed GRP94 dimer, thereby advancing the chaperone cycle. Our findings highlight a fundamental mechanism of direct Hsp70/90 cooperation, independent of co-chaperones.\nRapid QC-MS - Interactive Dashboard for Synchronous Mass Spectrometry Data Acquisition Quality Control\nAuthors: Sandhu, W.; Gray, I. J.; Lin, S.; Elias, J. E.; DeFelice, B. C.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578059\nConsistently collecting high-quality liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is a time-consuming hurdle for untargeted workflows. Analytical controls such as internal and biological standards are commonly included in high throughput workflows, helping researchers recognize low integrity specimens regardless of their biological source. However, evaluating these standards as data are collected has remained a considerable bottleneck - in both person-hours and accuracy. Here we present Rapid QC-MS, an automated, interactive dashboard for assessing LC-MS/MS data quality. Minutes after a new data file is written, a browser-viewable dashboard is updated with quality control results spanning multiple performance dimensions such as instrument sensitivity, in-run retention time shifts, and mass accuracy drift. Rapid QC-MS provides interactive visualizations that help users recognize acute deviations in these performance metrics, as well as gradual drifts over periods of hours, days, months, or years. Rapid QC-MS is open-source, simple to install, and highly configurable. By integrating open-source python libraries and widely used MS analysis software, it can adapt to any LC-MS/MS workflow. Rapid QC-MS runs locally and offers optional remote quality control by syncing with Google Drive. Furthermore, Rapid QC-MS can operate in a semi-autonomous fashion, alerting users to specimens with potentially poor analytical integrity via frequently used messaging applications. Rapid QC-MS offers a fast, straightforward approach to help users collect high-quality untargeted LC-MS/MS data by eliminating many of the most time-consuming steps in manual data curation.

M.; Parey, K.; Walter, S.; Teis, D.; Januliene, D.; Schmidt, O.; Moeller, A.; Fröhlich, F.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577963\nThe levels of sphingolipids are crucial determinants of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, sphingolipid levels have to be tightly regulated. The Orm protein family and ceramides act as inhibitors in the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid biosynthesis - the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. The two yeast isoforms Orm1 and Orm2 form a complex with the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). While the sequences of the Orm proteins are highly similar, however, Orm1 and Orm2 are differentially regulated in yeast cells. The mechanistic details of the differential regulation remain elusive. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SPT complex containing Orm2. Through in vitro activity assays and a newly developed plasmid coverage assay combined with targeted lipidomics, we demonstrate that the SPT complex with Orm2 exhibits lower activity in comparison to the complex containing Orm1. This collectively suggests a higher inhibitory potential of Orm2, despite the remarkably similar structures of the Orm1- and Orm2 containing complexes. The high conservation of the SPT from yeast to man implies that the three human ORMDL isoforms could also have different regulatory capacities, which might be essential to understanding their role in sphingolipid-mediated neurodegenerative disorders.

H.; Makukhin, N.; Hay, R. T.; Ciulli, A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578957\nSmall molecule degraders of disease-driving proteins offer a clinically proven modality with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and the potential to tackle previously undrugged targets. Thermodynamically stable and kinetically long-lived degrader-mediated ternary complexes can drive faster, more profound and durable target degradation, however the mechanistic features by which they impact on target ubiquitination remain elusive. Here, we solve cryo-EM structures of the VHL Cullin 2 RING E3 ligase complexed with degrader MZ1, target protein Brd4BD2 and primed for catalysis with its cognate E2-ubiquitin bound. We find that Brd4BD2 adopts a favourable orientation towards the E2 active site. In vitro ubiquitination coupled with mass spectrometry illuminates a patch of ubiquitinable lysines on one face of Brd4BD2, with Lys456 showing optimal distance and geometry for nucleophilic attack. Our results demonstrate the proficiency of MZ1 in directing the substrate towards catalysis, explains the favourability of Brd4BD2 for ubiquitination, and reveals the flexibility of the enzyme in capturing sub-optimal lysines. We propose a model for ubiquitinability of degrader-recruited targets that provides a mechanistic blueprint for further rational drug design and optimization.\nLate consolidation of rRNA structure during co-transcriptional assembly in E. coli by time-resolved DMS footprinting\nAuthors: Hao, Y.; Hulscher, R. M.; Zinshteyn, B.; Woodson, S.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574868\nThe production of new ribosomes requires proper folding of the rRNA and the addition of more than 50 ribosomal proteins. The structures of some assembly intermediates have been determined by cryo-electron microscopy, yet these structures do not provide information on the folding dynamics of the rRNA. To visualize the changes in rRNA structure during ribosome assembly in E. coli cells, transcripts were pulse-labeled with 4-thiouridine and the structure of newly made rRNA probed at various times by dimethyl sulfate modification and mutational profiling sequencing (4U-DMS-MaPseq). The in-cell DMS modification patterns revealed that many long-range rRNA tertiary interactions and protein binding sites through the 16S and 23S rRNA remain partially unfolded 1.5 min after transcription. By contrast, the active sites were continually shielded from DMS modification, suggesting that these critical regions are guarded by cellular factors throughout assembly. Later, bases near the peptidyl tRNA site exhibited specific rearrangements consistent with the binding and release of assembly factors. Time-dependent structure-probing in cells suggests that many tertiary interactions throughout the new ribosomal subunits remain mobile or unfolded until the late stages of subunit maturation.\nConstraints on the Emergence of RNA through Non-Templated Primer Extension with Mixtures of Potentially Prebiotic Nucleotides\nAuthors: Jia, X.; Zhang, S. J.; Zhou, L.; Szostak, J. W.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576316\nThe emergence of RNA on the early Earth is likely to have been influenced by a series of chemical and physical processes that acted to filter out various alternative nucleic acids. For example, UV photostability is thought to have favored the survival of the canonical nucleotides. In a recent proposal for the prebiotic synthesis of the building blocks of RNA, ribonucleotides share a common pathway with arabino- and threo-nucleotides. We have therefore investigated non-templated primer extension with 2-aminoimidazole-activated forms of these alternative nucleotides to see if the synthesis of the first oligonucleotides might have been biased in favor of RNA. We show that non-templated primer extension occurs predominantly through 5'-5' imidazolium bridged dinucleotides, echoing the mechanism of template-directed primer extension. Ribo- and arabino-nucleotides exhibited comparable rates and yields of non-templated primer extension, whereas threo-nucleotides showed lower reactivity. Competition experiments with mixtures of nucleotides confirmed the bias against the incorporation of threo-nucleotides into oligonucleotides. This bias, coupled with selective prebiotic synthesis and templated copying favoring ribonucleotides, provides a plausible model for the exclusion of threo-nucleotides from primordial oligonucleotides. In contrast, the exclusion of arabino-nucleotides may have resulted primarily from biases in synthesis and in template-directed primer extension.\nHighly specific intracellular ubiquitination of a small molecule\nAuthors: Li, W.; Garcia-Rivera, E.

L.\nScore: 75.3, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577493\nUbiquitin is a small, highly conserved protein that acts as a posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination of proteins frequently serves as a degradation signal, marking them for disposal by the proteasome. Here, we report a novel small molecule from a diversity-oriented synthesis library, BRD1732, that is directly ubiquitinated in cells, resulting in dramatic accumulation of inactive ubiquitin monomers and polyubiquitin chains causing broad inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of BRD1732 and its associated cytotoxicity are stereospecific and dependent upon two homologous E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF19A and RNF19B. Our finding opens the possibility for indirect ubiquitination of a target through a ubiquitinated bifunctional small molecule, and more broadly raises the potential for posttranslational modification in trans.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Selectivity of natural agonists for their cognate receptors is one of the hallmarks of the members of GPCR family, and it is crucial for the specificity of downstream signal-transduction. However, this selectivity often breaks down in the chemokine receptor subfamily, wherein a high degree of promiscuity is observed with one receptor recognizing multiple chemokines and one chemokine binding to multiple receptors. The molecular determinants of such a striking promiscuity for natural ligands in the chemokine-chemokine receptor system remain mostly elusive and represent an important knowledge gap in our current understanding. Here, we carry out a comprehensive transducer-coupling analysis, testing all known C-X-C chemokines on every C-X-C type chemokine receptor, to generate a global fingerprint of the selectivity and promiscuity encoded within this system. Taking lead from our finding, we determined cryo-EM structures of the most promiscuous receptor, CXCR2, in complex with every interacting chemokine, and deciphered the conserved molecular signatures and distinct binding modalities. While most chemokines position themselves on the receptor as a dimer, CXCL6 exhibits a monomeric binding pose induced by a previously unanticipated reorientation of its carboxyl-terminal -helix, leading to disruption of the dimer interface. Surprisingly, one of the chemokines, CXCL5, induces a ligand-swapped dimer of CXCR2, the first of its kind observed in class A GPCRs, wherein each protomer of the ligand engages its own receptor without any discernible receptor-receptor interface. These unique observations provide a possible structural mechanism for inherent functional specialization encoded in chemokines despite their convergence to a common receptor. Furthermore, we also determined cryo-EM structures of CXCR3 in complex with G-protein-biased and {beta}-arrestin-biased small molecule agonists that elucidate distinct allosteric modulations in the receptor driving their divergent transducer-coupling bias. Guided by structural analysis and experimental validation, we discover that in contrast to previously held notion, small molecule agonists of CXCR3 display robust agonism at CXCR7, an intrinsically biased, {beta}-arrestin-coupled receptor, making them first-in-class dual agonists for chemokine receptors with exclusive {beta}arr-bias at CXCR7. Taken together, our study provides molecular insights into ligand promiscuity and signaling bias at the chemokine receptors, and also demonstrates a proof of principle that naturally encoded structural mimicry can be recapitulated using synthetic pharmacophores with potential implications for developing novel therapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A detailed proteome map is crucial for understanding molecular pathways and protein functions. Despite significant advancements in sample preparation, instrumentation, and data analysis, single-cell proteomics is currently limited by proteomic depth and quantitative performance. We combine a zero dead-end volume chromatographic column running at high throughput with the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer running in DIA mode. We yield unprecedented depth of proteome coverage as well as accuracy and precision for quantification of ultra-low input amounts. Using a tailored library, we identify up to 7400 protein groups from as little as 250 pg HeLa at a throughput of 50 samples per day (SPD). We benchmark multiple data analysis strategies, estimate their influence on FDR and show that FDR on protein level can easily be maintained at 1 %. Using a two-proteome mix, we check for optimal parameters of quantification and show that fold change differences of 2 can still be successfully determined at single-cell level inputs. Eventually, we apply our workflow to A549 cells yielding a proteome coverage of up to 5200 protein groups from a single cell, which allows the observation of heterogeneity in a cellular population and studying dependencies between cell size and cell-cycle phase. Additionally, our workflow enables us to distinguish between in vitro analogs of two human blastocyst lineages: naive human pluripotent stem cells (epiblast) and trophectoderm (TE)-like cells. Gene Ontology analysis of enriched proteins in TE-like cells harmoniously aligns with transcriptomic data, indicating that single-cell proteomics possesses the capability to identify biologically relevant differences between these two lineages within the blastocyst.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to characterize compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified 1.498 million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hsp70/Hsp90-chaperones and their regulatory co-chaperones are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis. GRP94, the sole Hsp90-chaperone in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells, is essential for the maturation of important secretory and transmembrane proteins. Without the requirement of co-chaperones, the Hsp70-protein BiP controls regulatory conformational changes of GRP94 - the structural basis of which has remained elusive. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize the formation of a BiP-GRP94 chaperone complex and its transition to a conformation expected to support the loading of substrate proteins from BiP onto GRP94. BiP initially binds to the open GRP94 dimer via an interaction interface that is conserved among Hsp70/90 paralogs. Subsequently, binding of a second BiP protein stabilizes a semi-closed GRP94 dimer, thereby advancing the chaperone cycle. Our findings highlight a fundamental mechanism of direct Hsp70/90 cooperation, independent of co-chaperones.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Consistently collecting high-quality liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is a time-consuming hurdle for untargeted workflows. Analytical controls such as internal and biological standards are commonly included in high throughput workflows, helping researchers recognize low integrity specimens regardless of their biological source. However, evaluating these standards as data are collected has remained a considerable bottleneck - in both person-hours and accuracy. Here we present Rapid QC-MS, an automated, interactive dashboard for assessing LC-MS/MS data quality. Minutes after a new data file is written, a browser-viewable dashboard is updated with quality control results spanning multiple performance dimensions such as instrument sensitivity, in-run retention time shifts, and mass accuracy drift. Rapid QC-MS provides interactive visualizations that help users recognize acute deviations in these performance metrics, as well as gradual drifts over periods of hours, days, months, or years. Rapid QC-MS is open-source, simple to install, and highly configurable. By integrating open-source python libraries and widely used MS analysis software, it can adapt to any LC-MS/MS workflow. Rapid QC-MS runs locally and offers optional remote quality control by syncing with Google Drive. Furthermore, Rapid QC-MS can operate in a semi-autonomous fashion, alerting users to specimens with potentially poor analytical integrity via frequently used messaging applications. Rapid QC-MS offers a fast, straightforward approach to help users collect high-quality untargeted LC-MS/MS data by eliminating many of the most time-consuming steps in manual data curation.

        <p class="abstract">The levels of sphingolipids are crucial determinants of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, sphingolipid levels have to be tightly regulated. The Orm protein family and ceramides act as inhibitors in the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid biosynthesis - the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. The two yeast isoforms Orm1 and Orm2 form a complex with the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). While the sequences of the Orm proteins are highly similar, however, Orm1 and Orm2 are differentially regulated in yeast cells. The mechanistic details of the differential regulation remain elusive. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SPT complex containing Orm2. Through in vitro activity assays and a newly developed plasmid coverage assay combined with targeted lipidomics, we demonstrate that the SPT complex with Orm2 exhibits lower activity in comparison to the complex containing Orm1. This collectively suggests a higher inhibitory potential of Orm2, despite the remarkably similar structures of the Orm1- and Orm2 containing complexes. The high conservation of the SPT from yeast to man implies that the three human ORMDL isoforms could also have different regulatory capacities, which might be essential to understanding their role in sphingolipid-mediated neurodegenerative disorders.

        <p class="abstract">Small molecule degraders of disease-driving proteins offer a clinically proven modality with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and the potential to tackle previously undrugged targets. Thermodynamically stable and kinetically long-lived degrader-mediated ternary complexes can drive faster, more profound and durable target degradation, however the mechanistic features by which they impact on target ubiquitination remain elusive. Here, we solve cryo-EM structures of the VHL Cullin 2 RING E3 ligase complexed with degrader MZ1, target protein Brd4BD2 and primed for catalysis with its cognate E2-ubiquitin bound. We find that Brd4BD2 adopts a favourable orientation towards the E2 active site. In vitro ubiquitination coupled with mass spectrometry illuminates a patch of ubiquitinable lysines on one face of Brd4BD2, with Lys456 showing optimal distance and geometry for nucleophilic attack. Our results demonstrate the proficiency of MZ1 in directing the substrate towards catalysis, explains the favourability of Brd4BD2 for ubiquitination, and reveals the flexibility of the enzyme in capturing sub-optimal lysines. We propose a model for ubiquitinability of degrader-recruited targets that provides a mechanistic blueprint for further rational drug design and optimization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The production of new ribosomes requires proper folding of the rRNA and the addition of more than 50 ribosomal proteins. The structures of some assembly intermediates have been determined by cryo-electron microscopy, yet these structures do not provide information on the folding dynamics of the rRNA. To visualize the changes in rRNA structure during ribosome assembly in E. coli cells, transcripts were pulse-labeled with 4-thiouridine and the structure of newly made rRNA probed at various times by dimethyl sulfate modification and mutational profiling sequencing (4U-DMS-MaPseq). The in-cell DMS modification patterns revealed that many long-range rRNA tertiary interactions and protein binding sites through the 16S and 23S rRNA remain partially unfolded 1.5 min after transcription. By contrast, the active sites were continually shielded from DMS modification, suggesting that these critical regions are guarded by cellular factors throughout assembly. Later, bases near the peptidyl tRNA site exhibited specific rearrangements consistent with the binding and release of assembly factors. Time-dependent structure-probing in cells suggests that many tertiary interactions throughout the new ribosomal subunits remain mobile or unfolded until the late stages of subunit maturation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The emergence of RNA on the early Earth is likely to have been influenced by a series of chemical and physical processes that acted to filter out various alternative nucleic acids. For example, UV photostability is thought to have favored the survival of the canonical nucleotides. In a recent proposal for the prebiotic synthesis of the building blocks of RNA, ribonucleotides share a common pathway with arabino- and threo-nucleotides. We have therefore investigated non-templated primer extension with 2-aminoimidazole-activated forms of these alternative nucleotides to see if the synthesis of the first oligonucleotides might have been biased in favor of RNA. We show that non-templated primer extension occurs predominantly through 5&#39;-5&#39; imidazolium bridged dinucleotides, echoing the mechanism of template-directed primer extension. Ribo- and arabino-nucleotides exhibited comparable rates and yields of non-templated primer extension, whereas threo-nucleotides showed lower reactivity. Competition experiments with mixtures of nucleotides confirmed the bias against the incorporation of threo-nucleotides into oligonucleotides. This bias, coupled with selective prebiotic synthesis and templated copying favoring ribonucleotides, provides a plausible model for the exclusion of threo-nucleotides from primordial oligonucleotides. In contrast, the exclusion of arabino-nucleotides may have resulted primarily from biases in synthesis and in template-directed primer extension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved protein that acts as a posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination of proteins frequently serves as a degradation signal, marking them for disposal by the proteasome. Here, we report a novel small molecule from a diversity-oriented synthesis library, BRD1732, that is directly ubiquitinated in cells, resulting in dramatic accumulation of inactive ubiquitin monomers and polyubiquitin chains causing broad inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of BRD1732 and its associated cytotoxicity are stereospecific and dependent upon two homologous E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF19A and RNF19B. Our finding opens the possibility for indirect ubiquitination of a target through a ubiquitinated bifunctional small molecule, and more broadly raises the potential for posttranslational modification in trans.</p>
