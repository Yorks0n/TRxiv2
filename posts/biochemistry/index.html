R.; Morey-Burrows, F. S.; Anishchenko, I.; Humphreys, I. R.; McHugh, R.; Vafeados, D.; Li, X.; Sutherland, G. A.; Hitchcock, A.; Hunter, C. N.; Baek, M.; DiMaio, F.; Baker, D.\nScore: 338.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561603\nAlthough AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RoseTTAFold (RF) have transformed structural biology by enabling high-accuracy protein structure modeling, they are unable to model covalent modifications or interactions with small molecules and other non-protein molecules that can play key roles in biological function. Here, we describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), a deep network capable of modeling full biological assemblies containing proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications given the sequences of the polymers and the atomic bonded geometry of the small molecules and covalent modifications. Following training on structures of full biological assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), RFAA has comparable protein structure prediction accuracy to AF2, excellent performance in CAMEO for flexible backbone small molecule docking, and reasonable prediction accuracy for protein covalent modifications and assemblies of proteins with multiple nucleic acid chains and small molecules which, to our knowledge, no existing method can model simultaneously. By fine-tuning on diffusive denoising tasks, we develop RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which generates binding pockets by directly building protein structures around small molecules and other non-protein molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we design and experimentally validate proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and optically active bilin molecules with potential for expanding the range of wavelengths captured by photosynthesis. We anticipate that RFAA and RFdiffusionAA will be widely useful for modeling and designing complex biomolecular systems.\nDefining the Cell Surface Cysteinome using Two-step Enrichment Proteomics\nAuthors: Yan, T.; Boatner, L.; Cui, L.; Tontonoz, P.; Backus, K.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562832\nThe plasma membrane proteome is a rich resource of functional and therapeutically relevant protein targets. Distinguished by high hydrophobicity, heavy glycosylation, disulfide-rich sequences, and low overall abundance, the cell surface proteome remains undersampled in established proteomic pipelines, including our own cysteine chemoproteomics platforms. Here we paired cell surface glycoprotein capture with cysteine chemoproteomics to establish a two-stage enrichment method that enables chemoproteomic profiling of cell Surface Cysteinome. Our \"Cys-Surf\" platform captures \u003e2,800 total membrane protein cysteines in 1,046 proteins, including 1,907 residues not previously captured by bulk proteomic analysis. By pairing Cys-Surf with an isotopic chemoproteomic readout, we uncovered 821 total ligandable cysteines, including known and novel sites. Cys-Surf also robustly delineates redox-sensitive cysteines, including cysteines prone to activation-dependent changes to cysteine oxidation state and residues sensitive to addition of exogenous reductants. Exemplifying the capacity of Cys-Surf to delineate functionally important cysteines, we identified a redox sensitive cysteine in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) that impacts both the protein localization and uptake of LDL particles. Taken together, the Cys-Surf platform, distinguished by its two-stage enrichment paradigm, represents a tailored approach to delineate the functional and therapeutic potential of the plasma membrane cysteinome.\nCryo-EM structure of the CDK2-cyclin A-CDC25A complex\nAuthors: Rowland, R. J.; Korolchuk, S.; Salamina, M.; Ault, J. R.; Hart, S.; Turkenberg, J. P.; Blaza, J. N.; Noble, M. E.; Endicott, J. A.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562665\nThe cell division cycle 25 phosphatases CDC25A, B and C regulate cell cycle transitions by dephosphorylating residues in the conserved glycine-rich motif of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) to activate CDK activity. Here, we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CDK2-cyclin A in complex with CDC25A at 2.91 [A] resolution, providing a detailed structural analysis of the overall complex architecture and key protein-protein interactions that underpin this 86 kDa complex. We further reveal an unanticipated CDC25A C-terminal helix that is critical for complex formation. Sequence conservation analysis suggests CDK1/2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin B and CDK2/3-cyclin E are suitable binding partners for CDC25A, whilst CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes appear unlikely substrates. A comparative structural analysis of CDK-containing complexes also confirms the functional importance of the conserved CDK1/2 GDSEID motif. This structure improves our understanding of the roles of CDC25 phosphatases in CDK regulation and may inform the development of CDC25- targeting anticancer strategies.\nExploiting the Cullin E3 Ligase Adaptor Protein SKP1 for Targeted Protein Degradation\nAuthors: Hong, S. H.; Osa, A.; Wertz, I. E.; Nomura, D.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563371\nTargeted protein degradation with Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is a powerful therapeutic modality for eliminating disease-causing proteins through targeted ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Most PROTACs have exploited substrate receptors of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases such as cereblon and VHL. Whether core, shared, and essential components of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can be used for PROTAC applications remains less explored. Here, we discovered a cysteine-reactive covalent recruiter EN884 against the SKP1 adapter protein of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box containing SCF complex. We further showed that this recruiter can be used in PROTAC applications to degrade neo-substrate proteins such as BRD4 and the androgen receptor in a SKP1- and proteasome-dependent manner. Our studies demonstrate that core and essential adapter proteins within the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can be exploited for targeted protein degradation applications and that covalent chemoproteomic strategies can enable recruiter discovery against these targets.\nStructural and molecular basis of choline uptake into the brain by FLVCR2\nAuthors: Cater, R. J.; Mukherjee, D.; Gil Iturbe, E.; Erramilli, S. K.; Chen, T.; Koo, K.; Santander, N. G.; Reckers, A. R.; Kloss, B.; Gawda, T.; Choy, B. C.; Zhang, Z.; Clarke, O. B.; Yee, S. W.; Kossiakoff, A. K.; Quick, M.; Arnold, T.; Mancia, F.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561059\nCholine is an essential nutrient that the human body needs in vast quantities for cell membrane synthesis, epigenetic modification, and neurotransmission. The brain has a particularly high demand for choline, but how it enters the brain has eluded the field for over fifty years. The MFS transporter FLVCR1 was recently determined to be a choline transporter, and while this protein is not highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), its relative FLVCR2 is. Previous studies have shown that mutations in human Flvcr2 cause cerebral vascular abnormalities, hydrocephalus, and embryonic lethality, but the physiological role of FLVCR2 is unknown. Here, we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that FLVCR2 is a BBB choline transporter and is responsible for the majority of choline uptake into the brain. We also determine the structures of choline-bound FLVCR2 in the inward- and outward-facing states using cryo-electron microscopy to 2.49 and 2.77 [A] resolution, respectively. These results reveal how the brain obtains choline and provide molecular-level insights into how FLVCR2 binds choline in an aromatic cage and mediates its uptake. Our work could provide a novel framework for the targeted delivery of neurotherapeutics into the brain.\nHeterogeneity of Tethered Agonist Signaling in Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptors\nAuthors: Dates, A. N.; Jones, D. T. D.; Smith, J. S.; Skiba, M. A.; Rich, M. F.; Burruss, M. M.; Kruse, A. C.; Blacklow, S. C.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.14.500097\nAdhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor (aGPCR) signaling influences development and homeostasis in a wide range of tissues. In the current model for aGPCR signaling, ligand binding liberates or unmasks a highly conserved tethered agonist (TA) that acts as an intramolecular ligand to stimulate G protein coupling. However, a systematic, comprehensive examination of signaling has not been performed for all aGPCR family members. Here, we report a platform for profiling TA-dependent activities of aGPCRs in several different assays and apply it to all 33 human family members. Activity profiling identified a heterogeneity of responses among these aGPCRs, with only [~]50% showing robust, TA-dependent signals. AlphaFold2 predictions assessing TA engagement in the predicted intramolecular binding pocket aligned with the TA-dependence of the cellular responses. The signaling information in this dataset is a comprehensive resource relevant for the investigation of all human aGPCRs and for targeting aGPCRs therapeutically.\nThe guide RNA sequence dictates the slicing kinetics and conformational dynamics of the Argonaute silencing complex\nAuthors: Wang, P. Y.; Bartel, D. P.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562437\nThe RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which powers RNA interference (RNAi), consists of a guide RNA and an Argonaute protein that slices target RNAs complementary to the guide. We find that for different guide-RNA sequences, slicing rates of perfectly paired, bound targets can be surprisingly different (\u003e250-fold range), and that faster slicing confers greater knockdown efficacy in cells. Four sequence determinants underlie much of this variation in slicing rates. Analyses of these determinants implicate a structural distortion at guide nucleotides 6-7 in promoting slicing, and indicate that, in contrast to the prevailing model, slicing is primarily limited by the rate at which the enzyme-substrate complex reaches a slicing-competent conformation. Moreover, different guide sequences have an unanticipated, 600-fold range in 3'-mismatch tolerance, which is attributable to the GC-content of their central regions. Together, our analyses identify sequence determinants of RISC activity and provide biochemical, conformational, and functional rationale for their action.\nAddressing the dNTP bottleneck restricting prime editing activity\nAuthors: Ponnienselvan, K.; Liu, P.; Nyalile, T.; Oikemus, S.; Joynt, A. T.; Kelly, K.; Guo, D.; Chen, Z.; Lee, J. M.; Schiffer, C. A.; Emerson, C. P.; Lawson, N. D.; Watts, J. K.; Sontheimer, E. J.; Luban, J. J.; Wolfe, S. A.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563443\nPrime editing efficiency is modest in cells that are quiescent or slowly proliferating where intracellular dNTP levels are tightly regulated. MMLV-reverse transcriptase - the prime editor polymerase subunit - requires high intracellular dNTPs levels for efficient polymerization. We report that prime editing efficiency in primary cells and in vivo is increased by mutations that enhance the enzymatic properties of MMLV-reverse transcriptase and can be further complemented by targeting SAMHD1 for degradation.\nComparison of alternative solvents for in situ extraction of hydrocarbons from the colonial green alga Botryococcus braunii race B (Showa)\nAuthors: Ozawa-Uyeda, T. A.; Overmans, S. J.; Bastos de Freitas, B.; Lozoya-Gloria, E.; Lauersen, K. J.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563540\nBackground: The colony-forming, green microalga Botryococcus braunii secretes large amounts of petroleum-like hydrocarbons, which enables non-destructive in situ extraction (milking) of these extracellular hydrocarbons during culture growth continuously without cell lysis. This study compares the suitability of 15 different solvents, including alkanes, halogens, and green solvents, for in situ extraction of B. braunii race B (Showa strain) hydrocarbons after acclimation to moderate salinity stress. Findings: After 24 h of extraction, bio-based terpene 'green' solvents such as gamma-terpinene showed the highest hydrocarbon extraction capacity, with GC peak areas of botryococcenes around 10-fold greater than with conventional alkane solvents. Brominated alkanes and liquid perfluorocarbons (FCs) formed a lower phase to algal cultures rather than an upper phase as with other solvents, but only bromodecane effectively captured extracellular hydrocarbons as is the case with conventional alkane solvents. However, bromodecane and all green solvents were too toxic for two-phase continuous culture contact hydrocarbon milking, leading to 33-100% chlorophyll content loss in algal cultures. Conclusions: To overcome the adverse effects of these promising solvents, future research should focus on their application in short-term extraction period-milking systems to minimize algal-solvent contact and enable continuous extraction.\nEx vivo structures from spinach leaves\nAuthors: Wang, J.; Johansen, N. T.; Gamon, L. F.; Zhao, Z.; Guo, Z.; Wang, Y.; Fuglsang, A. T.; Gourdon, P.; Wang, K.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562012\nEx vivo structure determination of macromolecules from native source is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community, as the method can be employed to dissect the function of important, multi-component molecular machines. However, the existing ex vivo procedures often require genome manipulation or availability high-affinity binders, limiting the general applicability. Here, we report simple yet robust principles for isolation of protein complexes from enriched native biological material, enabling cryoEM-facilitated high-resolution structure determination. We report the structures of ten separate membrane and soluble protein complexes determined from spinach leaves. Moreover, the developed pipeline is likely adaptable to essentially any biological system. As such, the approach may represent an attractive avenue for future structural proteomics efforts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RoseTTAFold (RF) have transformed structural biology by enabling high-accuracy protein structure modeling, they are unable to model covalent modifications or interactions with small molecules and other non-protein molecules that can play key roles in biological function. Here, we describe RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), a deep network capable of modeling full biological assemblies containing proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, metals, and covalent modifications given the sequences of the polymers and the atomic bonded geometry of the small molecules and covalent modifications. Following training on structures of full biological assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), RFAA has comparable protein structure prediction accuracy to AF2, excellent performance in CAMEO for flexible backbone small molecule docking, and reasonable prediction accuracy for protein covalent modifications and assemblies of proteins with multiple nucleic acid chains and small molecules which, to our knowledge, no existing method can model simultaneously. By fine-tuning on diffusive denoising tasks, we develop RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which generates binding pockets by directly building protein structures around small molecules and other non-protein molecules. Starting from random distributions of amino acid residues surrounding target small molecules, we design and experimentally validate proteins that bind the cardiac disease therapeutic digoxigenin, the enzymatic cofactor heme, and optically active bilin molecules with potential for expanding the range of wavelengths captured by photosynthesis. We anticipate that RFAA and RFdiffusionAA will be widely useful for modeling and designing complex biomolecular systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The plasma membrane proteome is a rich resource of functional and therapeutically relevant protein targets. Distinguished by high hydrophobicity, heavy glycosylation, disulfide-rich sequences, and low overall abundance, the cell surface proteome remains undersampled in established proteomic pipelines, including our own cysteine chemoproteomics platforms. Here we paired cell surface glycoprotein capture with cysteine chemoproteomics to establish a two-stage enrichment method that enables chemoproteomic profiling of cell Surface Cysteinome. Our &#34;Cys-Surf&#34; platform captures &gt;2,800 total membrane protein cysteines in 1,046 proteins, including 1,907 residues not previously captured by bulk proteomic analysis. By pairing Cys-Surf with an isotopic chemoproteomic readout, we uncovered 821 total ligandable cysteines, including known and novel sites. Cys-Surf also robustly delineates redox-sensitive cysteines, including cysteines prone to activation-dependent changes to cysteine oxidation state and residues sensitive to addition of exogenous reductants. Exemplifying the capacity of Cys-Surf to delineate functionally important cysteines, we identified a redox sensitive cysteine in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) that impacts both the protein localization and uptake of LDL particles. Taken together, the Cys-Surf platform, distinguished by its two-stage enrichment paradigm, represents a tailored approach to delineate the functional and therapeutic potential of the plasma membrane cysteinome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cell division cycle 25 phosphatases CDC25A, B and C regulate cell cycle transitions by dephosphorylating residues in the conserved glycine-rich motif of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) to activate CDK activity. Here, we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CDK2-cyclin A in complex with CDC25A at 2.91 [A] resolution, providing a detailed structural analysis of the overall complex architecture and key protein-protein interactions that underpin this 86 kDa complex. We further reveal an unanticipated CDC25A C-terminal helix that is critical for complex formation. Sequence conservation analysis suggests CDK1/2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin B and CDK2/3-cyclin E are suitable binding partners for CDC25A, whilst CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes appear unlikely substrates. A comparative structural analysis of CDK-containing complexes also confirms the functional importance of the conserved CDK1/2 GDSEID motif. This structure improves our understanding of the roles of CDC25 phosphatases in CDK regulation and may inform the development of CDC25- targeting anticancer strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeted protein degradation with Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is a powerful therapeutic modality for eliminating disease-causing proteins through targeted ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Most PROTACs have exploited substrate receptors of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases such as cereblon and VHL. Whether core, shared, and essential components of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can be used for PROTAC applications remains less explored. Here, we discovered a cysteine-reactive covalent recruiter EN884 against the SKP1 adapter protein of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box containing SCF complex. We further showed that this recruiter can be used in PROTAC applications to degrade neo-substrate proteins such as BRD4 and the androgen receptor in a SKP1- and proteasome-dependent manner. Our studies demonstrate that core and essential adapter proteins within the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can be exploited for targeted protein degradation applications and that covalent chemoproteomic strategies can enable recruiter discovery against these targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Choline is an essential nutrient that the human body needs in vast quantities for cell membrane synthesis, epigenetic modification, and neurotransmission. The brain has a particularly high demand for choline, but how it enters the brain has eluded the field for over fifty years. The MFS transporter FLVCR1 was recently determined to be a choline transporter, and while this protein is not highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), its relative FLVCR2 is. Previous studies have shown that mutations in human Flvcr2 cause cerebral vascular abnormalities, hydrocephalus, and embryonic lethality, but the physiological role of FLVCR2 is unknown. Here, we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that FLVCR2 is a BBB choline transporter and is responsible for the majority of choline uptake into the brain. We also determine the structures of choline-bound FLVCR2 in the inward- and outward-facing states using cryo-electron microscopy to 2.49 and 2.77 [A] resolution, respectively. These results reveal how the brain obtains choline and provide molecular-level insights into how FLVCR2 binds choline in an aromatic cage and mediates its uptake. Our work could provide a novel framework for the targeted delivery of neurotherapeutics into the brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor (aGPCR) signaling influences development and homeostasis in a wide range of tissues. In the current model for aGPCR signaling, ligand binding liberates or unmasks a highly conserved tethered agonist (TA) that acts as an intramolecular ligand to stimulate G protein coupling. However, a systematic, comprehensive examination of signaling has not been performed for all aGPCR family members. Here, we report a platform for profiling TA-dependent activities of aGPCRs in several different assays and apply it to all 33 human family members. Activity profiling identified a heterogeneity of responses among these aGPCRs, with only [~]50% showing robust, TA-dependent signals. AlphaFold2 predictions assessing TA engagement in the predicted intramolecular binding pocket aligned with the TA-dependence of the cellular responses. The signaling information in this dataset is a comprehensive resource relevant for the investigation of all human aGPCRs and for targeting aGPCRs therapeutically.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which powers RNA interference (RNAi), consists of a guide RNA and an Argonaute protein that slices target RNAs complementary to the guide. We find that for different guide-RNA sequences, slicing rates of perfectly paired, bound targets can be surprisingly different (&gt;250-fold range), and that faster slicing confers greater knockdown efficacy in cells. Four sequence determinants underlie much of this variation in slicing rates. Analyses of these determinants implicate a structural distortion at guide nucleotides 6-7 in promoting slicing, and indicate that, in contrast to the prevailing model, slicing is primarily limited by the rate at which the enzyme-substrate complex reaches a slicing-competent conformation. Moreover, different guide sequences have an unanticipated, 600-fold range in 3&#39;-mismatch tolerance, which is attributable to the GC-content of their central regions. Together, our analyses identify sequence determinants of RISC activity and provide biochemical, conformational, and functional rationale for their action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prime editing efficiency is modest in cells that are quiescent or slowly proliferating where intracellular dNTP levels are tightly regulated. MMLV-reverse transcriptase - the prime editor polymerase subunit - requires high intracellular dNTPs levels for efficient polymerization.

        <p class="abstract">Background: The colony-forming, green microalga Botryococcus braunii secretes large amounts of petroleum-like hydrocarbons, which enables non-destructive in situ extraction (milking) of these extracellular hydrocarbons during culture growth continuously without cell lysis. This study compares the suitability of 15 different solvents, including alkanes, halogens, and green solvents, for in situ extraction of B. braunii race B (Showa strain) hydrocarbons after acclimation to moderate salinity stress. Findings: After 24 h of extraction, bio-based terpene &#39;green&#39; solvents such as gamma-terpinene showed the highest hydrocarbon extraction capacity, with GC peak areas of botryococcenes around 10-fold greater than with conventional alkane solvents. Brominated alkanes and liquid perfluorocarbons (FCs) formed a lower phase to algal cultures rather than an upper phase as with other solvents, but only bromodecane effectively captured extracellular hydrocarbons as is the case with conventional alkane solvents. However, bromodecane and all green solvents were too toxic for two-phase continuous culture contact hydrocarbon milking, leading to 33-100% chlorophyll content loss in algal cultures. Conclusions: To overcome the adverse effects of these promising solvents, future research should focus on their application in short-term extraction period-milking systems to minimize algal-solvent contact and enable continuous extraction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ex vivo structure determination of macromolecules from native source is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community, as the method can be employed to dissect the function of important, multi-component molecular machines. However, the existing ex vivo procedures often require genome manipulation or availability high-affinity binders, limiting the general applicability. Here, we report simple yet robust principles for isolation of protein complexes from enriched native biological material, enabling cryoEM-facilitated high-resolution structure determination. We report the structures of ten separate membrane and soluble protein complexes determined from spinach leaves. Moreover, the developed pipeline is likely adaptable to essentially any biological system. As such, the approach may represent an attractive avenue for future structural proteomics efforts.</p>
