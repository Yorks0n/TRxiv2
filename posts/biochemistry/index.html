A.; Gibson, C.; Wong, E.; Ieven, M.; Telenti, A.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574565\nThe human coronavirus HKU1 spike (S) glycoprotein engages host cell surface sialoglycans and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to initiate infection. The molecular basis of HKU1 binding to TMPRSS2 and determinants of host receptor tropism remain elusive. Here, we designed an active human TMPRSS2 construct enabling high-yield recombinant production in human cells of this key therapeutic target. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HKU1 RBD bound to human TMPRSS2 providing a blueprint of the interactions supporting viral entry and explaining the specificity for TMPRSS2 among human type 2 transmembrane serine proteases. We found that human, rat, hamster and camel TMPRSS2 promote HKU1 S-mediated entry into cells and identified key residues governing host receptor usage. Our data show that serum antibodies targeting the HKU1 RBD TMPRSS2 binding-site are key for neutralization and that HKU1 uses conformational masking and glycan shielding to balance immune evasion and receptor engagement.\nQuinone extraction drives atmospheric carbon monoxide oxidation in bacteria\nAuthors: Kropp, A.; Gillett, D. L.; Venugopal, H.; Gonzalvez, M. A.; Lingford, J. P.; Barlow, C. K.; Zhang, J.; Greening, C.; Grinter, R.\nScore: 31.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574806\nDiverse bacteria and archaea use atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) as an energy source during long-term survival. This process enhances the biodiversity of soil and marine ecosystems globally and removes 250 million tonnes of a toxic, climate-relevant pollutant from the atmosphere each year. Bacteria use [MoCu]-carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (Mo-CODH) to convert CO to carbon dioxide, then transfer the liberated high-energy electrons to the aerobic respiratory chain. However, given no high-affinity Mo-CODH has been purified, it is unknown how these enzymes oxidise CO at low concentrations and interact with the respiratory chain. Here we resolve these knowledge gaps by analysing Mo-CODH (CoxSML) and its hypothetical partner CoxG from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Kinetic and electrochemical analyses show purified Mo-CODH is a highly active high-affinity enzyme (Km = 139 nM, kcat = 54.2 s-1). Based on its 1.85 [A] resolution cryoEM structure, Mo-CODH forms a CoxSML homodimer similar to characterised low-affinity homologs, but has distinct active site coordination and narrower gas channels that may modulate affinity. We provide structural, biochemical, and genetic evidence that Mo-CODH transfers CO-derived electrons to the aerobic respiratory chain via the membrane-bound menaquinone-binding protein CoxG. Consistently, CoxG is required for CO-driven respiration, extracts menaquinone from mycobacterial membranes, and binds quinones in a hydrophobic pocket. Finally, we show that Mo-CODH and CoxG genetically and structurally associate in diverse bacteria and archaea. These findings reveal the basis of a biogeochemically and ecologically important process, while demonstrating that the newly discovered process of long-range quinone transport is a general mechanism of energy conservation, which convergently evolved on multiple occasions.\nIdentification of extracellular membrane protein ENPP3 as a major cGAMP hydrolase, cementing cGAMP's role as an immunotransmitter\nAuthors: Mardjuki, R.; Wang, S.; Carozza, J.; Abhiraman, G.; Lyu, X.; Li, L.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575449\ncGAMP is a second messenger that is synthesized in the cytosol upon detection of cytosolic dsDNA and passed between cells to facilitate downstream immune signaling. ENPP1, an extracellular enzyme, was the only metazoan cGAMP hydrolase known to regulate cGAMP levels to dampen anti-cancer immunity. Here, we uncover ENPP3 as the second and only other metazoan cGAMP hydrolase under homeostatic conditions. ENPP3 has a tissue expression pattern distinct from that of ENPP1 and accounts for all remaining cGAMP hydrolysis activity in mice lacking ENPP1. Importantly, we also show that as with ENPP1, selectively abolishing ENPP3's cGAMP hydrolase activity results in diminished cancer growth and metastasis of certain tumor types. Both ENPP1 and ENPP3 are extracellular enzymes, suggesting the dominant role that extracellular cGAMP must play as a mediator of cell-cell innate immune communication. Our work clearly shows that ENPP1 and ENPP3 non-redundantly dampen extracellular cGAMP-STING signaling, pointing to ENPP3 as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.\nACAD10 and ACAD11 enable mammalian 4-hydroxy acid lipid catabolism\nAuthors: Rashan, E. H.; Bartlett, A. K.; Khana, D. B.; Zhang, J.; Jain, R.; Smith, A. J.; Baker, Z. N.; Cook, T.; Caldwell, A.; Chevalier, A. R.; Pfleger, B. F.; Yuan, P.; Amador-Noguez, D.; Simcox, J. A.; Pagliarini, D. J.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574893\nFatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) is a central catabolic pathway with broad implications for organismal health. However, various fatty acids are largely incompatible with standard FAO machinery until they are modified by other enzymes. Included among these are the 4-hydroxy acids (4-HAs)--fatty acids hydroxylated at the 4 ({gamma}) position--which can be provided from dietary intake, lipid peroxidation, and certain drugs of abuse. Here, we reveal that two atypical and poorly characterized acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs), ACAD10 and ACAD11, drive 4-HA catabolism in mice. Unlike other ACADs, ACAD10 and ACAD11 feature kinase domains N-terminal to their ACAD domains that phosphorylate the 4-OH position as a requisite step in the conversion of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoAs into 2-enoyl-CoAs--conventional FAO intermediates. Our ACAD11 cryo-EM structure and molecular modeling reveal a unique binding pocket capable of accommodating this phosphorylated intermediate. We further show that ACAD10 is mitochondrial and necessary for catabolizing shorter-chain 4-HAs, whereas ACAD11 is peroxisomal and enables longer-chain 4-HA catabolism. Mice lacking ACAD11 accumulate 4-HAs in their plasma while comparable 3- and 5-hydroxy acids remain unchanged. Collectively, this work defines ACAD10 and ACAD11 as the primary gatekeepers of mammalian 4-HA catabolism and sets the stage for broader investigations into the ramifications of aberrant 4-HA metabolism in human health and disease.\nDefining a small-molecule stimulator of the human Hsp70-disaggregase system with selectivity for DnaJB proteins\nAuthors: Chuang, E.; Cupo, R. R.; Bevan, J. R.; Rice, M. L.; Mao, S.; Gorenberg, E. L.; Mack, K. L.; Huryn, D. M.; Wipf, P.; Brodsky, J. L.; Shorter, J.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575109\nHsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 form a human protein-disaggregase system that solubilizes and reactivates proteins trapped in aggregated states. However, this system fails to maintain proteostasis in fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we potentiate the human Hsp70-disaggregase system pharmacologically. By scouring a collection of dihydropyrimidines, we disambiguate a small molecule that specifically stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system against disordered aggregates and -synuclein fibrils. The newly identified lead compound stimulates the disaggregase activity of multiple active human Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp110 chaperone sets, with selectivity for combinations that include DnaJB1 or DnaJB4 as the Hsp40. We find that the relative stoichiometry of Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 dictates disaggregase activity. Remarkably, our lead compound shifts the composition of active chaperone stoichiometries by preferentially activating combinations with lower DnaJB1 concentrations. Our findings unveil a small molecule that stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system, even at suboptimal chaperone stoichiometries, which could be developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

M.; Park, Y.-J.; Asarnow, D.; Powers, J. M.; Treichel, C.; Corti, D.; Baric, R.; King, N. P.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 77.9, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571160\nContinuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 alters the antigenicity of the immunodominant spike (S) receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain, undermining the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. To overcome this challenge, we set out to develop a vaccine focusing antibody responses on the highly conserved but metastable S2 subunit, which folds as a spring-loaded fusion machinery. Here, we describe a protein design strategy enabling prefusion-stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit and high yield recombinant expression of trimers with native structure and antigenicity. We demonstrate that our design strategy is broadly generalizable to all sarbecoviruses, as exemplified with the SARS-CoV-1 (clade 1a) and PRD-0038 (clade 3) S2 fusion machineries. Immunization of mice with a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S2 trimer vaccine elicits broadly reactive sarbecovirus antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers of comparable magnitude against Wuhan-Hu-1 and the immune evasive XBB.1.5 variant. Vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss and disease upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5, providing proof-of-principle for fusion machinery sarbecovirus vaccines motivating future development.\nSubstrate recognition mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated ubiquitin ligase Doa10\nAuthors: Wu, K.; Itskanov, S.; Lynch, D. L.; Chen, Y.; Turner, A.; Gumbart, J.; Park, E.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574907\nDoa10 (MARCH6 in metazoans) is a large polytopic membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays an important role in quality control of cytosolic and ER proteins. Although Doa10 is highly conserved across eukaryotes, it is not understood how Doa10 recognizes its substrates. Here, we defined the substrate recognition mechanism of Doa10 by structural and functional analyses on Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doa10 and its well-defined degron Deg1. Cryo-EM analysis shows that Doa10 has unusual architecture with a large lipid-filled central cavity, and its conserved middle domain forms an additional water-filled lateral tunnel open to the cytosol. Our biochemical data and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the entrance of the substrates degron peptide into the lateral tunnel is required for efficient polyubiquitination. The N- and C-terminal membrane domains of Doa10 seem to form fence-like features to restrict polyubiquitination to those proteins that can access the central cavity and lateral tunnel.\nStructure of an open KATP channel reveals tandem PIP2 binding sites mediating the Kir6.2 and SUR1 regulatory interface\nAuthors: Driggers, C. M.; Kuo, Y.-Y.; Zhu, P.; ElSheikh, A.; Shyng, S.-L.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551546\nATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of four pore-lining Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits, control insulin secretion in pancreatic {beta}-cells. KATP channel opening is stimulated by PIP2 and inhibited by ATP. Mutations that increase channel opening by PIP2 reduce ATP inhibition and cause neonatal diabetes. Although considerable evidence has implicated a role for PIP2 in KATP channel function, previously solved open-channel structures have lacked bound PIP2, and mechanisms by which PIP2 regulates KATP channels remain unresolved. Here, we report cryoEM structure of a KATP channel harboring the neonatal diabetes mutation Kir6.2-Q52R, bound to natural C18:0/C20:4 long-chain PI(4,5)P2 in open conformation. The structure reveals two adjacent PIP2 molecules between SUR1 and Kir6.2. The first PIP2 binding site is conserved among PIP2-gated Kir channels. The second site forms uniquely in KATP at the interface of Kir6.2 and SUR1. Functional studies demonstrate both binding sites determine channel activity. Kir6.2 pore opening is associated with a twist of the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain and a rotation of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1, which widens the inhibitory ATP binding pocket to disfavor ATP binding. The open conformation is particularly stabilized by the Kir6.2-Q52R residue through cation-{pi} bonding with SUR1 - W51. Together, these results uncover the cooperation between SUR1 and Kir6.2 in PIP2 binding and gating, explain the antagonistic regulation of KATP channels by PIP2 and ATP, and provide the mechanism by which Kir6.2-Q52R stabilizes an open channel to cause neonatal diabetes.\nImpact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nAuthors: Joseph, R. E.; Wales, T. E.; Jayne, S.; Britton, R. G.; Fulton, D. B.; Engen, J. R.; Dyer, M. J. S.; Andreotti, A.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572223\nInhibition of Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph, R.E., et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60470). Here we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.\nSubstrate-dependent oxidative inactivation of a W-dependent formate dehydrogenase involving selenocysteine displacement.\nAuthors: Vilela-Alves, G.; Manuel, R. R.; Viegas, A.; Carpentier, P.; Biaso, F.; Guigliarelli, B.; Pereira, I. C.; Romao, M. J.; Mota, C.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.571421\nMetal-dependent formate dehydrogenases are very promising targets for enzyme optimization and design of bio-inspired catalysts for CO2 reduction, towards novel strategies for climate change mitigation. For effective application of these enzymes, the catalytic mechanism must be fully understood, and the molecular determinants clarified. Despite numerous studies, several doubts persist, namely regarding the role played by the possible dissociation of the SeCys ligand from the Mo/W active site. Additionally, the O2 sensitivity of these enzymes must also be understood as it poses an important obstacle for biotechnological applications. Here we present a combined biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural characterization of Desulfovibrio vulgaris FdhAB (DvFdhAB) when exposed to oxygen in the presence of a substrate (formate or CO2). This study reveals that O2 inactivation is promoted by the presence of either substrate and involves forming a new species in the active site, captured in the crystal structures, where the SeCys ligand is displaced from tungsten coordination and replaced by a dioxygen or peroxide molecule. This new form was reproducibly obtained and supports the conclusion that, although W-DvFdhAB can catalyze the oxidation of formate in the presence of oxygen for some minutes, it gets irreversibly inactivated after prolonged O2 exposure in the presence of either substrate. These results reveal that oxidative inactivation does not require reduction of the metal, as widely assumed, as it can also occur in the oxidized state in the presence of CO2.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The human coronavirus HKU1 spike (S) glycoprotein engages host cell surface sialoglycans and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to initiate infection. The molecular basis of HKU1 binding to TMPRSS2 and determinants of host receptor tropism remain elusive. Here, we designed an active human TMPRSS2 construct enabling high-yield recombinant production in human cells of this key therapeutic target. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HKU1 RBD bound to human TMPRSS2 providing a blueprint of the interactions supporting viral entry and explaining the specificity for TMPRSS2 among human type 2 transmembrane serine proteases. We found that human, rat, hamster and camel TMPRSS2 promote HKU1 S-mediated entry into cells and identified key residues governing host receptor usage. Our data show that serum antibodies targeting the HKU1 RBD TMPRSS2 binding-site are key for neutralization and that HKU1 uses conformational masking and glycan shielding to balance immune evasion and receptor engagement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse bacteria and archaea use atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) as an energy source during long-term survival. This process enhances the biodiversity of soil and marine ecosystems globally and removes 250 million tonnes of a toxic, climate-relevant pollutant from the atmosphere each year. Bacteria use [MoCu]-carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (Mo-CODH) to convert CO to carbon dioxide, then transfer the liberated high-energy electrons to the aerobic respiratory chain. However, given no high-affinity Mo-CODH has been purified, it is unknown how these enzymes oxidise CO at low concentrations and interact with the respiratory chain. Here we resolve these knowledge gaps by analysing Mo-CODH (CoxSML) and its hypothetical partner CoxG from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Kinetic and electrochemical analyses show purified Mo-CODH is a highly active high-affinity enzyme (Km = 139 nM, kcat = 54.2 s-1). Based on its 1.85 [A] resolution cryoEM structure, Mo-CODH forms a CoxSML homodimer similar to characterised low-affinity homologs, but has distinct active site coordination and narrower gas channels that may modulate affinity. We provide structural, biochemical, and genetic evidence that Mo-CODH transfers CO-derived electrons to the aerobic respiratory chain via the membrane-bound menaquinone-binding protein CoxG. Consistently, CoxG is required for CO-driven respiration, extracts menaquinone from mycobacterial membranes, and binds quinones in a hydrophobic pocket. Finally, we show that Mo-CODH and CoxG genetically and structurally associate in diverse bacteria and archaea. These findings reveal the basis of a biogeochemically and ecologically important process, while demonstrating that the newly discovered process of long-range quinone transport is a general mechanism of energy conservation, which convergently evolved on multiple occasions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">cGAMP is a second messenger that is synthesized in the cytosol upon detection of cytosolic dsDNA and passed between cells to facilitate downstream immune signaling. ENPP1, an extracellular enzyme, was the only metazoan cGAMP hydrolase known to regulate cGAMP levels to dampen anti-cancer immunity. Here, we uncover ENPP3 as the second and only other metazoan cGAMP hydrolase under homeostatic conditions. ENPP3 has a tissue expression pattern distinct from that of ENPP1 and accounts for all remaining cGAMP hydrolysis activity in mice lacking ENPP1. Importantly, we also show that as with ENPP1, selectively abolishing ENPP3&#39;s cGAMP hydrolase activity results in diminished cancer growth and metastasis of certain tumor types. Both ENPP1 and ENPP3 are extracellular enzymes, suggesting the dominant role that extracellular cGAMP must play as a mediator of cell-cell innate immune communication. Our work clearly shows that ENPP1 and ENPP3 non-redundantly dampen extracellular cGAMP-STING signaling, pointing to ENPP3 as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) is a central catabolic pathway with broad implications for organismal health. However, various fatty acids are largely incompatible with standard FAO machinery until they are modified by other enzymes. Included among these are the 4-hydroxy acids (4-HAs)--fatty acids hydroxylated at the 4 ({gamma}) position--which can be provided from dietary intake, lipid peroxidation, and certain drugs of abuse. Here, we reveal that two atypical and poorly characterized acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs), ACAD10 and ACAD11, drive 4-HA catabolism in mice. Unlike other ACADs, ACAD10 and ACAD11 feature kinase domains N-terminal to their ACAD domains that phosphorylate the 4-OH position as a requisite step in the conversion of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoAs into 2-enoyl-CoAs--conventional FAO intermediates. Our ACAD11 cryo-EM structure and molecular modeling reveal a unique binding pocket capable of accommodating this phosphorylated intermediate. We further show that ACAD10 is mitochondrial and necessary for catabolizing shorter-chain 4-HAs, whereas ACAD11 is peroxisomal and enables longer-chain 4-HA catabolism. Mice lacking ACAD11 accumulate 4-HAs in their plasma while comparable 3- and 5-hydroxy acids remain unchanged. Collectively, this work defines ACAD10 and ACAD11 as the primary gatekeepers of mammalian 4-HA catabolism and sets the stage for broader investigations into the ramifications of aberrant 4-HA metabolism in human health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 form a human protein-disaggregase system that solubilizes and reactivates proteins trapped in aggregated states. However, this system fails to maintain proteostasis in fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we potentiate the human Hsp70-disaggregase system pharmacologically. By scouring a collection of dihydropyrimidines, we disambiguate a small molecule that specifically stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system against disordered aggregates and -synuclein fibrils. The newly identified lead compound stimulates the disaggregase activity of multiple active human Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp110 chaperone sets, with selectivity for combinations that include DnaJB1 or DnaJB4 as the Hsp40. We find that the relative stoichiometry of Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 dictates disaggregase activity. Remarkably, our lead compound shifts the composition of active chaperone stoichiometries by preferentially activating combinations with lower DnaJB1 concentrations. Our findings unveil a small molecule that stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system, even at suboptimal chaperone stoichiometries, which could be developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 alters the antigenicity of the immunodominant spike (S) receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain, undermining the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. To overcome this challenge, we set out to develop a vaccine focusing antibody responses on the highly conserved but metastable S2 subunit, which folds as a spring-loaded fusion machinery. Here, we describe a protein design strategy enabling prefusion-stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit and high yield recombinant expression of trimers with native structure and antigenicity. We demonstrate that our design strategy is broadly generalizable to all sarbecoviruses, as exemplified with the SARS-CoV-1 (clade 1a) and PRD-0038 (clade 3) S2 fusion machineries. Immunization of mice with a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S2 trimer vaccine elicits broadly reactive sarbecovirus antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers of comparable magnitude against Wuhan-Hu-1 and the immune evasive XBB.1.5 variant. Vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss and disease upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5, providing proof-of-principle for fusion machinery sarbecovirus vaccines motivating future development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Doa10 (MARCH6 in metazoans) is a large polytopic membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays an important role in quality control of cytosolic and ER proteins. Although Doa10 is highly conserved across eukaryotes, it is not understood how Doa10 recognizes its substrates. Here, we defined the substrate recognition mechanism of Doa10 by structural and functional analyses on Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doa10 and its well-defined degron Deg1. Cryo-EM analysis shows that Doa10 has unusual architecture with a large lipid-filled central cavity, and its conserved middle domain forms an additional water-filled lateral tunnel open to the cytosol. Our biochemical data and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the entrance of the substrates degron peptide into the lateral tunnel is required for efficient polyubiquitination. The N- and C-terminal membrane domains of Doa10 seem to form fence-like features to restrict polyubiquitination to those proteins that can access the central cavity and lateral tunnel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of four pore-lining Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits, control insulin secretion in pancreatic {beta}-cells. KATP channel opening is stimulated by PIP2 and inhibited by ATP. Mutations that increase channel opening by PIP2 reduce ATP inhibition and cause neonatal diabetes. Although considerable evidence has implicated a role for PIP2 in KATP channel function, previously solved open-channel structures have lacked bound PIP2, and mechanisms by which PIP2 regulates KATP channels remain unresolved. Here, we report cryoEM structure of a KATP channel harboring the neonatal diabetes mutation Kir6.2-Q52R, bound to natural C18:0/C20:4 long-chain PI(4,5)P2 in open conformation. The structure reveals two adjacent PIP2 molecules between SUR1 and Kir6.2. The first PIP2 binding site is conserved among PIP2-gated Kir channels. The second site forms uniquely in KATP at the interface of Kir6.2 and SUR1. Functional studies demonstrate both binding sites determine channel activity. Kir6.2 pore opening is associated with a twist of the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain and a rotation of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1, which widens the inhibitory ATP binding pocket to disfavor ATP binding. The open conformation is particularly stabilized by the Kir6.2-Q52R residue through cation-{pi} bonding with SUR1 - W51. Together, these results uncover the cooperation between SUR1 and Kir6.2 in PIP2 binding and gating, explain the antagonistic regulation of KATP channels by PIP2 and ATP, and provide the mechanism by which Kir6.2-Q52R stabilizes an open channel to cause neonatal diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inhibition of Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph, R.E., et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60470). Here we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metal-dependent formate dehydrogenases are very promising targets for enzyme optimization and design of bio-inspired catalysts for CO2 reduction, towards novel strategies for climate change mitigation. For effective application of these enzymes, the catalytic mechanism must be fully understood, and the molecular determinants clarified. Despite numerous studies, several doubts persist, namely regarding the role played by the possible dissociation of the SeCys ligand from the Mo/W active site. Additionally, the O2 sensitivity of these enzymes must also be understood as it poses an important obstacle for biotechnological applications. Here we present a combined biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural characterization of Desulfovibrio vulgaris FdhAB (DvFdhAB) when exposed to oxygen in the presence of a substrate (formate or CO2). This study reveals that O2 inactivation is promoted by the presence of either substrate and involves forming a new species in the active site, captured in the crystal structures, where the SeCys ligand is displaced from tungsten coordination and replaced by a dioxygen or peroxide molecule. This new form was reproducibly obtained and supports the conclusion that, although W-DvFdhAB can catalyze the oxidation of formate in the presence of oxygen for some minutes, it gets irreversibly inactivated after prolonged O2 exposure in the presence of either substrate. These results reveal that oxidative inactivation does not require reduction of the metal, as widely assumed, as it can also occur in the oxidized state in the presence of CO2.</p>
