Here we explore the use of soft-introspective variational autoencoders for reducing the challenge of dimensionality in the protein structure ensemble generation problem. We convert high-dimensional protein structural data into a continuous, low-dimensional representation, carry out search in this space guided by a structure quality metric, then use RoseTTAFold to generate 3D structures. We use this approach to generate ensembles for the cancer relevant protein K-Ras, training the VAE on a subset of the available K-Ras crystal structures and MD simulation snapshots, and assessing the extent of sampling close to crystal structures withheld from training. We find that our latent space sampling procedure rapidly generates ensembles with high structural quality and is able to sample within 1 angstrom of held out crystal structures, with a consistency higher than MD simulation or AlphaFold2 prediction. The sampled structures sufficiently recapitulate the cryptic pockets in the held-out K-Ras structures to allow for small molecule docking.\nGenetic and functional diversity of beta-N-acetylgalactosamine residue-targeting glycosidases expanded by deep-sea metagenome\nAuthors: Sumida, T.; Hiraoka, S.; Usui, K.; Ishiwata, A.; Sengoku, T.; Stubbs, K. A.; Tanaka, K.; Deguchi, S.; Fushinobu, S.; Nunoura, T.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550916\n{beta}-N-Acetylgalactosamine-containing glycans play essential roles in several biological processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune responses. {beta}-N-Acetylgalactosaminidases hydrolyze {beta}-N-acetylgalactosamine linkages of various glycoconjugates. However, their biological significance remains ambiguous, primarily because only one type of enzyme, exo-{beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases that specifically act on {beta}-N-acetylgalactosamine residues, has been documented so far. In this study, we identified three novel glycoside hydrolase families distributed among all three domains of life and characterized eight novel {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases and {beta}-N-acetylhexosaminidase through sequence-based screening of deep-sea metagenomes and subsequent searching of public protein databases. Despite low sequence similarity, the crystal structures of these enzymes demonstrate that all enzymes share a prototype structure and diversify their substrate specificities (endo-, dual-endo/exo-, and exo-) through the accumulation of mutations and insertional amino acid sequences. The diverse {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases reported in this study could facilitate the comprehension of their structures and functions and present novel evolutionary pathways for expanding their substrate specificity.\nRapid and automated design of two-component protein nanomaterials using ProteinMPNN\nAuthors: de Haas, R.

P.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551935\nThe design of novel protein-protein interfaces using physics-based design methods such as Rosetta requires substantial computational resources and manual refinement by expert structural biologists. A new generation of deep learning methods promises to simplify protein-protein interface design and enable its application to a wide variety of problems by researchers from various scientific disciplines. Here we test the ability of a deep learning method for protein sequence design, ProteinMPNN, to design two-component tetrahedral protein nanomaterials and benchmark its performance against Rosetta. ProteinMPNN had a similar success rate to Rosetta, yielding 13 new experimentally confirmed assemblies, but required orders of magnitude less computation and no manual refinement. The interfaces designed by ProteinMPNN were substantially more polar than those designed by Rosetta, which facilitated in vitro assembly of the designed nanomaterials from independently purified components. Crystal structures of several of the assemblies confirmed the accuracy of the design method at high resolution. Our results showcase the potential of deep learning-based methods to unlock the widespread application of designed protein-protein interfaces and self-assembling protein nanomaterials in biotechnology.\nIdentification of factors that prevent ribosome stalling during early elongation\nAuthors: Hong, H.-R.; Prince, C. R.; Wu, L.; Feaga, H. A.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552005\nProtein synthesis is catalyzed by the ribosome and a host of highly conserved elongation factors. Most elongation factors that are conserved in all domains of life are essential, such as EF-Tu (e/aEF1A) and EF-G (e/aEF2). In contrast, the universally conserved elongation factor P (EF-P/eIF5A) is essential in eukaryotes but is dispensable in most bacteria. EF-P prevents ribosome stalling at difficult-to translate sequences, especially polyprolines. Since efp deletion phenotypes range from modest to lethal in different bacterial species, we hypothesized that some bacteria encode an uncharacterized elongation factor with compensatory functions. To identify this factor, we used Tn-seq to screen for genes that are essential in the absence of EF-P in Bacillus subtilis. This screen identified YfmR, a member of the ABCF family of ATPases, as a translation factor that is essential when efp is deleted. We find that depleting YfmR from {triangleup}efp cells decreases actively translating ribosomes and increases free ribosomal subunits bound to initiator tRNA, suggesting that ribosomes stall in early elongation. We also find that deleting efp from the spore-forming pathogen Bacillus anthracis causes a severe survival defect in liquid culture and in the presence of macrophages. B. anthracis {triangleup}efp also does not produce detectable spores. We find that heterologous expression of B. subtilis YfmR in B. anthracis {triangleup}efp cells partially rescues the severe growth and sporulation defects of this mutant. Our results therefore identify YfmR as an important translation factor that becomes essential in the absence of EF-P, and suggest that the essential function of YfmR and EF-P is to assist translation during early elongation.\nMesoscale DNA Features Impact APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B Deaminase Activity and Shape Tumor Mutational Landscapes\nAuthors: Sanchez, A.; Ortega, P.; Sakhtemani, R.; Manjunath, L.; Oh, S.; Bournique, E.; Becker, A.; Kim, K.; Durfee, C.; Temiz, N. A.; Chen, X.; Harris, R.; Lawrence, M.; Buisson, R.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551499\nAntiviral DNA cytosine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are major sources of mutations in cancer by catalyzing cytosine-to-uracil deamination. APOBEC3A preferentially targets singlestranded DNAs, with a noted affinity for DNA regions that adopt stem-loop secondary structures. However, the detailed substrate preferences of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B have been fully established, and the specific influence of the DNA sequence on APOBEC3A APOBEC3B deaminase activity remains to be investigated. Here, we find that APOBEC3B selectively targets DNA stem-loop structures, and they are distinct from those subjected deamination by APOBEC3A. We develop Oligo-seq, a novel in vitro sequencing-based to identify specific sequence contexts promoting APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B activity. Through this approach, we demonstrate that APOBEC3A an APOBEC3B deaminase activity is strongly regulated by specific sequences surrounding the targeted cytosine. Moreover, we identify structural features of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A responsible for their substrate preferences. Importantly, we determine that APOBEC3B-induced mutations in hairpin-forming sequences within tumor genomes differ from the DNA stem-loop sequences mutated by APOBEC3A. Together, our study provides evidence that APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B can generate mutation landscapes in cancer genomes, driven by their unique substrate selectivity.\nTargeted protein editing with an antibody-based system\nAuthors: Rimon, O.; Konc, J.; Roy Chowdhury, V.; Bernardes, G. J. L.; Vendruscolo, M.\nScore: 24.8, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551006\nThe chemical modification of proteins is one of the major mechanisms used to regulate the trafficking and function of these macromolecules in the cell. It is therefore of great interest to develop tools to exploit this type of modifications for applications in molecular biology, medicine and biotechnology. Here we present a method of using antibodies to perform post-translational covalent modifications of endogenous proteins in complex environments by exploiting proximity-driven chemistry. The method is based on the ability of antibodies to hold a weakly reactive group adjacently to its intended site of reaction by binding the target protein on a nearby epitope. We illustrate this approach by targeting the green fluorescent protein in increasingly complex environments.\nMicroED as a powerful tool for structure determination of macrocyclic drug compounds directly from their powder formulations\nAuthors: Danelius, E.; Bu, G.; Wieske, L.; Gonen, T.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551405\nMacrocycles are important drug leads with many advantages including the ability to target flat and featureless binding sites as well as act as molecular chameleons and thereby reach intracellular targets. However, due to their complex structures and inherent flexibility, macrocycles are difficult to study structurally and there are limited structural data available. Herein, we use the cryo-EM method MicroED to determine the novel atomic structures of several macrocycles which have previously resisted structural determination. We show that structures of similar complexity can now be obtained rapidly from nanograms of material, and that different conformations of flexible compounds can be derived from the same experiment. These results will have impact on contemporary drug discovery as well as natural product exploration.\nStrategic engineering unlocks in vitro type II polyketide biosynthesis\nAuthors: Li, K.

K.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551649\nMicrobial type II polyketides serve as powerful medicinally relevant agents. These molecules are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) comprised of a core ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) and phosphopantetheinylated acyl carrier protein (holo-ACP). While engineering type II PKSs holds potential to unlock sustainable access to diverse bioactive molecules, the inability to obtain cognate type II KS-CLFs and holo-ACPs for in vitro studies represents a longstanding barrier. Herein, we share how the sequence and structural analysis of the Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7428 ACP allowed us to tune to a requisite weak yet specific interaction with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase to afford the holo-ACP. This, coupled with our ability to heterologously express the cognate KS-CLF in high quantities, unlocked access to polyketide products via in vitro multienzyme assembly. We hope this work inspires future studies of type II PKSs that have previously evaded heterologous expression or have yet to be explored.

C.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551522\nA recent study demonstrated a substantial signal increase when employing a 0.5% acetic acid buffer additive instead of the traditional 0.1% formic acid used in shotgun proteomics. In this study I compare these two buffers for a dilution series of tryptic digests down to 20 picograms peptide on column on a TIMSTOF single cell proteome (SCP) system. I observe a comparable relative level of signal increase as previously reported, which translates to improvements in proteome coverage at every peptide load assessed. The relative increase in peptide identifications is more apparent at lower concentrations with a striking 1.8-fold more peptides identified at 20 pg peptide load, resulting in over 2,000 protein groups identified in 30 minutes on this system. These results translate well to isolated single human cancer cells allowing over 1,000 protein groups to be identified in single human cells processed using a simple one step method in standard 96-well plates.

S.; Tanaka, Y.; Mori, T.; Ichikawa, M.; Tsukazaki, T.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550924\nUptake of thiosulfate ions as an inorganic sulfur source from the environment is important for bacterial sulfur assimilation. Recently, a selective thiosulfate uptake pathway involving membrane protein YeeE (TsuA) was characterized. However, the precise function of YeeE and a putative cofactor in the thiosulfate ion uptake pathway remained unclear. Here, we assessed selective thiosulfate transport via YeeE in vitro and characterized YeeD (TsuB) as an adjacent and essential cofactor for YeeE-mediated thiosulfate uptake in vivo. We further showed that YeeD possesses thiosulfate decomposition activity and that a conserved cysteine in YeeD was modified in several forms in the presence of thiosulfate. Finally, the crystal structure of a YeeE-YeeD fusion protein at 2.6-[A] resolution revealed their interactions. The association was evaluated by a binding assay using purified proteins. Based on these results, a model of the sophisticated uptake of thiosulfate ions by YeeE and YeeD is proposed.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mapping the ensemble of protein conformations that contribute to function and can be targeted by small molecule drugs remains an outstanding challenge. Here we explore the use of soft-introspective variational autoencoders for reducing the challenge of dimensionality in the protein structure ensemble generation problem. We convert high-dimensional protein structural data into a continuous, low-dimensional representation, carry out search in this space guided by a structure quality metric, then use RoseTTAFold to generate 3D structures. We use this approach to generate ensembles for the cancer relevant protein K-Ras, training the VAE on a subset of the available K-Ras crystal structures and MD simulation snapshots, and assessing the extent of sampling close to crystal structures withheld from training. We find that our latent space sampling procedure rapidly generates ensembles with high structural quality and is able to sample within 1 angstrom of held out crystal structures, with a consistency higher than MD simulation or AlphaFold2 prediction. The sampled structures sufficiently recapitulate the cryptic pockets in the held-out K-Ras structures to allow for small molecule docking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">{beta}-N-Acetylgalactosamine-containing glycans play essential roles in several biological processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune responses. {beta}-N-Acetylgalactosaminidases hydrolyze {beta}-N-acetylgalactosamine linkages of various glycoconjugates. However, their biological significance remains ambiguous, primarily because only one type of enzyme, exo-{beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases that specifically act on {beta}-N-acetylgalactosamine residues, has been documented so far. In this study, we identified three novel glycoside hydrolase families distributed among all three domains of life and characterized eight novel {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases and {beta}-N-acetylhexosaminidase through sequence-based screening of deep-sea metagenomes and subsequent searching of public protein databases. Despite low sequence similarity, the crystal structures of these enzymes demonstrate that all enzymes share a prototype structure and diversify their substrate specificities (endo-, dual-endo/exo-, and exo-) through the accumulation of mutations and insertional amino acid sequences. The diverse {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases reported in this study could facilitate the comprehension of their structures and functions and present novel evolutionary pathways for expanding their substrate specificity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The design of novel protein-protein interfaces using physics-based design methods such as Rosetta requires substantial computational resources and manual refinement by expert structural biologists. A new generation of deep learning methods promises to simplify protein-protein interface design and enable its application to a wide variety of problems by researchers from various scientific disciplines. Here we test the ability of a deep learning method for protein sequence design, ProteinMPNN, to design two-component tetrahedral protein nanomaterials and benchmark its performance against Rosetta. ProteinMPNN had a similar success rate to Rosetta, yielding 13 new experimentally confirmed assemblies, but required orders of magnitude less computation and no manual refinement. The interfaces designed by ProteinMPNN were substantially more polar than those designed by Rosetta, which facilitated in vitro assembly of the designed nanomaterials from independently purified components. Crystal structures of several of the assemblies confirmed the accuracy of the design method at high resolution. Our results showcase the potential of deep learning-based methods to unlock the widespread application of designed protein-protein interfaces and self-assembling protein nanomaterials in biotechnology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein synthesis is catalyzed by the ribosome and a host of highly conserved elongation factors. Most elongation factors that are conserved in all domains of life are essential, such as EF-Tu (e/aEF1A) and EF-G (e/aEF2). In contrast, the universally conserved elongation factor P (EF-P/eIF5A) is essential in eukaryotes but is dispensable in most bacteria. EF-P prevents ribosome stalling at difficult-to translate sequences, especially polyprolines. Since efp deletion phenotypes range from modest to lethal in different bacterial species, we hypothesized that some bacteria encode an uncharacterized elongation factor with compensatory functions. To identify this factor, we used Tn-seq to screen for genes that are essential in the absence of EF-P in Bacillus subtilis. This screen identified YfmR, a member of the ABCF family of ATPases, as a translation factor that is essential when efp is deleted. We find that depleting YfmR from {triangleup}efp cells decreases actively translating ribosomes and increases free ribosomal subunits bound to initiator tRNA, suggesting that ribosomes stall in early elongation. We also find that deleting efp from the spore-forming pathogen Bacillus anthracis causes a severe survival defect in liquid culture and in the presence of macrophages. B. anthracis {triangleup}efp also does not produce detectable spores. We find that heterologous expression of B. subtilis YfmR in B. anthracis {triangleup}efp cells partially rescues the severe growth and sporulation defects of this mutant. Our results therefore identify YfmR as an important translation factor that becomes essential in the absence of EF-P, and suggest that the essential function of YfmR and EF-P is to assist translation during early elongation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antiviral DNA cytosine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are major sources of mutations in cancer by catalyzing cytosine-to-uracil deamination. APOBEC3A preferentially targets singlestranded DNAs, with a noted affinity for DNA regions that adopt stem-loop secondary structures. However, the detailed substrate preferences of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B have been fully established, and the specific influence of the DNA sequence on APOBEC3A APOBEC3B deaminase activity remains to be investigated. Here, we find that APOBEC3B selectively targets DNA stem-loop structures, and they are distinct from those subjected deamination by APOBEC3A. We develop Oligo-seq, a novel in vitro sequencing-based to identify specific sequence contexts promoting APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B activity. Through this approach, we demonstrate that APOBEC3A an APOBEC3B deaminase activity is strongly regulated by specific sequences surrounding the targeted cytosine. Moreover, we identify structural features of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A responsible for their substrate preferences. Importantly, we determine that APOBEC3B-induced mutations in hairpin-forming sequences within tumor genomes differ from the DNA stem-loop sequences mutated by APOBEC3A. Together, our study provides evidence that APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B can generate mutation landscapes in cancer genomes, driven by their unique substrate selectivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The chemical modification of proteins is one of the major mechanisms used to regulate the trafficking and function of these macromolecules in the cell. It is therefore of great interest to develop tools to exploit this type of modifications for applications in molecular biology, medicine and biotechnology. Here we present a method of using antibodies to perform post-translational covalent modifications of endogenous proteins in complex environments by exploiting proximity-driven chemistry. The method is based on the ability of antibodies to hold a weakly reactive group adjacently to its intended site of reaction by binding the target protein on a nearby epitope. We illustrate this approach by targeting the green fluorescent protein in increasingly complex environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Macrocycles are important drug leads with many advantages including the ability to target flat and featureless binding sites as well as act as molecular chameleons and thereby reach intracellular targets. However, due to their complex structures and inherent flexibility, macrocycles are difficult to study structurally and there are limited structural data available. Herein, we use the cryo-EM method MicroED to determine the novel atomic structures of several macrocycles which have previously resisted structural determination. We show that structures of similar complexity can now be obtained rapidly from nanograms of material, and that different conformations of flexible compounds can be derived from the same experiment. These results will have impact on contemporary drug discovery as well as natural product exploration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial type II polyketides serve as powerful medicinally relevant agents. These molecules are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) comprised of a core ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) and phosphopantetheinylated acyl carrier protein (holo-ACP). While engineering type II PKSs holds potential to unlock sustainable access to diverse bioactive molecules, the inability to obtain cognate type II KS-CLFs and holo-ACPs for in vitro studies represents a longstanding barrier. Herein, we share how the sequence and structural analysis of the Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7428 ACP allowed us to tune to a requisite weak yet specific interaction with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase to afford the holo-ACP. This, coupled with our ability to heterologously express the cognate KS-CLF in high quantities, unlocked access to polyketide products via in vitro multienzyme assembly. We hope this work inspires future studies of type II PKSs that have previously evaded heterologous expression or have yet to be explored.

        <p class="abstract">A recent study demonstrated a substantial signal increase when employing a 0.5% acetic acid buffer additive instead of the traditional 0.1% formic acid used in shotgun proteomics. In this study I compare these two buffers for a dilution series of tryptic digests down to 20 picograms peptide on column on a TIMSTOF single cell proteome (SCP) system. I observe a comparable relative level of signal increase as previously reported, which translates to improvements in proteome coverage at every peptide load assessed. The relative increase in peptide identifications is more apparent at lower concentrations with a striking 1.8-fold more peptides identified at 20 pg peptide load, resulting in over 2,000 protein groups identified in 30 minutes on this system. These results translate well to isolated single human cancer cells allowing over 1,000 protein groups to be identified in single human cells processed using a simple one step method in standard 96-well plates.

        <p class="abstract">Uptake of thiosulfate ions as an inorganic sulfur source from the environment is important for bacterial sulfur assimilation. Recently, a selective thiosulfate uptake pathway involving membrane protein YeeE (TsuA) was characterized. However, the precise function of YeeE and a putative cofactor in the thiosulfate ion uptake pathway remained unclear. Here, we assessed selective thiosulfate transport via YeeE in vitro and characterized YeeD (TsuB) as an adjacent and essential cofactor for YeeE-mediated thiosulfate uptake in vivo. We further showed that YeeD possesses thiosulfate decomposition activity and that a conserved cysteine in YeeD was modified in several forms in the presence of thiosulfate. Finally, the crystal structure of a YeeE-YeeD fusion protein at 2.6-[A] resolution revealed their interactions. The association was evaluated by a binding assay using purified proteins. Based on these results, a model of the sophisticated uptake of thiosulfate ions by YeeE and YeeD is proposed.</p>
