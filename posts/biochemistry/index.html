S.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566644\nSkeletal muscle regulates glucose uptake in response to insulin and exercise which is critical for maintaining metabolic health. We conducted a comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis of skeletal muscle from healthy people in response to an acute bout of exercise or insulin stimulation by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Our analysis revealed 233 phosphosites regulated by both exercise and insulin of which most phosphosites were regulated in opposite directions. However, 71 phosphosites on 55 proteins displayed regulation in the same direction, indicating a potential convergence of signaling pathways. We identified the vesicle-associated protein, REPS1, to be phosphorylated at Ser709 in response to both insulin and exercise. REPS1 protein level and Ser709 phosphorylation were closely related to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and required for maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Furthermore, we observed that insulin triggered phosphorylation of REPS1 Ser709 via P90S6 kinase (RSK) and is impaired in mice and humans with insulin resistance. Collectively, REPS1 is a convergence point for insulin and exercise signaling and a promising therapeutic target in insulin resistance.\nA double-ring of human RAD52 remodels replication forks restricting fork reversal\nAuthors: Honda, M.; Razzaghi, M.; Gaur, P.; Malacaria, E.; Di Biagi, L.; Aiello, F. A.; Paintsil, E. A.; Stanfield, A.; Deppe, B. J.; Gakhar, L.; Schnicker, N. J.; Spies, M. A.; Pichierri, P.; Spies, M.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.566657\nHuman RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the ssDNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.\nDeuteration provides a general strategy to enhance azobenzene-based photopharmacology\nAuthors: Rossmann, K.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, A. J.; Bhuyan, R.; Boerjesson, K.; Levitz, J.; Broichhagen, J.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566420\nHerein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity, photoswitch efficiency, and photoswitch kinetics with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene-based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein-coupled receptor function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.\nDesign of a symmetry-broken tetrahedral protein cage by a method of internal steric occlusion\nAuthors: Gladkov, N.; Scott, E. A.; Meador, K.; Lee, E. J.; Laganowsky, A. D.; Yeates, T. O.; Castells-Graells, R.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566319\nMethods in protein design have made it possible to create large and complex, self-assembling protein cages with diverse applications. These have largely been based on highly symmetric forms exemplified by the Platonic solids. Prospective applications of protein cages would be expanded by strategies for breaking the designed symmetry, e.g., so that only one or a few (instead of many) copies of an exterior domain or motif might be displayed on their surfaces. Here we demonstrate a straightforward design approach for creating symmetry-broken protein cages able to display singular copies of outward-facing domains. We modify the subunit of an otherwise symmetric protein cage through fusion to a small inward-facing domain, only one copy of which can be accommodated in the cage interior. Using biochemical methods and native mass spectrometry, we show that co-expression of the original subunit and the modified subunit, which is further fused to an outward-facing anti-GFP DARPin domain, leads to self-assembly of a protein cage presenting just one copy of the DARPin protein on its exterior. This strategy of designed occlusion provides a facile route for creating new types of protein cages with unique properties.\nUbiquitinated protein levels remain high during ageing in C. elegans\nAuthors: Daigle, S. E.; Doucet, S.; Lapierre, L. R.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566011\nA wealth of literature in different model organisms have shown that proteostasis declines with age, which results in the accumulation of aggregated proteins that generally carry polyubiquitin chains. In Koyuncu et al. (Nature, 2021), the authors use a relatively mild homogenization approach to analyze total polyubiquitinated protein levels longitudinally in C. elegans and found that the overall level of polyubiquitinated proteins decreases in wild-type nematodes. Specifically, the substantial presence of polyubiquitinated proteins in early adulthood markedly decreases at day 10 and 15 of adulthood. This finding represents the central basis of their study where they subsequently suggest that age-dependent decrease in protein polyubiquitination in wild-type animals is due to enhanced deubiquitination. Here, we find that the mild homogenization of C. elegans used in Koyuncu et al. fails to properly extract all C. elegans proteins, because it largely omits relatively insoluble proteins in the pellet. When we perform complete homogenization of wild-type nematode proteins using SDS, sonication and heat, we unequivocally observe that polyubiquitinated protein levels do not decrease with age in C. elegans. Overall, the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins remains relatively constant post-reproduction. Therefore, our findings invalidate the main conclusion of Koyuncu et al. that the ubiquitinated proteome is rewired during ageing and demonstrate that C. elegans harbor polyubiquitinated proteins throughout their lifespan.\nStructure and position-specific interactions of prion-like domains in transcription factor Efg1 phase separation\nAuthors: Zheng, T.; Wang, S.-H.; Fawzi, N. L.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566450\nCandida albicans, a prominent member of the human microbiome, can make an opportunistic switch from commensal coexistence to pathogenicity accompanied by an epigenetic shift between the white and opaque cell states. This transcriptional switch is under precise regulation by a set of transcription factors (TFs), with Enhanced Filamentous Growth Protein 1 (Efg1) playing a central role. Previous research has emphasized the importance of Egf1s prion-like domain (PrLD) and the proteins ability to undergo phase separation for the white-to-opaque transition of C. albicans. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Efg1 phase separation have remained underexplored. In this study, we delved into the biophysical basis of Efg1 phase separation, revealing the significant contribution of both N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) PrLDs. Through NMR structural analysis, we found that Efg1 N-PrLD and C-PrLD are mostly disordered though have prominent partial -helical secondary structures in both domains. NMR titration experiments suggest that the partially helical structures in N-PrLD act as hubs for self-interaction as well as Efg1 interaction with RNA. Using condensed-phase NMR spectroscopy, we uncovered diverse amino acid interactions underlying Efg1 phase separation. Particularly, we highlight the indispensable role of tyrosine residues within the transient -helical structures of PrLDs particularly in the N-PrLD compared to the C-PrLD in stabilizing phase separation. Our study provides evidence that the transient -helical structure is present in the phase separated state and highlights the particular importance of aromatic residues within these structures for phase separation. Together, these results enhance the understanding of C. albicans TF interactions that lead to virulence and provide a crucial foundation for potential antifungal therapies targeting the transcriptional switch. Statement of SignificancePhase separated condensates have been found across the domains of life and many types of cells. To understand their varied functions, seeing the residue-by-residue details of the structure and interactions of component protein constituents is essential. A set of transcription factors that phase-separate controls cell fate of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Here, we examine the structural and interaction details of a main regulator of this process, Efg1, using NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays. We find Efg1s phase-separating domains are not entirely disordered as often assumed but in fact contain helical regions that persist upon phase separation. We also reveal the balance of contacts formed in the condensed phase and the importance of specific residues and regions in phase separation.\nDual-Probe Activity-Based Protein Profiling Reveals Site-Specific Differences in Protein Binding of EGFR-Directed Drugs\nAuthors: van Bergen, W.; Fiala, J.; Heck, A. J. R.; Baggelaar, M. P.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.562725\nComparative, dose-dependent analysis of interactions between small molecule drugs and their targets, as well as off-targets, in complex proteomes is crucial for selecting optimal drug candidates. The affinity of small molecules for targeted proteins is largely dictated by interactions between amino acid side chains and these drugs. Thus, studying drug-protein interactions at an amino acid resolution provides a comprehensive understanding of drug selectivity and efficacy. In this study, we further refined the site-specific activity-based protein profiling strategy, PhosID-ABPP, on a timsTOF HT mass spectrometer. This refinement enables dual dose-dependent competition of inhibitors within a single cellular proteome. Here, a comparative analysis of two activity-based probes (ABPs), developed to selectively target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), namely PF-06672131 and PF-6422899, facilitated the simultaneous identification of ABP-specific binding sites at a proteome-wide scale within a cellular proteome. Dose-dependent probe-binding preferences for proteinaceous cysteines, even at low nanomolar ABP concentrations, could be revealed. Notably, while both ABPs showed comparable affinities for the EGFR, PF-06672131 had a broader off-target reactivity profile. In contrast, PF-6422899 exhibited higher affinity for the ERBB2 receptor and bound to catalytic cysteines in several other enzymes, which is likely to disrupt their catalytic activity. Notably, PF-06672131 also effectively labeled ADP/ATP translocase proteins at a concentration of just 1 nanomolar. Additionally, analysis of different binding sites within the EGF receptor and the voltage-dependent anion channel 2 revealed secondary binding sites of both probes and provided insights into the binding poses of inhibitors on these proteins. Insights from the PhosID-ABPP analysis of these two ABPs serve as a valuable resource for understanding drug on- and off-target engagement in a dose- and site-specific manner.\nAsymmetrical Bi-antennary Glycans Prepared by a Stop-and-Go Strategy Reveal Receptor Binding Evolution of Human Influenza A Viruses\nAuthors: Ma, S.; Liu, L.; Eggink, D.; Herfst, S.; Fouchier, R. A. M.; de Vries, R. P.; Boons, G.-J.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566285\nGlycan binding properties of respiratory viruses have been difficult to probe due to a lack of biological relevant glycans for binding studies. Here, a stop-and-go chemoenzymatic methodology is presented that gave access to a panel of 32 asymmetrical bi-antennary N-glycans having various numbers of N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc) repeating units capped by 2,3- or 2,6-sialosides resembling structures found in airway tissues. It exploits that the branching enzymes MGAT1 and MGAT2 can utilize unnatural UDP-2-deoxy-2-trifluoro-N-acetamido-glucose (UDP-GlcNTFA) as donor. The TFA moiety of the resulting glycans can be hydrolyzed to give GlcNH2 at one of the antennae that temporarily blocks extension by glycosyl transferases. The N-glycans were printed as a microarray that was probed for receptor binding specificities of evolutionary distinct human A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. It was found that not only the sialoside type but also the length of the LacNAc chain and presentation at the 1,3-antenna of N-glycans is critical for binding. Early A(H3N2) viruses bound to 2,6-sialosides at a single LacNAc moiety at the 1,3-antenna whereas later viruses required the sialoside to be presented at a tri-LacNAc moiety. Surprisingly, most of the A(H3N2) viruses that appeared after 2021 regained binding capacity to sialosides presented at a di-LacNAc moiety. As a result, these viruses agglutinate erythrocytes again, commonly employed for antigenic characterization of influenza viruses. Human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have similar receptor binding properties as recent A(H3N2) viruses. The data indicates that an asymmetric N-glycan having 2,6-sialoside at a di-LacNAc moiety is a commonly employed receptor by human influenza A viruses.\nConserved 5-methyluridine tRNA modification modulates ribosome translocation\nAuthors: Jones, J. D.; Franco, M. K.; Tardu, M.; Smith, T. J.; Snyder, L. R.; Eyler, D. E.; Polikanov, Y. S.; Kennedy, R. T.; Niederer, R. O.; Koutmou, K. S.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566704\nWhile the centrality of post-transcriptional modifications to RNA biology has long been acknowledged, the function of the vast majority of modified sites remains to be discovered. Illustrative of this, there is not yet a discrete biological role assigned for one the most highly conserved modifications, 5-methyluridine at position 54 in tRNAs (m5U54). Here, we uncover contributions of m5U54 to both tRNA maturation and protein synthesis. Our mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that cells lacking the enzyme that installs m5U in the T-loop (TrmA in E. coli, Trm2 in S. cerevisiae) exhibit altered tRNA modifications patterns. Furthermore, m5U54 deficient tRNAs are desensitized to small molecules that prevent translocation in vitro. This finding is consistent with our observations that, relative to wild-type cells, trm2{Delta} cell growth and transcriptome-wide gene expression are less perturbed by translocation inhibitors. Together our data suggest a model in which m5U54 acts as an important modulator of tRNA maturation and translocation of the ribosome during protein synthesis.\nReplication of 25 microsatellite sequences by human DNA polymerase delta holoenzymes is dependent on dNTP and RPA levels\nAuthors: Pytko, K. G.; Dannenberg, R. L.; Eckert, K. A.; Hedglin, M.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566133\nDifficult-to-Replicate Sequences (DiToRS) are natural impediments in the human genome that inhibit DNA replication under endogenous replication. Some of the most widely-studied DiToRS are A+T-rich, high \"flexibility regions,\" including long stretches of perfect [AT/TA] microsatellite repeats that have the potential to collapse into hairpin structures when in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) form and are sites of recurrent structural variation and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks. Currently, it is unclear how these flexibility regions impact DNA replication, greatly limiting our fundamental understanding of human genome stability. To investigate replication through flexibility regions, we utilized FRET to characterize the effects of the major ssDNA-binding complex, RPA, on the structure of perfect [AT/TA]25 microsatellite repeats and also re-constituted human lagging strand replication to quantitatively characterize initial encounters of pol {delta} holoenzymes with A+T-rich DNA template sequences. The results indicate that [AT/TA]25 sequences adopt hairpin structures that are unwound by RPA and pol {delta} holoenzymes support dNTP incorporation through the [AT/TA]25 sequences as well as an A+T-rich, non-structure forming sequence. Furthermore, the extent of dNTP incorporation is dependent on the sequence of the DNA template and the concentration of dNTPs. Importantly, the effects of RPA on the replication of [AT/TA]25 sequences are dependent on the concentration of dNTPs, whereas the effects of RPA on the replication of an A+T-rich, non-structure forming sequence are independent of dNTP concentration. Collectively, these results reveal complexities in lagging strand replication and provide novel insights into how flexibility regions contribute to genome instability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle regulates glucose uptake in response to insulin and exercise which is critical for maintaining metabolic health. We conducted a comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis of skeletal muscle from healthy people in response to an acute bout of exercise or insulin stimulation by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Our analysis revealed 233 phosphosites regulated by both exercise and insulin of which most phosphosites were regulated in opposite directions. However, 71 phosphosites on 55 proteins displayed regulation in the same direction, indicating a potential convergence of signaling pathways. We identified the vesicle-associated protein, REPS1, to be phosphorylated at Ser709 in response to both insulin and exercise. REPS1 protein level and Ser709 phosphorylation were closely related to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and required for maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Furthermore, we observed that insulin triggered phosphorylation of REPS1 Ser709 via P90S6 kinase (RSK) and is impaired in mice and humans with insulin resistance. Collectively, REPS1 is a convergence point for insulin and exercise signaling and a promising therapeutic target in insulin resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the ssDNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.</p>

Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity, photoswitch efficiency, and photoswitch kinetics with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene-based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein-coupled receptor function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Methods in protein design have made it possible to create large and complex, self-assembling protein cages with diverse applications. These have largely been based on highly symmetric forms exemplified by the Platonic solids. Prospective applications of protein cages would be expanded by strategies for breaking the designed symmetry, e.g., so that only one or a few (instead of many) copies of an exterior domain or motif might be displayed on their surfaces. Here we demonstrate a straightforward design approach for creating symmetry-broken protein cages able to display singular copies of outward-facing domains. We modify the subunit of an otherwise symmetric protein cage through fusion to a small inward-facing domain, only one copy of which can be accommodated in the cage interior. Using biochemical methods and native mass spectrometry, we show that co-expression of the original subunit and the modified subunit, which is further fused to an outward-facing anti-GFP DARPin domain, leads to self-assembly of a protein cage presenting just one copy of the DARPin protein on its exterior. This strategy of designed occlusion provides a facile route for creating new types of protein cages with unique properties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A wealth of literature in different model organisms have shown that proteostasis declines with age, which results in the accumulation of aggregated proteins that generally carry polyubiquitin chains. In Koyuncu et al. (Nature, 2021), the authors use a relatively mild homogenization approach to analyze total polyubiquitinated protein levels longitudinally in C. elegans and found that the overall level of polyubiquitinated proteins decreases in wild-type nematodes. Specifically, the substantial presence of polyubiquitinated proteins in early adulthood markedly decreases at day 10 and 15 of adulthood. This finding represents the central basis of their study where they subsequently suggest that age-dependent decrease in protein polyubiquitination in wild-type animals is due to enhanced deubiquitination. Here, we find that the mild homogenization of C. elegans used in Koyuncu et al. fails to properly extract all C. elegans proteins, because it largely omits relatively insoluble proteins in the pellet. When we perform complete homogenization of wild-type nematode proteins using SDS, sonication and heat, we unequivocally observe that polyubiquitinated protein levels do not decrease with age in C. elegans. Overall, the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins remains relatively constant post-reproduction. Therefore, our findings invalidate the main conclusion of Koyuncu et al. that the ubiquitinated proteome is rewired during ageing and demonstrate that C. elegans harbor polyubiquitinated proteins throughout their lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Candida albicans, a prominent member of the human microbiome, can make an opportunistic switch from commensal coexistence to pathogenicity accompanied by an epigenetic shift between the white and opaque cell states. This transcriptional switch is under precise regulation by a set of transcription factors (TFs), with Enhanced Filamentous Growth Protein 1 (Efg1) playing a central role. Previous research has emphasized the importance of Egf1s prion-like domain (PrLD) and the proteins ability to undergo phase separation for the white-to-opaque transition of C. albicans. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Efg1 phase separation have remained underexplored. In this study, we delved into the biophysical basis of Efg1 phase separation, revealing the significant contribution of both N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) PrLDs. Through NMR structural analysis, we found that Efg1 N-PrLD and C-PrLD are mostly disordered though have prominent partial -helical secondary structures in both domains. NMR titration experiments suggest that the partially helical structures in N-PrLD act as hubs for self-interaction as well as Efg1 interaction with RNA. Using condensed-phase NMR spectroscopy, we uncovered diverse amino acid interactions underlying Efg1 phase separation. Particularly, we highlight the indispensable role of tyrosine residues within the transient -helical structures of PrLDs particularly in the N-PrLD compared to the C-PrLD in stabilizing phase separation. Our study provides evidence that the transient -helical structure is present in the phase separated state and highlights the particular importance of aromatic residues within these structures for phase separation. Together, these results enhance the understanding of C. albicans TF interactions that lead to virulence and provide a crucial foundation for potential antifungal therapies targeting the transcriptional switch.

Statement of SignificancePhase separated condensates have been found across the domains of life and many types of cells. To understand their varied functions, seeing the residue-by-residue details of the structure and interactions of component protein constituents is essential. A set of transcription factors that phase-separate controls cell fate of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Here, we examine the structural and interaction details of a main regulator of this process, Efg1, using NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays. We find Efg1s phase-separating domains are not entirely disordered as often assumed but in fact contain helical regions that persist upon phase separation. We also reveal the balance of contacts formed in the condensed phase and the importance of specific residues and regions in phase separation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Comparative, dose-dependent analysis of interactions between small molecule drugs and their targets, as well as off-targets, in complex proteomes is crucial for selecting optimal drug candidates. The affinity of small molecules for targeted proteins is largely dictated by interactions between amino acid side chains and these drugs. Thus, studying drug-protein interactions at an amino acid resolution provides a comprehensive understanding of drug selectivity and efficacy. In this study, we further refined the site-specific activity-based protein profiling strategy, PhosID-ABPP, on a timsTOF HT mass spectrometer. This refinement enables dual dose-dependent competition of inhibitors within a single cellular proteome. Here, a comparative analysis of two activity-based probes (ABPs), developed to selectively target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), namely PF-06672131 and PF-6422899, facilitated the simultaneous identification of ABP-specific binding sites at a proteome-wide scale within a cellular proteome. Dose-dependent probe-binding preferences for proteinaceous cysteines, even at low nanomolar ABP concentrations, could be revealed. Notably, while both ABPs showed comparable affinities for the EGFR, PF-06672131 had a broader off-target reactivity profile. In contrast, PF-6422899 exhibited higher affinity for the ERBB2 receptor and bound to catalytic cysteines in several other enzymes, which is likely to disrupt their catalytic activity. Notably, PF-06672131 also effectively labeled ADP/ATP translocase proteins at a concentration of just 1 nanomolar. Additionally, analysis of different binding sites within the EGF receptor and the voltage-dependent anion channel 2 revealed secondary binding sites of both probes and provided insights into the binding poses of inhibitors on these proteins. Insights from the PhosID-ABPP analysis of these two ABPs serve as a valuable resource for understanding drug on- and off-target engagement in a dose- and site-specific manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glycan binding properties of respiratory viruses have been difficult to probe due to a lack of biological relevant glycans for binding studies. Here, a stop-and-go chemoenzymatic methodology is presented that gave access to a panel of 32 asymmetrical bi-antennary N-glycans having various numbers of N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc) repeating units capped by 2,3- or 2,6-sialosides resembling structures found in airway tissues. It exploits that the branching enzymes MGAT1 and MGAT2 can utilize unnatural UDP-2-deoxy-2-trifluoro-N-acetamido-glucose (UDP-GlcNTFA) as donor. The TFA moiety of the resulting glycans can be hydrolyzed to give GlcNH2 at one of the antennae that temporarily blocks extension by glycosyl transferases. The N-glycans were printed as a microarray that was probed for receptor binding specificities of evolutionary distinct human A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. It was found that not only the sialoside type but also the length of the LacNAc chain and presentation at the 1,3-antenna of N-glycans is critical for binding. Early A(H3N2) viruses bound to 2,6-sialosides at a single LacNAc moiety at the 1,3-antenna whereas later viruses required the sialoside to be presented at a tri-LacNAc moiety. Surprisingly, most of the A(H3N2) viruses that appeared after 2021 regained binding capacity to sialosides presented at a di-LacNAc moiety. As a result, these viruses agglutinate erythrocytes again, commonly employed for antigenic characterization of influenza viruses. Human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have similar receptor binding properties as recent A(H3N2) viruses. The data indicates that an asymmetric N-glycan having 2,6-sialoside at a di-LacNAc moiety is a commonly employed receptor by human influenza A viruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the centrality of post-transcriptional modifications to RNA biology has long been acknowledged, the function of the vast majority of modified sites remains to be discovered. Illustrative of this, there is not yet a discrete biological role assigned for one the most highly conserved modifications, 5-methyluridine at position 54 in tRNAs (m5U54). Here, we uncover contributions of m5U54 to both tRNA maturation and protein synthesis. Our mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that cells lacking the enzyme that installs m5U in the T-loop (TrmA in E. coli, Trm2 in S. cerevisiae) exhibit altered tRNA modifications patterns. Furthermore, m5U54 deficient tRNAs are desensitized to small molecules that prevent translocation in vitro. This finding is consistent with our observations that, relative to wild-type cells, trm2{Delta} cell growth and transcriptome-wide gene expression are less perturbed by translocation inhibitors. Together our data suggest a model in which m5U54 acts as an important modulator of tRNA maturation and translocation of the ribosome during protein synthesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Difficult-to-Replicate Sequences (DiToRS) are natural impediments in the human genome that inhibit DNA replication under endogenous replication. Some of the most widely-studied DiToRS are A&#43;T-rich, high &#34;flexibility regions,&#34; including long stretches of perfect [AT/TA] microsatellite repeats that have the potential to collapse into hairpin structures when in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) form and are sites of recurrent structural variation and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks. Currently, it is unclear how these flexibility regions impact DNA replication, greatly limiting our fundamental understanding of human genome stability. To investigate replication through flexibility regions, we utilized FRET to characterize the effects of the major ssDNA-binding complex, RPA, on the structure of perfect [AT/TA]25 microsatellite repeats and also re-constituted human lagging strand replication to quantitatively characterize initial encounters of pol {delta} holoenzymes with A&#43;T-rich DNA template sequences. The results indicate that [AT/TA]25 sequences adopt hairpin structures that are unwound by RPA and pol {delta} holoenzymes support dNTP incorporation through the [AT/TA]25 sequences as well as an A&#43;T-rich, non-structure forming sequence. Furthermore, the extent of dNTP incorporation is dependent on the sequence of the DNA template and the concentration of dNTPs. Importantly, the effects of RPA on the replication of [AT/TA]25 sequences are dependent on the concentration of dNTPs, whereas the effects of RPA on the replication of an A&#43;T-rich, non-structure forming sequence are independent of dNTP concentration. Collectively, these results reveal complexities in lagging strand replication and provide novel insights into how flexibility regions contribute to genome instability.</p>
