However, the extent of deviation between protein structures in the mass spectrometer and in solution remains a matter of debate. Here, we uncover the gas-phase structure of {beta}-galactosidase using single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) down to 2.6 [A] resolution, enabled by soft-landing of mass-selected protein complexes onto cold TEM grids and in-situ ice coating. We find that large parts of the secondary and tertiary structure are retained from solution, with dehydration-driven subunit reorientation leading to consistent compaction in the gas phase. Our work enables visualizing the structure of gas-phase protein complexes from numerous experimental scenarios at side-chain resolution and demonstrates the possibility of more controlled cryo-EM sample preparation. One Sentence SummaryElectrospray ion-beam deposition on cold grids and in-vacuum ice growth enable cryo-EM of mass-selected proteins at 2.6[A].\nMolecular blueprints of the Langya virus attachment and fusion glycoproteins\nAuthors: Wang, Z.; McCallum, M.; Yan, L.; Sharkey, W.; Park, Y.-J.; Dang, H. V.; Amaya, M.; Person, A.; Broder, C. C.; Veesler, D. J.\nScore: 28.7, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554025\nLangya virus (LayV) is a recently discovered henipavirus (HNV), isolated from febrile patients in China, harboring a genome distantly related to that of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). HNV entry into host cells is mediated by the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins which are the main targets of neutralizing antibodies. We show here that the LayV F and G glycoproteins promote membrane fusion with human, mouse and hamster target cells using a different, yet unknown, receptor than NiV and HeV and that NiV- and HeV-elicited monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies do not cross-react with LayV F and G. We determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of LayV F, in the prefusion and postfusion states, and of LayV G, revealing previously unknown conformational landscapes and explaining their distinct antigenicity relative to NiV and HeV. We computationally designed stabilized LayV G constructs and demonstrate the generalizability of an HNV F prefusion-stabilization strategy which will expedite vaccine development efforts. Our data will support the development of vaccines and therapeutics against LayV and closely related HNVs, such as the monoclonal antibodies characterized here.\nAn ancestral dual function of OmpM as outer membrane tether and nutrient uptake channel in diderm Firmicutes\nAuthors: Silale, A.; Zhu, Y.; Witwinowski, J.; Smith, R. E.; Newman, K. E.; Bhamidimarri, S. P.; Basle, A.; Khalid, S.; BELOIN, C.; Gribaldo, S.; van den Berg, B.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.552755\nThe outer membrane (OM) in diderm, or Gram-negative, bacteria must be tethered to peptidoglycan (PG) for mechanical stability and to maintain cell morphology. Most diderm phyla from the Terrabacteria group lack well-characterised OM attachment systems such as Brauns lipoprotein, Pal and OmpA, but instead have the OmpM protein. OmpM has a periplasmic region containing an S-layer homology domain and a {beta}-barrel region that is embedded in the OM. Here, we have determined the structure of the most abundant OmpM protein from the diderm firmicute Veillonella parvula by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We reveal an OM portion similar to well-characterised trimeric general porins and a mobile periplasmic PG-binding region. Combining the cryo-EM data with crystal structures, structure predictions and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the periplasmic region of OmpM likely adopts multiple conformations. Single-channel electrophysiology demonstrates ion conductance properties similar to E. coli OmpF. Finally, we demonstrate via functional assays that the four OmpM paralogues are likely to be the only general porins in V. parvula. Together, our results show that OM tethering and nutrient acquisition are genetically linked in V. parvula (and other diderm Firmicutes), suggesting that concurrent loss of two key OM-related functions, tethering and nutrient uptake, promoted the multiple OM loss events that have been inferred in the Terrabacteria.\nSHRIMP: Genetically Encoded mScarlet-derived Red Fluorescent Hydrogen Peroxide Sensor with High Brightness and Minimal Photoactivation\nAuthors: Pang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Li, Z.; He, Y.; Wang, Y.; Oberholzer, J.; Ai, H.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552302\nRed fluorescent protein (RFP) derived indicators are popular due to advantages such as increased imaging depth and reduced autofluorescence and cytotoxicity. However, most RFP-based indicators have low brightness and are susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of existing red fluorescent indicators. We utilized mScarlet-I, a highly bright and robust monomeric RFP, to develop a circularly permuted variant called cpmScarlet. We further engineered cpmScarlet into a novel red fluorescent indicator specifically for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signaling and oxidative stress. The resultant indicator, SHRIMP (mScarlet-derived H2O2 Redox Indicator with Minimal Photoactivation), exhibited excitation and emission peaks at [~]570 and 595 nm, respectively, and demonstrated a maximum five-fold fluorescence turn-off response to H2O2. Importantly, SHRIMP was not susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation and showed high brightness both in its purified protein form and when expressed in mammalian cells. We successfully employed SHRIMP to visualize H2O2 dynamics in mammalian cells with exogenously added H2O2 and in activated macrophages. Additionally, we demonstrated its utility for multiparameter imaging by co-expressing SHRIMP with GCaMP6m, a green fluorescent calcium indicator, enabling simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and calcium dynamics in mammalian cells in response to thapsigargin (TG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, we expressed SHRIMP in isolated primary mouse islet tissue, and SHRIMP exhibited excellent brightness and capability for effective detection of H2O2 production during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced {beta}-cell damage. This study successfully transformed mScarlet-I, a bright and robust monomeric RFP, into a circularly permuted variant (cpmScarlet) and developed the first cpmScarlet-based genetically encoded fluorescent indicator called SHRIMP. SHRIMP exhibits high brightness and insensitivity to photoactivation and is a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of H2O2 dynamics in various biological systems. Further research may yield an expanded family of cpmScarlet-based red fluorescent indicators with enhanced photophysical properties.\nMicroglia mediate contact-independent neuronal pruning via secreted Neuraminidase-3 associated with extracellular vesicles\nAuthors: Delaveris, C. S.; Wang, C. L.; Riley, N. M.; Kulkarni, R. U.; Bertozzi, C. R.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554214\nNeurons communicate with each other through electrochemical transmission at synapses. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, can prune these synapses through a variety of contact-dependent and -independent means. Microglial secretion of active sialidase enzymes upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli is one unexplored mechanism of pruning. Recent work from our lab showed that treatment of neurons with bacterial sialidases disrupts neuronal network connectivity. Here, we find that activated microglia secrete Neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) associated with fusogenic extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we show Neu3 mediates contact-independent pruning of neurons and subsequent disruption of neuronal networks through neuronal glycocalyx remodeling. We observe that NEU3 is transcriptionally upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, and that a genetic knock-out of NEU3 abrogates the sialidase activity of inflammatory microglial secretions. Moreover, we demonstrate that Neu3 is associated with a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles, possibly exosomes, that are secreted by microglia upon inflammatory insult. Finally, we demonstrate that Neu3 is both necessary and sufficient to both desialylate neurons and decrease neuronal network connectivity. These results implicate Neu3 in remodeling of the glycocalyx leading to aberrant network-level activity of neurons, with implications in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.\nFucosylated glycoproteins and fucosylated glycolipids play opposing roles in cholera intoxication\nAuthors: Ghorashi, A. C.; Boucher, A.; Archer-hartmann, S. A.; Murray, N. B.; Konada, R. S. R.; Zhang, X.; Xing, C.; Azadi, P.; Yrlid, U.; Kohler, J. J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551727\nCholera toxin (CT) is the etiological agent of cholera. Here we report that multiple classes of fucosylated glycoconjugates function in CT binding and intoxication of intestinal epithelial cells. In Colo205 cells, knockout of B3GNT5, the enzyme required for synthesis of lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs), reduces CT binding but sensitizes cells to intoxication. Overexpressing B3GNT5 to generate more fucosylated GSLs confers protection against intoxication, indicating that fucosylated GSLs act as decoy receptors for CT. Knockout (KO) of B3GALT5 causes increased production of fucosylated O-linked and N-linked glycoproteins, and leads to increased CT binding and intoxication. Knockout of B3GNT5 in B3GALT5 KO cells eliminates production of fucosylated GSLs but increases intoxication, identifying fucosylated glycoproteins as functional receptors for CT. These findings provide insight into molecular determinants regulating CT sensitivity of host cells.\nBlocking oligomerization is the most viable strategy to inhibit STING\nAuthors: Chan, R. J. M.; Cao, X.; Ergun, S. L.; Njomen, E.; Lynch, S. R.; Cravatt, B. F.; Li, L.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553045\nAutoimmune disorders are frequently exacerbated by aberrant STING signaling. While STING inhibitors are highly sought after, no viable therapeutic strategies have been reported. When stimulated, STING undergoes a multi-step mechanism to activate downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including palmitoylation, translocation from the ER to the Golgi, and oligomerization, but it remains unclear which step(s) are strictly required and therefore should be targeted by potential STING inhibitors. Here, we comprehensively established the order and determined the necessity of each STING activation step. We find that ER-to-Golgi translocation is dispensable for downstream ISG activation, and a previously studied palmitoylation site, C91, is not required for activation in all contexts. Cysteine reactivity mapping and metabolic labeling identified a new palmitoylation site, C64, that is basally palmitoylated and required for STING activation, but is not druggable due to poor solvent accessibility. We confirm that the oligomerization step of STING activation is strictly required, and therefore developed a short peptide mimicking its natural autoinhibitory domain that effectively inhibits STING activation: a proof of concept for the first viable strategy for developing STING inhibitors.\nBacteriophage P22 SieA mediated superinfection exclusion\nAuthors: Leavitt, J. C.; Woodbury, B. M.; Gilcrease, E. B.; Bridges, C. M.; Teschke, C. M.; Casjens, S. R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553423\nMany temperate phages encode prophage-expressed functions that interfere with superinfection of the host bacterium by external phages. Salmonella phage P22 has four such systems that are expressed from the prophage in a lysogen that are encoded by the c2 (repressor), gtrABC, sieA, and sieB genes. Here we report that the P22-encoded SieA protein is the only phage protein required for exclusion by the SieA system, and that it is an inner membrane protein that blocks DNA injection by P22 and its relatives, but has no effect on infection by other tailed phage types. The P22 virion injects its DNA through the host cell membranes and periplasm via a conduit assembled from three \"ejection proteins\" after their release from the virion. Phage P22 mutants were isolated that overcome the SieA block, and they have amino acid changes in the C-terminal regions of the gene 16 and 20 encoded ejection proteins. Three different single amino acid changes in these proteins are required to obtain nearly full resistance to SieA. Hybrid P22 phages that have phage HK620 ejection protein genes are also partially resistant to SieA. There are three sequence types of extant phage-encoded SieA proteins that are less than 30% identical to one another, yet comparison of two of these types found no differences in target specificity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the inner membrane protein SieA interferes with the assembly or function of the periplasmic gp20 and membrane-bound gp16 DNA delivery conduit.

W.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551831\nThe Parkinsons-associated protein -synuclein (-syn) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which typically leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. The coincidence of LLPS and amyloid formation has complicated the identification of the molecular determinants unique to LLPS of -syn. Moreover, the lack of strategies to selectively perturb LLPS makes it difficult to dissect the biological roles specific to -syn LLPS, independent of fibrillation. Herein, using a combination of subtle missense mutations, we show that LLPS of -syn is highly sensitive to its sequence complexity. In fact, we find that even a highly conservative mutation (V16I) that increases sequence complexity without perturbing physicochemical and structural properties, is sufficient to reduce LLPS by 75%; this effect can be reversed by an adjacent V-to-I mutation (V15I) that restores the original sequence complexity. A18T, a complexity-enhancing PD-associated mutation, was likewise found to reduce LLPS, implicating sequence complexity in -syn pathogenicity. Furthermore, leveraging the differences in LLPS propensities among different -syn variants, we demonstrate that fibrillation of -syn does not necessarily correlate with its LLPS. In fact, we identify mutations that selectively perturb LLPS or fibrillation of -syn, unlike previously studied mutations. The variants and design principles reported herein should therefore empower future studies to disentangle these two phenomena and distinguish their (patho)biological roles.\nThermodynamic Coupling of the tandem RRM domains of hnRNP A1 underlie its Pleiotropic RNA Binding Functions\nAuthors: Levengood, J. D.; Potoyan, D.; Penumutchu, S.; Kumar, A.; Wang, Y.; Hansen, A. L.; Kutluay, S.; Roche, J.; Tolbert, B. S.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553700\nThe functional properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) require allosteric regulation through inter-domain communication. Despite the foundational importance of allostery to biological regulation, almost no studies have been conducted to describe the biophysical nature by which inter-domain communication manifests in RBPs. Here, we show through high-pressure studies with hnRNP A1 that inter-domain communication is vital for the unique stability of its N- terminal domain containing a tandem of RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs). Despite high sequence similarity and nearly identical tertiary structures, the two RRMs exhibit drastically different stability under pressure. RRM2 unfolds completely under high-pressure as an individual domain, but when appended to RRM1, it remains stable. Variants in which inter-domain communication is disrupted between the tandem RRMs show a large decrease in stability under pressure. Carrying these mutations over to the full-length protein for in vivo experiments revealed that the mutations affected the ability of the disordered C-terminus to engage in protein-protein interactions and more importantly, they also influenced the RNA binding capacity. Collectively, this work reveals that thermodynamic coupling between the tandem RRMs of hnRNP A1 accounts for its allosteric regulatory functions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Native mass spectrometry (native MS) is a powerful technique that provides information on stoichiometry, interactions, homogeneity and shape of protein complexes. However, the extent of deviation between protein structures in the mass spectrometer and in solution remains a matter of debate. Here, we uncover the gas-phase structure of {beta}-galactosidase using single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) down to 2.6 [A] resolution, enabled by soft-landing of mass-selected protein complexes onto cold TEM grids and in-situ ice coating. We find that large parts of the secondary and tertiary structure are retained from solution, with dehydration-driven subunit reorientation leading to consistent compaction in the gas phase. Our work enables visualizing the structure of gas-phase protein complexes from numerous experimental scenarios at side-chain resolution and demonstrates the possibility of more controlled cryo-EM sample preparation.

        <p class="abstract">Langya virus (LayV) is a recently discovered henipavirus (HNV), isolated from febrile patients in China, harboring a genome distantly related to that of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). HNV entry into host cells is mediated by the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins which are the main targets of neutralizing antibodies. We show here that the LayV F and G glycoproteins promote membrane fusion with human, mouse and hamster target cells using a different, yet unknown, receptor than NiV and HeV and that NiV- and HeV-elicited monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies do not cross-react with LayV F and G. We determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of LayV F, in the prefusion and postfusion states, and of LayV G, revealing previously unknown conformational landscapes and explaining their distinct antigenicity relative to NiV and HeV. We computationally designed stabilized LayV G constructs and demonstrate the generalizability of an HNV F prefusion-stabilization strategy which will expedite vaccine development efforts. Our data will support the development of vaccines and therapeutics against LayV and closely related HNVs, such as the monoclonal antibodies characterized here.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The outer membrane (OM) in diderm, or Gram-negative, bacteria must be tethered to peptidoglycan (PG) for mechanical stability and to maintain cell morphology. Most diderm phyla from the Terrabacteria group lack well-characterised OM attachment systems such as Brauns lipoprotein, Pal and OmpA, but instead have the OmpM protein. OmpM has a periplasmic region containing an S-layer homology domain and a {beta}-barrel region that is embedded in the OM. Here, we have determined the structure of the most abundant OmpM protein from the diderm firmicute Veillonella parvula by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We reveal an OM portion similar to well-characterised trimeric general porins and a mobile periplasmic PG-binding region. Combining the cryo-EM data with crystal structures, structure predictions and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the periplasmic region of OmpM likely adopts multiple conformations. Single-channel electrophysiology demonstrates ion conductance properties similar to E. coli OmpF. Finally, we demonstrate via functional assays that the four OmpM paralogues are likely to be the only general porins in V. parvula. Together, our results show that OM tethering and nutrient acquisition are genetically linked in V. parvula (and other diderm Firmicutes), suggesting that concurrent loss of two key OM-related functions, tethering and nutrient uptake, promoted the multiple OM loss events that have been inferred in the Terrabacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Red fluorescent protein (RFP) derived indicators are popular due to advantages such as increased imaging depth and reduced autofluorescence and cytotoxicity. However, most RFP-based indicators have low brightness and are susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of existing red fluorescent indicators. We utilized mScarlet-I, a highly bright and robust monomeric RFP, to develop a circularly permuted variant called cpmScarlet. We further engineered cpmScarlet into a novel red fluorescent indicator specifically for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signaling and oxidative stress. The resultant indicator, SHRIMP (mScarlet-derived H2O2 Redox Indicator with Minimal Photoactivation), exhibited excitation and emission peaks at [~]570 and 595 nm, respectively, and demonstrated a maximum five-fold fluorescence turn-off response to H2O2. Importantly, SHRIMP was not susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation and showed high brightness both in its purified protein form and when expressed in mammalian cells. We successfully employed SHRIMP to visualize H2O2 dynamics in mammalian cells with exogenously added H2O2 and in activated macrophages. Additionally, we demonstrated its utility for multiparameter imaging by co-expressing SHRIMP with GCaMP6m, a green fluorescent calcium indicator, enabling simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and calcium dynamics in mammalian cells in response to thapsigargin (TG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, we expressed SHRIMP in isolated primary mouse islet tissue, and SHRIMP exhibited excellent brightness and capability for effective detection of H2O2 production during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced {beta}-cell damage. This study successfully transformed mScarlet-I, a bright and robust monomeric RFP, into a circularly permuted variant (cpmScarlet) and developed the first cpmScarlet-based genetically encoded fluorescent indicator called SHRIMP. SHRIMP exhibits high brightness and insensitivity to photoactivation and is a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of H2O2 dynamics in various biological systems. Further research may yield an expanded family of cpmScarlet-based red fluorescent indicators with enhanced photophysical properties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical transmission at synapses. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, can prune these synapses through a variety of contact-dependent and -independent means. Microglial secretion of active sialidase enzymes upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli is one unexplored mechanism of pruning. Recent work from our lab showed that treatment of neurons with bacterial sialidases disrupts neuronal network connectivity. Here, we find that activated microglia secrete Neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) associated with fusogenic extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we show Neu3 mediates contact-independent pruning of neurons and subsequent disruption of neuronal networks through neuronal glycocalyx remodeling. We observe that NEU3 is transcriptionally upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, and that a genetic knock-out of NEU3 abrogates the sialidase activity of inflammatory microglial secretions. Moreover, we demonstrate that Neu3 is associated with a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles, possibly exosomes, that are secreted by microglia upon inflammatory insult. Finally, we demonstrate that Neu3 is both necessary and sufficient to both desialylate neurons and decrease neuronal network connectivity. These results implicate Neu3 in remodeling of the glycocalyx leading to aberrant network-level activity of neurons, with implications in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Parkinson&#39;s disease and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cholera toxin (CT) is the etiological agent of cholera. Here we report that multiple classes of fucosylated glycoconjugates function in CT binding and intoxication of intestinal epithelial cells. In Colo205 cells, knockout of B3GNT5, the enzyme required for synthesis of lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs), reduces CT binding but sensitizes cells to intoxication. Overexpressing B3GNT5 to generate more fucosylated GSLs confers protection against intoxication, indicating that fucosylated GSLs act as decoy receptors for CT. Knockout (KO) of B3GALT5 causes increased production of fucosylated O-linked and N-linked glycoproteins, and leads to increased CT binding and intoxication. Knockout of B3GNT5 in B3GALT5 KO cells eliminates production of fucosylated GSLs but increases intoxication, identifying fucosylated glycoproteins as functional receptors for CT. These findings provide insight into molecular determinants regulating CT sensitivity of host cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autoimmune disorders are frequently exacerbated by aberrant STING signaling. While STING inhibitors are highly sought after, no viable therapeutic strategies have been reported. When stimulated, STING undergoes a multi-step mechanism to activate downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including palmitoylation, translocation from the ER to the Golgi, and oligomerization, but it remains unclear which step(s) are strictly required and therefore should be targeted by potential STING inhibitors. Here, we comprehensively established the order and determined the necessity of each STING activation step. We find that ER-to-Golgi translocation is dispensable for downstream ISG activation, and a previously studied palmitoylation site, C91, is not required for activation in all contexts. Cysteine reactivity mapping and metabolic labeling identified a new palmitoylation site, C64, that is basally palmitoylated and required for STING activation, but is not druggable due to poor solvent accessibility. We confirm that the oligomerization step of STING activation is strictly required, and therefore developed a short peptide mimicking its natural autoinhibitory domain that effectively inhibits STING activation: a proof of concept for the first viable strategy for developing STING inhibitors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many temperate phages encode prophage-expressed functions that interfere with superinfection of the host bacterium by external phages. Salmonella phage P22 has four such systems that are expressed from the prophage in a lysogen that are encoded by the c2 (repressor), gtrABC, sieA, and sieB genes. Here we report that the P22-encoded SieA protein is the only phage protein required for exclusion by the SieA system, and that it is an inner membrane protein that blocks DNA injection by P22 and its relatives, but has no effect on infection by other tailed phage types. The P22 virion injects its DNA through the host cell membranes and periplasm via a conduit assembled from three &#34;ejection proteins&#34; after their release from the virion. Phage P22 mutants were isolated that overcome the SieA block, and they have amino acid changes in the C-terminal regions of the gene 16 and 20 encoded ejection proteins. Three different single amino acid changes in these proteins are required to obtain nearly full resistance to SieA. Hybrid P22 phages that have phage HK620 ejection protein genes are also partially resistant to SieA. There are three sequence types of extant phage-encoded SieA proteins that are less than 30% identical to one another, yet comparison of two of these types found no differences in target specificity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the inner membrane protein SieA interferes with the assembly or function of the periplasmic gp20 and membrane-bound gp16 DNA delivery conduit.

        <p class="abstract">The Parkinsons-associated protein -synuclein (-syn) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which typically leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. The coincidence of LLPS and amyloid formation has complicated the identification of the molecular determinants unique to LLPS of -syn. Moreover, the lack of strategies to selectively perturb LLPS makes it difficult to dissect the biological roles specific to -syn LLPS, independent of fibrillation. Herein, using a combination of subtle missense mutations, we show that LLPS of -syn is highly sensitive to its sequence complexity. In fact, we find that even a highly conservative mutation (V16I) that increases sequence complexity without perturbing physicochemical and structural properties, is sufficient to reduce LLPS by 75%; this effect can be reversed by an adjacent V-to-I mutation (V15I) that restores the original sequence complexity. A18T, a complexity-enhancing PD-associated mutation, was likewise found to reduce LLPS, implicating sequence complexity in -syn pathogenicity. Furthermore, leveraging the differences in LLPS propensities among different -syn variants, we demonstrate that fibrillation of -syn does not necessarily correlate with its LLPS. In fact, we identify mutations that selectively perturb LLPS or fibrillation of -syn, unlike previously studied mutations. The variants and design principles reported herein should therefore empower future studies to disentangle these two phenomena and distinguish their (patho)biological roles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The functional properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) require allosteric regulation through inter-domain communication. Despite the foundational importance of allostery to biological regulation, almost no studies have been conducted to describe the biophysical nature by which inter-domain communication manifests in RBPs. Here, we show through high-pressure studies with hnRNP A1 that inter-domain communication is vital for the unique stability of its N- terminal domain containing a tandem of RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs). Despite high sequence similarity and nearly identical tertiary structures, the two RRMs exhibit drastically different stability under pressure. RRM2 unfolds completely under high-pressure as an individual domain, but when appended to RRM1, it remains stable. Variants in which inter-domain communication is disrupted between the tandem RRMs show a large decrease in stability under pressure. Carrying these mutations over to the full-length protein for in vivo experiments revealed that the mutations affected the ability of the disordered C-terminus to engage in protein-protein interactions and more importantly, they also influenced the RNA binding capacity. Collectively, this work reveals that thermodynamic coupling between the tandem RRMs of hnRNP A1 accounts for its allosteric regulatory functions.</p>
