PARIS is a defense system, often encoded in viral genomes, that is composed of a 53 kDa ABC ATPase (AriA) and a 35 kDa TOPRIM nuclease (AriB). Here we show that AriA and AriB assemble into a 425 kDa supramolecular immune complex. We use cryo-EM to determine the structure of this complex which explains how six molecules of AriA assemble into a propeller-shaped scaffold that coordinates three subunits of AriB. ATP-dependent detection of foreign proteins triggers the release of AriB, which assembles into a homodimeric nuclease that blocks infection by cleaving the host tRNALys. Phage T5 subverts PARIS immunity through expression of a tRNALys variant that prevent PARIS-mediated cleavage, and thereby restores viral infection. Collectively, these data explain how AriA functions as an ATP-dependent sensor that detects viral proteins and activates the AriB toxin. PARIS is one of an emerging set of immune systems that form macromolecular complexes for the recognition of foreign proteins, rather than foreign nucleic acids.\nGenetically encoded tool for manipulation of Δ{Psi}m identifies the latter as the driver of integrative stress response induced by ATP Synthase dysfunction\nAuthors: Choe, M.; Titov, D. V.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573435\nMitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) is one of the key parameters controlling cellular bioenergetics. Investigation of the role of {Delta}{Psi}m in live cells is complicated by a lack of tools for its direct manipulation without off-target effects. Here, we adopted the uncoupling protein UCP1 from brown adipocytes as a genetically encoded tool for direct manipulation of {Delta}{Psi}m. We validated the ability of exogenously expressed UCP1 to induce uncoupled respiration and lower {Delta}{Psi}m in mammalian cells. UCP1 expression lowered {Delta}{Psi}m to the same extent as chemical uncouplers but did not inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting that it manipulates {Delta}{Psi}m without the off-target effects of chemical uncouplers. Using UCP1, we revealed that elevated {Delta}{Psi}m is the driver of the Integrated Stress Response induced by ATP synthase inhibition in mammalian cells.\nDirect interrogation of context-dependent GPCR activity with a universal biosensor platform\nAuthors: Janicot, R.; Maziarz, M.; Park, J.-C.; Luebbers, A.; Green, E.; Zhao, J.; Philibert, C. E.; Zhang, H.; Layne, M. D.; Wu, J. C.; Garcia-Marcos, M.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573921\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of druggable proteins in the human genome, but progress in understanding and targeting them is hindered by the lack of tools to reliably measure their nuanced behavior in physiologically-relevant contexts. Here, we developed a collection of compact ONE vector G-protein Optical (ONE-GO) biosensor constructs as a scalable platform that can be conveniently deployed to measure G-protein activation by virtually any GPCR with high fidelity even when expressed endogenously in primary cells. By characterizing dozens of GPCRs across many cell types like primary cardiovascular cells or neurons, we revealed new insights into the molecular basis for G-protein coupling selectivity of GPCRs, pharmacogenomic profiles of anti-psychotics on naturally-occurring GPCR variants, and G-protein subtype signaling bias by endogenous GPCRs depending on cell type or upon inducing disease-like states. In summary, this open-source platform makes the direct interrogation of context-dependent GPCR activity broadly accessible.\nA genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensor for visualization of acetyl-CoA in live cells\nAuthors: Smith, J. J.; Valentino, T. R.; Ablicki, A. H.; Banerjee, R.; Colligan, A. R.; Eckert, D. M.; Desjardins, G. A.; Diehl, K. L.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573774\nAcetyl-coenzyme A is a central metabolite that participates in many cellular pathways. Evidence suggests that acetyl-CoA production and consumption are highly compartmentalized in mammalian cells. Yet methods to measure acetyl-CoA in living cells are lacking. In this work, we engineer an acetyl-CoA biosensor from the bacterial protein PanZ and circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP). We biochemically characterize the sensor and demonstrate its selectivity for acetyl-CoA over other CoA species. We then deploy the biosensor in E. coli and HeLa cells to demonstrate its utility in living cells. In E. coli, we show that the biosensor enables detection of rapid changes in acetyl-CoA levels. In human cells, we show that the biosensor enables subcellular detection and reveals the compartmentalization of acetyl-CoA metabolism.\nStructure of a lasso peptide bound ETB receptor provides insights into the mechanism of GPCR inverse agonism\nAuthors: Shihoya, W.; Akasaka, H.; Jordan, P.

J.; Nureki, O.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573741\nLasso peptides exhibit a unique lariat-like knotted structure imparting exceptional stability and thus show promise as therapeutic agents that target cell-surface receptors. One such receptor is the human endothelin ETB receptor, which is implicated in challenging cancers with poor immunotherapy responsiveness. The Streptomyces-derived lasso peptide, RES-701-3, is a selective inhibitor for ETB and a compelling candidate for therapeutic development. However, meager production from a genetically recalcitrant host has limited further structure-activity relationship studies of this potent inhibitor. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of ETB receptor in both its apo form and complex with RES-701-3, facilitated by a calcineurin-fusion strategy. Hydrophobic interactions between RES-701-3 and the transmembrane region of the receptor, especially involving two tryptophan residues, play a crucial role in RES-701-3 binding. Furthermore, RES-701-3 prevents conformational changes associated with G-protein coupling, explaining its inverse agonist activity. A comparative analysis with other lasso peptides and their target proteins highlights the potential of lasso peptides as precise drug candidates for G-protein-coupled receptors. This structural insight into RES-701-3 binding to ETB receptor offers valuable information for the development of novel therapeutics targeting this receptor and provides a broader understanding of lasso peptide interactions with human cell-surface receptors.\nMicroED structure of the C11 cysteine protease Clostripain\nAuthors: Ruma, Y. N.; Bu, G.; Gonen, T.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574240\nClostripain secreted from Clostridium histolyticum is the founding member of the C11 family of Clan CD cysteine peptidases, which is an important group of peptidases secreted by numerous bacteria. Clostripain is an arginine specific endopeptidase. Because of its efficacy as a cysteine peptidase, it is widely used in laboratory settings. Despite its importance the structure of clostripain remains unsolved. Here we describe the first structure of an active form of C. histolyticum Clostripain determined at 3.6 Angstrom resolution using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). The structure was determined from a single nanocrystal after focused ion beam milling. The structure of Clostripain shows a typical Clan CD /{beta}/; sandwich architecture and the Cys231/His176 catalytic dyad in the active site. It has a large electronegative substrate binding pocket showing its ability to accommodate large and diverse substrates. A loop in the heavy chain formed between residues 452 to 457 is potentially important for substrate binding. In conclusion, this result demonstrates the importance of MicroED to determine the unknown structure of macromolecules such as Clostripain, which can be further used as a platform to study substrate binding and design of potential inhibitors against this class of peptidases.\nSpatially resolved quantification of oxygen consumption rate in ex vivo lymph node slices\nAuthors: Anbaei, P.; Stevens, M. G.; Ball, A. G.; Bullock, T. N. J.; Pompano, R. R.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573955\nCellular metabolism has been closely linked to activation state in cells of the immune system, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in particular serves as a valuable metric for assessing metabolic activity. Several oxygen sensing assays have been reported for cells in standard culture conditions. However, none have provided a spatially resolved, optical measurement of local oxygen consumption in intact tissue samples, making it challenging to understand regional dynamics of consumption. Therefore, here we established a system to monitor the rates of oxygen consumption in ex vivo tissue slices, using murine lymphoid tissue as a case study. By integrating an optical oxygen sensor into a sealed perfusion chamber and incorporating appropriate correction for photobleaching of the sensor and of tissue autofluorescence, we were able to visualize and quantify rates of oxygen consumption in tissue. This method revealed for the first time that the rate of oxygen consumption in naive lymphoid tissue was higher in the T cell region compared to the B cell and cortical regions. To validate the method, we measured OCR in the T cell regions of naive lymph node slices using the optical assay and estimated the consumption rate per cell. The predictions from the optical assay were similar to reported values and were not significantly different from those of the Seahorse metabolic assay, a gold standard method for measuring OCR in cell suspensions. Finally, we used this method to quantify the rate of onset of tissue hypoxia for lymph node slices cultured in a sealed chamber and showed that continuous perfusion was sufficient to maintain oxygenation. In summary, this work establishes a method to monitor oxygen consumption with regional resolution in intact tissue explants, suitable for future use to compare tissue culture conditions and responses to stimulation.

D.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573835\nBacteria and the viruses that infect them (bacteriophages or phages) are engaged in an evolutionary arms race that has resulted in the development of hundreds of bacterial defense systems and myriad phage-encoded counterdefenses1-5. While the mechanisms of many bacterial defense systems are known1, how these systems avoid toxicity outside infection yet activate quickly upon sensing phage infection is less well understood. Here, we show that the bacterial Phage Anti-Restriction-Induced System (PARIS) operates as a toxin-antitoxin system, in which the antitoxin AriA sequesters and inactivates the toxin AriB until triggered by the T7 phage counterdefense protein Ocr. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM), we show that AriA is structurally similar to dimeric SMC-family ATPases but assembles into a distinctive homohexameric complex through two distinct oligomerization interfaces. In the absence of infection, the AriA hexamer binds up to three monomers of AriB, maintaining them in an inactive state. Ocr binding to the AriA-AriB complex triggers rearrangement of the AriA hexamer, releasing AriB and allowing it to dimerize and activate. AriB is a toprim/OLD-family nuclease whose activation arrests cell growth and inhibits phage propagation by globally inhibiting protein translation. Collectively, our findings reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense system that evolved in response to a phage counterdefense protein, and highlight how an SMC-family ATPase has been adapted as a bacterial infection sensor.\nDe novo design of diverse small molecule binders and sensors using Shape Complementary Pseudocycles\nAuthors: An, L.; Said, M.; Tran, L.; Majumder, S.; Goreshnik, I.; Lee, G.

A.; Baker, D.\nScore: 47.1, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572602\nA general method for designing proteins to bind and sense any small molecule of interest would be widely useful. Due to the small number of atoms to interact with, binding to small molecules with high affinity requires highly shape complementary pockets, and transducing binding events into signals is challenging. Here we describe an integrated deep learning and energy based approach for designing high shape complementarity binders to small molecules that are poised for downstream sensing applications. We employ deep learning generated psuedocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central pockets; depending on the geometry of the structural unit and repeat number, these pockets span wide ranges of sizes and shapes. For a small molecule target of interest, we extensively sample high shape complementarity pseudocycles to generate large numbers of customized potential binding pockets; the ligand binding poses and the interacting interfaces are then optimized for high affinity binding. We computationally design binders to four diverse molecules, including for the first time polar flexible molecules such as methotrexate and thyroxine, which are expressed at high levels and have nanomolar affinities straight out of the computer. Co-crystal structures are nearly identical to the design models. Taking advantage of the modular repeating structure of pseudocycles and central location of the binding pockets, we constructed low noise nanopore sensors and chemically induced dimerization systems by splitting the binders into domains which assemble into the original pseudocycle pocket upon target molecule addition. One Sentence SummaryWe use a pseuodocycle-based shape complementarity optimizing approach to design nanomolar binders to diverse ligands, including the flexible and polar methotrexate and thyroxine, that can be directly converted into ligand-gated nanopores and chemically induced dimerization systems.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Viruses compete with each other for limited cellular resources, and some viruses deliver defense mechanisms that protect the host from competing genetic parasites. PARIS is a defense system, often encoded in viral genomes, that is composed of a 53 kDa ABC ATPase (AriA) and a 35 kDa TOPRIM nuclease (AriB). Here we show that AriA and AriB assemble into a 425 kDa supramolecular immune complex. We use cryo-EM to determine the structure of this complex which explains how six molecules of AriA assemble into a propeller-shaped scaffold that coordinates three subunits of AriB. ATP-dependent detection of foreign proteins triggers the release of AriB, which assembles into a homodimeric nuclease that blocks infection by cleaving the host tRNALys. Phage T5 subverts PARIS immunity through expression of a tRNALys variant that prevent PARIS-mediated cleavage, and thereby restores viral infection. Collectively, these data explain how AriA functions as an ATP-dependent sensor that detects viral proteins and activates the AriB toxin. PARIS is one of an emerging set of immune systems that form macromolecular complexes for the recognition of foreign proteins, rather than foreign nucleic acids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) is one of the key parameters controlling cellular bioenergetics. Investigation of the role of {Delta}{Psi}m in live cells is complicated by a lack of tools for its direct manipulation without off-target effects. Here, we adopted the uncoupling protein UCP1 from brown adipocytes as a genetically encoded tool for direct manipulation of {Delta}{Psi}m. We validated the ability of exogenously expressed UCP1 to induce uncoupled respiration and lower {Delta}{Psi}m in mammalian cells. UCP1 expression lowered {Delta}{Psi}m to the same extent as chemical uncouplers but did not inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting that it manipulates {Delta}{Psi}m without the off-target effects of chemical uncouplers. Using UCP1, we revealed that elevated {Delta}{Psi}m is the driver of the Integrated Stress Response induced by ATP synthase inhibition in mammalian cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of druggable proteins in the human genome, but progress in understanding and targeting them is hindered by the lack of tools to reliably measure their nuanced behavior in physiologically-relevant contexts. Here, we developed a collection of compact ONE vector G-protein Optical (ONE-GO) biosensor constructs as a scalable platform that can be conveniently deployed to measure G-protein activation by virtually any GPCR with high fidelity even when expressed endogenously in primary cells. By characterizing dozens of GPCRs across many cell types like primary cardiovascular cells or neurons, we revealed new insights into the molecular basis for G-protein coupling selectivity of GPCRs, pharmacogenomic profiles of anti-psychotics on naturally-occurring GPCR variants, and G-protein subtype signaling bias by endogenous GPCRs depending on cell type or upon inducing disease-like states. In summary, this open-source platform makes the direct interrogation of context-dependent GPCR activity broadly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acetyl-coenzyme A is a central metabolite that participates in many cellular pathways. Evidence suggests that acetyl-CoA production and consumption are highly compartmentalized in mammalian cells. Yet methods to measure acetyl-CoA in living cells are lacking. In this work, we engineer an acetyl-CoA biosensor from the bacterial protein PanZ and circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP). We biochemically characterize the sensor and demonstrate its selectivity for acetyl-CoA over other CoA species. We then deploy the biosensor in E. coli and HeLa cells to demonstrate its utility in living cells. In E. coli, we show that the biosensor enables detection of rapid changes in acetyl-CoA levels. In human cells, we show that the biosensor enables subcellular detection and reveals the compartmentalization of acetyl-CoA metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lasso peptides exhibit a unique lariat-like knotted structure imparting exceptional stability and thus show promise as therapeutic agents that target cell-surface receptors. One such receptor is the human endothelin ETB receptor, which is implicated in challenging cancers with poor immunotherapy responsiveness. The Streptomyces-derived lasso peptide, RES-701-3, is a selective inhibitor for ETB and a compelling candidate for therapeutic development. However, meager production from a genetically recalcitrant host has limited further structure-activity relationship studies of this potent inhibitor. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of ETB receptor in both its apo form and complex with RES-701-3, facilitated by a calcineurin-fusion strategy. Hydrophobic interactions between RES-701-3 and the transmembrane region of the receptor, especially involving two tryptophan residues, play a crucial role in RES-701-3 binding. Furthermore, RES-701-3 prevents conformational changes associated with G-protein coupling, explaining its inverse agonist activity. A comparative analysis with other lasso peptides and their target proteins highlights the potential of lasso peptides as precise drug candidates for G-protein-coupled receptors. This structural insight into RES-701-3 binding to ETB receptor offers valuable information for the development of novel therapeutics targeting this receptor and provides a broader understanding of lasso peptide interactions with human cell-surface receptors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clostripain secreted from Clostridium histolyticum is the founding member of the C11 family of Clan CD cysteine peptidases, which is an important group of peptidases secreted by numerous bacteria. Clostripain is an arginine specific endopeptidase. Because of its efficacy as a cysteine peptidase, it is widely used in laboratory settings. Despite its importance the structure of clostripain remains unsolved. Here we describe the first structure of an active form of C. histolyticum Clostripain determined at 3.6 Angstrom resolution using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). The structure was determined from a single nanocrystal after focused ion beam milling. The structure of Clostripain shows a typical Clan CD /{beta}/; sandwich architecture and the Cys231/His176 catalytic dyad in the active site. It has a large electronegative substrate binding pocket showing its ability to accommodate large and diverse substrates. A loop in the heavy chain formed between residues 452 to 457 is potentially important for substrate binding. In conclusion, this result demonstrates the importance of MicroED to determine the unknown structure of macromolecules such as Clostripain, which can be further used as a platform to study substrate binding and design of potential inhibitors against this class of peptidases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular metabolism has been closely linked to activation state in cells of the immune system, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in particular serves as a valuable metric for assessing metabolic activity. Several oxygen sensing assays have been reported for cells in standard culture conditions. However, none have provided a spatially resolved, optical measurement of local oxygen consumption in intact tissue samples, making it challenging to understand regional dynamics of consumption. Therefore, here we established a system to monitor the rates of oxygen consumption in ex vivo tissue slices, using murine lymphoid tissue as a case study. By integrating an optical oxygen sensor into a sealed perfusion chamber and incorporating appropriate correction for photobleaching of the sensor and of tissue autofluorescence, we were able to visualize and quantify rates of oxygen consumption in tissue. This method revealed for the first time that the rate of oxygen consumption in naive lymphoid tissue was higher in the T cell region compared to the B cell and cortical regions. To validate the method, we measured OCR in the T cell regions of naive lymph node slices using the optical assay and estimated the consumption rate per cell. The predictions from the optical assay were similar to reported values and were not significantly different from those of the Seahorse metabolic assay, a gold standard method for measuring OCR in cell suspensions. Finally, we used this method to quantify the rate of onset of tissue hypoxia for lymph node slices cultured in a sealed chamber and showed that continuous perfusion was sufficient to maintain oxygenation. In summary, this work establishes a method to monitor oxygen consumption with regional resolution in intact tissue explants, suitable for future use to compare tissue culture conditions and responses to stimulation.

        <p class="abstract">Mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack mitochondria, and thus exclusively rely on glycolysis to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during aging in vivo and during storage in vitro in the blood bank. Here we identify an association between blood donor age, sex, ethnicity and end of storage levels of glycolytic metabolites in 13,029 volunteers from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study. Associations were also observed to ancestry-specific genetic polymorphisms in regions coding for phosphofructokinase 1, platelet - which we detected in mature RBCs - hexokinase 1, and for the ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1 and 2 (CD38/BST1). Gene-metabolite associations were validated in fresh and stored RBCs from 525 Diversity Outbred mice, and via multi-omics characterization of 1,929 samples from 643 RBC units during storage. ATP levels, breakdown and deamination into hypoxanthine were associated with hemolysis in vitro and in vivo, both in healthy autologous transfusion recipients and in 4,700 heterologous critically ill patients.

        <p class="abstract">Bacteria and the viruses that infect them (bacteriophages or phages) are engaged in an evolutionary arms race that has resulted in the development of hundreds of bacterial defense systems and myriad phage-encoded counterdefenses1-5. While the mechanisms of many bacterial defense systems are known1, how these systems avoid toxicity outside infection yet activate quickly upon sensing phage infection is less well understood. Here, we show that the bacterial Phage Anti-Restriction-Induced System (PARIS) operates as a toxin-antitoxin system, in which the antitoxin AriA sequesters and inactivates the toxin AriB until triggered by the T7 phage counterdefense protein Ocr. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM), we show that AriA is structurally similar to dimeric SMC-family ATPases but assembles into a distinctive homohexameric complex through two distinct oligomerization interfaces. In the absence of infection, the AriA hexamer binds up to three monomers of AriB, maintaining them in an inactive state. Ocr binding to the AriA-AriB complex triggers rearrangement of the AriA hexamer, releasing AriB and allowing it to dimerize and activate. AriB is a toprim/OLD-family nuclease whose activation arrests cell growth and inhibits phage propagation by globally inhibiting protein translation. Collectively, our findings reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense system that evolved in response to a phage counterdefense protein, and highlight how an SMC-family ATPase has been adapted as a bacterial infection sensor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A general method for designing proteins to bind and sense any small molecule of interest would be widely useful. Due to the small number of atoms to interact with, binding to small molecules with high affinity requires highly shape complementary pockets, and transducing binding events into signals is challenging. Here we describe an integrated deep learning and energy based approach for designing high shape complementarity binders to small molecules that are poised for downstream sensing applications. We employ deep learning generated psuedocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central pockets; depending on the geometry of the structural unit and repeat number, these pockets span wide ranges of sizes and shapes. For a small molecule target of interest, we extensively sample high shape complementarity pseudocycles to generate large numbers of customized potential binding pockets; the ligand binding poses and the interacting interfaces are then optimized for high affinity binding. We computationally design binders to four diverse molecules, including for the first time polar flexible molecules such as methotrexate and thyroxine, which are expressed at high levels and have nanomolar affinities straight out of the computer. Co-crystal structures are nearly identical to the design models. Taking advantage of the modular repeating structure of pseudocycles and central location of the binding pockets, we constructed low noise nanopore sensors and chemically induced dimerization systems by splitting the binders into domains which assemble into the original pseudocycle pocket upon target molecule addition.

One Sentence SummaryWe use a pseuodocycle-based shape complementarity optimizing approach to design nanomolar binders to diverse ligands, including the flexible and polar methotrexate and thyroxine, that can be directly converted into ligand-gated nanopores and chemically induced dimerization systems.</p>
