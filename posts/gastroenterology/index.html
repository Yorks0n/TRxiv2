We investigated genetic variation in human Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (hCAZymes) genes in relation to the response to a FODMAP-lowering diet in the DOMINO study. Design: hCAZy polymorphism was studied in IBS patients from the dietary (FODMAP-lowering; N=196) and medication (otilonium bromide; N=54) arms of the DOMINO trial via targeted sequencing of 6 genes of interest (AMY2B, LCT, MGAM, MGAM2, SI and TREH). hCAZyme defective (hypomorphic) variants were identified via computational annotation using clinical pathogenicity classifiers. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression was used to test hCAZyme polymorphisms in cumulative analyses where IBS patients were stratified into carrier and non-carrier groups (collapsing all hCAZyme hypomorphic variants into a single bin). Quantitative analysis of hCAZyme variation was also performed, in which the number of hCAZyme genes affected by a hypomorphic variant was taken into account. Results: In the dietary arm, the number of hypomorphic hCAZyme genes positively correlated with treatment response rate (P=0.03, OR=1.51 [CI=0.99-2.32]). In the IBS-D group (N=55), hCAZyme carriers were six times more likely to respond to the diet than non-carriers (P=0.002, OR=6.33 [CI=1.83-24.77]). These trends were not observed in the medication arm. Conclusions: hCAZYme genetic variation may be relevant to the efficacy of a carbohydrate-lowering diet. This warrants additional testing and replication of findings, including mechanistic investigations of this phenomenon.

In a pilot study, we investigated longitudinal Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) therapy on the gut microbiota, metabolomic functioning, and clinical outcomes in people with CF (pwCF). Study designFaecal samples from 20 pwCF were acquired before and then following 3, 6, and 17+ months of ETI therapy. Samples were subjected to microbiota sequencing and targeted metabolomics to profile and quantify short-chain fatty acid composition. Ten healthy matched controls were included for comparison. Clinical data, including markers of intestinal function were integrated to investigate relationships. ResultsExtended ETI therapy increased core microbiota diversity and composition, which translated to gradual shifts in whole microbiota composition towards that observed in healthy controls. Despite becoming more similar over time, CF microbiota and functional metabolite compositions remained significantly different to healthy controls. Antibiotic treatment for pulmonary infection significantly explained a relatively large degree of variation within the whole microbiota and rarer satellite taxa. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different following ETI. ConclusionsA positive trajectory towards the microbiota observed in healthy controls was found. However, we posit that progression was predominately impeded by pulmonary antibiotics administration. We recommend future studies use integrated omics approaches within a combination of long-term longitudinal patient studies and model experimental systems. This will deepen our understanding of the impacts of CFTR modulator therapy and respiratory antibiotic interventions upon the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal pathophysiology in CF.\n",
