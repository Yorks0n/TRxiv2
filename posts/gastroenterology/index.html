Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that different plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering pathways have distinct effects on biliary cholesterol and thereby risk of gallstone disease. Methods: This Mendelian randomization (MR) study used data from the UK Biobank (30,547 gallstone disease cases/336,742 controls), FinnGen (34,461 cases/301,383 controls) and Biobank Japan (9,305 cases/168,253 controls). First, drug-target MR and colocalization analyses were performed to investigate plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies on gallstone disease. Second, clustered MR and pathway analyses were performed to identify distinct mechanisms underlying the association of plasma LDL-cholesterol with gallstone disease. Results: For a 1-standard deviation reduction in plasma LDL-cholesterol, genetic mimics of statins were associated with lower risk of gallstone disease (odds ratio 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.62, 0.83]) but PCSK9 inhibitors and mipomersen were associated with higher risk (1.11 [1.03, 1.19] and 1.23 [1.13, 1.35]). The association for statins was supported by colocalization (posterior probability 98.7%). Clustered MR analyses identified variant clusters showing opposing associations of plasma LDL-cholesterol with gallstone disease, with evidence for ancestry-and sex-specific associations. Among variants predicting lower plasma LDL-cholesterol, those associated with lower risk of gallstone disease were mapped to glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, while those associated with higher risk were mapped to pathways relating to plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodelling, and clearance and ATP-binding cassette transporters. Conclusions: Different plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering pathways may have opposing effects on risk of gallstone disease. Notably, statins may reduce risk of gallstone disease.\nReal World Experience and Clinical Utility of EsoGuard(R) - Interim Data from the Lucid Registry\nAuthors: Englehardt, R.; Samarasena, J. B.; Bildzukewicz, N. A.; Hamblin, R.; Lee, V. T.; Verma, S.; deGuzman, B. J.; Aklog, L.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296162\nBackground Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and guidelines exist for screening, surveillance, and treatment. However, historically most high-risk individuals have not been reliably screened, likely due to a combination of factors associated with patient/physician awareness and use of upper endoscopy (UE) as the traditional screening test. EsoGuard(R) (EG) is a DNA biomarker assay, and EsoCheck(R) (EC) is a non-invasive, swallowable capsule device designed to collect cells from a targeted region of the esophagus. EG and EC in combination offers a well-tolerated, accessible, in-office triage test to improve detection of BE in patients with multiple risk factors. The Lucid Registry captures real-world data from the commercial use of EC with EG, and we present an interim review of clinical utility data from the first 517 enrolled subjects. Methods Multicenter, prospective, registry designed to capture data from patients undergoing EC cell collection and EG testing in the commercial setting. Data collection consists of demographics, risk factors, test results, provider management, and early clinical outcomes (through a maximum of four months post-EG). This data snapshot includes subjects enrolled from the start of the registry (April 14, 2023), through August 16, 2023. The primary assessment of clinical utility was agreement between EG assay results and physicians' decision on whether to refer the patient for subsequent UE. The relationship between BE/EAC risk factors and EG positivity rates was assessed. Results Among 517 subjects enrolled, average age was 47.9{+/-}14.3 years, 47.2% had history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and 63.8% had a minimum of 3 established BE risk factors (i.e., met American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) criteria for screening). 58.8% of subjects were firefighters; when firefighting i.e., occupational exposure to smoke and carcinogens is treated as an additional BE/EAC risk factor (+) those of the AGA, 81.2% of the study population had [\u0026ge;]3 risks, making up the \"AGA(+)\" cohort. EG positivity was 14.1%. 437 subjects contributed data for the clinical utility endpoint: agreement between positive EG results and subsequent referral for UE was 100%; agreement between negative EG results and non-referral for UE was 99.4%; concordance between EG results and UE referral decisions was 97.9%. These findings were comparable between the AGA and AGA(+) cohorts. Conclusions Experience from the Lucid Registry demonstrates that physicians who have adopted EC/EG in the commercial setting are reliably utilizing EG as a triage test to inform decision making on which patients to refer for further endoscopic evaluation of BE.\nGeneral purpose large language models match human performance on gastroenterology board exam self-assessments.\nAuthors: Ali, S.; Shahab, O.; Al Shabeeb, R.; Ladak, F.; Yang, J. O.; Nadkarni, G.; Echavarria, J.; Babar, S.; Shaukat, A.; Soroush, A.; El Kurdi, B.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295918\nIntroductionWhile general-purpose large language models(LLMs) were able to pass USMLE-style examinations, their ability to perform in a specialized context, like gastroenterology, is unclear. In this study, we assessed the performance of three widely available LLMs: PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the most recent ACG self-assessment(2022), utilizing both a basic and a prompt-engineered technique. MethodsWe interacted with the chat interfaces of PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We first applied a basic prompt approach, providing each exam question and answer text with minimalist text descriptions of any images. For the engineered approach, we added additional context and instructions. We assessed each model-prompt combination in terms of overall and difficulty-stratified performance and compared this to average human performance. We also evaluated each models self-assessed uncertainty. The highest scoring model-prompt combination was further assessed on the 2021 exam. We also assessed the impact of image descriptions on our findings. ResultsUsing a basic prompt, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 achieved scores of 32.6%, 55.3%, and 68.9% respectively. With the engineered prompt, scores improved to 42.7%, 65.2%, and 76.3% respectively. Testing GPT-4 on the ACG-2021 exam yielded a similar score(75.3%). GPT-4 scores matched the average score for human test-takers reported by ACG(75.7%). GPT-4 showed a capability to self-assess its confidence accurately in the context of a multiple-choice exam with its confidence estimates falling within 5% of its actual performance. Excluding image-based questions didnt change the primary findings. DiscussionOur study highlights the capability of GPT-4 to answer subspecialty board-exam questions at a level commensurate with the average human test-taker. The results confirm that prompt-engineering can enhance LLMs performance on medical reasoning tasks. We also show GPT-4 can provide insightful measures of uncertainty in the setting of board-style multiple-choice questions, alerting users to low-quality answers. Future studies of LLMs in gastroenterology should incorporate prompt-engineering to maximize model capabilities. WHAT IS KNOWNO_LIState of the Art large language models like GPT-4 and PaLM-Med 2 have achieved above average performance on USMLE board examinations. C_LIO_LIIn a previous study using basic model prompt instructions, GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 did not pass the 2021 and 2022 ACG self-assessment exams. C_LI WHAT IS NEW HEREO_LIOptimizing large language model prompt instructions improved the performance of chat-based GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM 2 on the ACG self-assessment exams. C_LIO_LIWith optimized prompt instructions, chat-based GPT-4 performed at the level of average human test takers on ACG-self assessment examinations and achieved a passing score. C_LIO_LIChat-based GPT-4 self-reported confidence levels correlated with correct answer rates on the ACG-self assessment examinations. C_LI\n",

However, historically most high-risk individuals have not been reliably screened, likely due to a combination of factors associated with patient/physician awareness and use of upper endoscopy (UE) as the traditional screening test. EsoGuard(R) (EG) is a DNA biomarker assay, and EsoCheck(R) (EC) is a non-invasive, swallowable capsule device designed to collect cells from a targeted region of the esophagus. EG and EC in combination offers a well-tolerated, accessible, in-office triage test to improve detection of BE in patients with multiple risk factors. The Lucid Registry captures real-world data from the commercial use of EC with EG, and we present an interim review of clinical utility data from the first 517 enrolled subjects. Methods Multicenter, prospective, registry designed to capture data from patients undergoing EC cell collection and EG testing in the commercial setting. Data collection consists of demographics, risk factors, test results, provider management, and early clinical outcomes (through a maximum of four months post-EG). This data snapshot includes subjects enrolled from the start of the registry (April 14, 2023), through August 16, 2023. The primary assessment of clinical utility was agreement between EG assay results and physicians&#39; decision on whether to refer the patient for subsequent UE. The relationship between BE/EAC risk factors and EG positivity rates was assessed. Results Among 517 subjects enrolled, average age was 47.9{&#43;/-}14.3 years, 47.2% had history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and 63.8% had a minimum of 3 established BE risk factors (i.e., met American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) criteria for screening). 58.8% of subjects were firefighters; when firefighting i.e., occupational exposure to smoke and carcinogens is treated as an additional BE/EAC risk factor (&#43;) those of the AGA, 81.2% of the study population had [&amp;ge;]3 risks, making up the &#34;AGA(&#43;)&#34; cohort. EG positivity was 14.1%. 437 subjects contributed data for the clinical utility endpoint: agreement between positive EG results and subsequent referral for UE was 100%; agreement between negative EG results and non-referral for UE was 99.4%; concordance between EG results and UE referral decisions was 97.9%. These findings were comparable between the AGA and AGA(&#43;) cohorts. Conclusions Experience from the Lucid Registry demonstrates that physicians who have adopted EC/EG in the commercial setting are reliably utilizing EG as a triage test to inform decision making on which patients to refer for further endoscopic evaluation of BE.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWhile general-purpose large language models(LLMs) were able to pass USMLE-style examinations, their ability to perform in a specialized context, like gastroenterology, is unclear. In this study, we assessed the performance of three widely available LLMs: PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the most recent ACG self-assessment(2022), utilizing both a basic and a prompt-engineered technique.

MethodsWe interacted with the chat interfaces of PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We first applied a basic prompt approach, providing each exam question and answer text with minimalist text descriptions of any images. For the engineered approach, we added additional context and instructions. We assessed each model-prompt combination in terms of overall and difficulty-stratified performance and compared this to average human performance. We also evaluated each models self-assessed uncertainty. The highest scoring model-prompt combination was further assessed on the 2021 exam. We also assessed the impact of image descriptions on our findings.

ResultsUsing a basic prompt, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 achieved scores of 32.6%, 55.3%, and 68.9% respectively. With the engineered prompt, scores improved to 42.7%, 65.2%, and 76.3% respectively. Testing GPT-4 on the ACG-2021 exam yielded a similar score(75.3%). GPT-4 scores matched the average score for human test-takers reported by ACG(75.7%). GPT-4 showed a capability to self-assess its confidence accurately in the context of a multiple-choice exam with its confidence estimates falling within 5% of its actual performance. Excluding image-based questions didnt change the primary findings.

DiscussionOur study highlights the capability of GPT-4 to answer subspecialty board-exam questions at a level commensurate with the average human test-taker. The results confirm that prompt-engineering can enhance LLMs performance on medical reasoning tasks. We also show GPT-4 can provide insightful measures of uncertainty in the setting of board-style multiple-choice questions, alerting users to low-quality answers. Future studies of LLMs in gastroenterology should incorporate prompt-engineering to maximize model capabilities.

WHAT IS KNOWNO_LIState of the Art large language models like GPT-4 and PaLM-Med 2 have achieved above average performance on USMLE board examinations.
C_LIO_LIIn a previous study using basic model prompt instructions, GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 did not pass the 2021 and 2022 ACG self-assessment exams.
