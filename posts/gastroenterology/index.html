S.; Lee, V. T.; deGuzman, B. J.; Verma, S.; Aklog, L.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294916\nBackground: Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly lethal malignancy which has had increasing incidence in Western populations over the last 40 years. Recommendations are for endoscopic screening of patients with multiple risk factors for BE, however most eligible patients are not undergoing such evaluation, or failing to be referred, leading to most patients with EAC being diagnosed without an existing BE diagnosis. EsoGuard (EG) is a commercially available biomarker test for detection of BE, and when used to analyze cells collected non-endoscopically with EsoCheck (EC), may serve as an easily accessible and well-tolerated diagnostic tool that has been recognized by the ACG and AGA as a reasonable alternative to screening endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of EG as a triage test for upper endoscopy in the diagnose BE in real world use. Methods: We present the first data snapshot from a multi-center, observational trial evaluating the CLinical Utility of EsoGuard (CLUE) among physicians who have adopted the technology into their clinical practice. At the time of data snapshot, four centers had contributed to enrollment of 275 subjects between February 23, 2023, to July 28, 2023. Participating centers followed their own standard practices for determining whom to test with EG on cells collected with EC and subsequent management of the patient following results. Demographics, risk factors, test results, and subsequent management decisions were collected and analyzed. The clinical utility of the technology was evaluated based on the impact of the EG test results on the ordering physician's decision to refer or not refer a patient for further endoscopic evaluation. Results: Among 275 subjects contributing data for analysis, the average age was 61.9 years, and there was a similar distribution among males and females. Eighty-nine-point seven percent (89.7%) reported a history of chronic GERD, and 73.8% had GERD plus an additional 3 BE risk factors (i.e., ACG screening cohort). 232 subjects had EG results documented at the time of data analysis, among which 229 also had a physician decision on endoscopy referral. Total EG positivity rate was 29.3% (68/232) and 65.5% (152/232) were negative; the positive agreement between positive EG results and referral for endoscopy was 100%. The negative agreement between a negative EG result and non-referral for endoscopy was 99.3%. The overall concordance between EG result and endoscopy referral was 98.8%. This did not substantially differ between the ACG screening cohort compared to others. Conclusions: Data from the first snapshot of the CLUE study demonstrates physicians ordering EC/EG in the commercial setting are reliably utilizing EG results as a triage tool to guide referrals for endoscopic evaluation of BE. Physicians always refer EG(+) individual for additional endoscopic evaluation, whereas EG(-) subjects are consistently being spared an invasive test.\nClinical Utility of EsoGuard as a Triage Test for Endoscopy to Identify Barrett's Esophagus in Fire Fighters\nAuthors: Hamblin, R.; Lee, V. T.; deGuzman, B. J.; Verma, S.; Aklog, L.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294176\nBackgroundFirefighters have frequent exposure to smoke and compounds that have been shown to increase the risk of developing esophageal neoplasia. EsoGuard(R) is a DNA biomarker assay that can be utilized with efficiency and high tolerability as a triage test in the diagnosis of patients with Barretts Esophagus (BE) and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in this population. MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical utility data on use of EsoGuard(R) DNA testing on samples collected with the nonendoscopic esophageal cell collection device, EsoCheck(R), during two large cancer screening events for firefighters in San Antonio, TX, in January 2023. ResultsA total of 388 firefighters volunteered for screening of Barretts Esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, of which 385 (\u003e99%) successfully provided cell samples for EsoGuard analysis. There was a 7.27% (28/385) positivity rate, which was similar among males and females (7.26% and 7.41%, respectively). Only 13/385 (3.37%) tests failed analysis due to insufficient DNA sampling. Among those who tested positive with EsoGuard, 100% (28/28) were referred by the ordering physician for gastroenterology and upper endoscopy evaluation. Among those who tested negative, none were referred for upper endoscopy evaluation. This resulted in a 100% concordance between EsoGuard results and physician management decisions. ConclusionsThis study capturing real-world data on the use of EsoGuard for early detection of BE/EAC in firefighters demonstrates the ability of this diagnostic tool to efficiently screen high-risk populations in a manner that is well tolerated, has high result yield, and effectively drives physician management decisions.\nA comparison of large language model versus manual chart review for extraction of data elements from the electronic health record\nAuthors: Ge, J.; Li, M.; Delk, M. B.; Lai, J. C.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294924\nImportance: Large language models (LLMs) have proven useful for extracting data from publicly available sources, but their uses in clinical settings and with clinical data are unknown. Objective: To determine the accuracy of data extraction using \"Versa Chat,\" a chat implementation of the general-purpose OpenAI gpt-35-turbo LLM model, versus manual chart review for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imaging reports. Design: We engineered a prompt for the data extraction task of six distinct data elements and input 192 abdominal imaging reports that were also manually tagged. We evaluated performance by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Setting/Participants: Cross-sectional abdominal imaging reports of patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma enrolled in the Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation (FrAILT) study.\nReducing diagnostic delays in Acute Hepatic Porphyria using electronic health records data and machine learning: a multicenter development and validation study\nAuthors: Bhasuran, B.; Schmolly, K.; Kapoor, Y.; Jayakumar, N.; Doan, R.; Amin, J.; Meninger, S.; Cheng, N.; Deering, R.; Anderson, K.; Beaven, S.; Wang, B.; Rudrapatna, V. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23293130\nImportanceAcute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP) is a group of rare but treatable conditions associated with diagnostic delays of fifteen years on average. The advent of electronic health records (EHR) data and machine learning (ML) may improve the timely recognition of rare diseases like AHP. However, prediction models can be difficult to train given the limited case numbers, unstructured EHR data, and selection biases intrinsic to healthcare delivery. ObjectiveTo train and characterize models for identifying patients with AHP. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis diagnostic study used structured and notes-based EHR data from two centers at the University of California, UCSF (2012-2022) and UCLA (2019-2022). The data were split into two cohorts (referral, diagnosis) and used to develop models that predict: 1) who will be referred for testing of acute porphyria, amongst those who presented with abdominal pain (a cardinal symptom of AHP), and 2) who will test positive, amongst those referred. The referral cohort consisted of 747 patients referred for testing and 99,849 contemporaneous patients who were not. The diagnosis cohort consisted of 72 confirmed AHP cases and 347 patients who tested negative. Cases were female predominant and 6-75 years old at the time of diagnosis. Candidate models used a range of architectures. Feature selection was semi-automated and incorporated publicly available data from knowledge graphs. Main Outcomes and MeasuresF-score on an outcome-stratified test set ResultsThe best center-specific referral models achieved an F-score of 86-91%. The best diagnosis model achieved an F-score of 92%. To further test our model, we contacted 372 current patients who lack an AHP diagnosis but were predicted by our models as potentially having it ([\u0026ge;] 10% probability of referral, [\u0026ge;] 50% of testing positive). However, we were only able to recruit 10 of these patients for biochemical testing, all of whom were negative. Nonetheless, post hoc evaluations suggested that these models could identify 71% of cases earlier than their diagnosis date, saving 1.2 years. Conclusions and RelevanceML can reduce diagnostic delays in AHP and other rare diseases. Robust recruitment strategies and multicenter coordination will be needed to validate these models before they can be deployed. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning help identify undiagnosed patients with Acute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP), a group of rare diseases? FindingsUsing electronic health records (EHR) data from two centers we developed models to predict: 1) who will be referred for AHP testing, and 2) who will test positive. The best models achieved 89-93% accuracy on the test set. These models appeared capable of recognizing 71% of the cases earlier than their true diagnosis date, reducing diagnostic delays by an average of 1.2 years. MeaningMachine learning models trained using EHR data can help reduce diagnostic delays in rare diseases like AHP.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFirefighters have frequent exposure to smoke and compounds that have been shown to increase the risk of developing esophageal neoplasia. EsoGuard(R) is a DNA biomarker assay that can be utilized with efficiency and high tolerability as a triage test in the diagnosis of patients with Barretts Esophagus (BE) and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in this population.

MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical utility data on use of EsoGuard(R) DNA testing on samples collected with the nonendoscopic esophageal cell collection device, EsoCheck(R), during two large cancer screening events for firefighters in San Antonio, TX, in January 2023.

ResultsA total of 388 firefighters volunteered for screening of Barretts Esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, of which 385 (&gt;99%) successfully provided cell samples for EsoGuard analysis. There was a 7.27% (28/385) positivity rate, which was similar among males and females (7.26% and 7.41%, respectively). Only 13/385 (3.37%) tests failed analysis due to insufficient DNA sampling. Among those who tested positive with EsoGuard, 100% (28/28) were referred by the ordering physician for gastroenterology and upper endoscopy evaluation. Among those who tested negative, none were referred for upper endoscopy evaluation. This resulted in a 100% concordance between EsoGuard results and physician management decisions.

ConclusionsThis study capturing real-world data on the use of EsoGuard for early detection of BE/EAC in firefighters demonstrates the ability of this diagnostic tool to efficiently screen high-risk populations in a manner that is well tolerated, has high result yield, and effectively drives physician management decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceAcute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP) is a group of rare but treatable conditions associated with diagnostic delays of fifteen years on average. The advent of electronic health records (EHR) data and machine learning (ML) may improve the timely recognition of rare diseases like AHP. However, prediction models can be difficult to train given the limited case numbers, unstructured EHR data, and selection biases intrinsic to healthcare delivery.

ObjectiveTo train and characterize models for identifying patients with AHP.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis diagnostic study used structured and notes-based EHR data from two centers at the University of California, UCSF (2012-2022) and UCLA (2019-2022). The data were split into two cohorts (referral, diagnosis) and used to develop models that predict: 1) who will be referred for testing of acute porphyria, amongst those who presented with abdominal pain (a cardinal symptom of AHP), and 2) who will test positive, amongst those referred. The referral cohort consisted of 747 patients referred for testing and 99,849 contemporaneous patients who were not. The diagnosis cohort consisted of 72 confirmed AHP cases and 347 patients who tested negative. Cases were female predominant and 6-75 years old at the time of diagnosis.

Candidate models used a range of architectures. Feature selection was semi-automated and incorporated publicly available data from knowledge graphs.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresF-score on an outcome-stratified test set

ResultsThe best center-specific referral models achieved an F-score of 86-91%. The best diagnosis model achieved an F-score of 92%. To further test our model, we contacted 372 current patients who lack an AHP diagnosis but were predicted by our models as potentially having it ([&amp;ge;] 10% probability of referral, [&amp;ge;] 50% of testing positive). However, we were only able to recruit 10 of these patients for biochemical testing, all of whom were negative. Nonetheless, post hoc evaluations suggested that these models could identify 71% of cases earlier than their diagnosis date, saving 1.2 years.

Conclusions and RelevanceML can reduce diagnostic delays in AHP and other rare diseases. Robust recruitment strategies and multicenter coordination will be needed to validate these models before they can be deployed.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan machine learning help identify undiagnosed patients with Acute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP), a group of rare diseases?

FindingsUsing electronic health records (EHR) data from two centers we developed models to predict: 1) who will be referred for AHP testing, and 2) who will test positive. The best models achieved 89-93% accuracy on the test set. These models appeared capable of recognizing 71% of the cases earlier than their true diagnosis date, reducing diagnostic delays by an average of 1.2 years.

MeaningMachine learning models trained using EHR data can help reduce diagnostic delays in rare diseases like AHP.</p>
