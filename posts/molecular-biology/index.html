R.\nScore: 87.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555033\nIn healthy individuals, physical exercise improves cardiovascular health and muscle strength, alleviates fatigue, and reduces risk of chronic diseases. Although exercise is suggested as a lifestyle intervention to manage various chronic illnesses, it negatively affects people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), who suffer from exercise intolerance. We hypothesized that altered extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling in ME/CFS patients after an exercise challenge may contribute to their prolonged and exacerbated negative response to exertion (post-exertional malaise). EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from the plasma of 18 female ME/CFS patients and 17 age- and BMI-matched female sedentary controls at three time points: before, 15 minutes, and 24 hours after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis and their protein cargo was quantified using Tandem Mass Tag-based (TMT) proteomics. The results show that exercise affects the EV proteome in ME/CFS patients differently than in healthy individuals and that changes in EV proteins after exercise are strongly correlated with symptom severity in ME/CFS. Differentially abundant proteins in ME/CFS patients vs. controls were involved in many pathways and systems, including coagulation processes, muscle contraction (both smooth and skeletal muscle), cytoskeletal proteins, the immune system, and brain signaling.\nRepair of CRISPR-guided RNA breaks enables site-specific RNA editing in human cells.\nAuthors: Nemudraia, A.; Nemudryi, A. A.; Wiedenheft, B.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555404\nGenome editing with CRISPR RNA-guided endonucleases generates DNA breaks that are resolved by cellular DNA repair machinery. However, analogous methods to manipulate RNA remain unavailable. Here, we show that site-specific RNA breaks generated with RNA-targeting CRISPR complexes are repaired in human cells, and this repair can be used for programmable deletions in human transcripts that restore gene function. Collectively, this work establishes a technology for precise RNA manipulation with potential therapeutic applications. One-Sentence SummaryCRISPR-guided RNA breaks are repaired in human cells, and this RNA repair can be used for programmable editing of human transcriptomes.\nCoSMIC - A hybrid approach for large-scale, high-resolution microbial profiling of novel niches\nAuthors: Knafo, M.; Rezenman, S.; Idan, T.; Elgart, M.; Dagan, S.; Reich, Z.; Kapon, R.; Sade, D.; Shental, N.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556087\nMicrobiome studies have become integral to a wide range of biological research from ecology to oncology, mainly relying on short-read sequencing of variable regions along the 16S rRNA gene. However, the comprehensiveness of 16S rRNA studies has been persistently challenged due to a lack of primer universality and primer biases, causing differences between a study's results and the underlying bacterial community. Moreover, relying on a small part of the gene often provides low phylogenetic resolution, hampering downstream taxonomy-based analysis and the ability to harmonize results from studies performed using different variable regions. Here, we introduce a framework called 'Comprehensive Small Ribosomal Subunit Mapping and Identification of Communities' (CoSMIC), effectively addressing these challenges. CoSMIC begins with long-read full-length sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, using Locked Nucleic Acid primers over pooled samples. This step augments the Small Subunit (SSU) reference database with novel niche-specific SSUs. Subsequently, CoSMIC optimizes a set of primer pairs targeting multiple non-consecutive variable regions along the gene, followed by standard short-read sequencing of each sample. Data from different regions are seamlessly integrated using the SMURF framework, thus alleviating primer-based biases and providing extremely high phylogenetic resolution. We evaluated CoSMIC across plant, root, soil and marine sponge samples, yielding higher profiling accuracy and unprecedented phylogenetic resolution compared to standard methods while detecting ~40,000 novel SSUs. CoSMIC provides researchers with a robust, customizable, and cost-effective framework addressing the challenges of 16S rRNA sequencing, especially in underexplored habitats, paving the way for data harmonization across microbiome studies.\nA Toxoplasma gondii putative arginine transporter localizes to the plant-like vacuolar compartment and controls parasite extracellular survival and stage differentiation\nAuthors: Piro, F.; Masci, S.; Kannan, G.; Focaia, R.; Schultz, T. L.; Carruthers, V. B.; Di Cristina, M.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555807\nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects a broad spectrum of hosts and can colonize many organs and cell types. The ability to reside within a wide range of different niches requires substantial adaptability to diverse microenvironments. Very little is known about how this parasite senses various milieus and adapts its metabolism to survive, replicate during the acute stage, and then differentiate to the chronic stage. Most eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals, rely on a nutrient sensing machinery involving the TORC complex as master regulator of cell growth and cell cycle progression. The lysosome functions as a signaling hub where TORC complex assembles and is activated by transceptors, which both sense and transport amino acids, including the arginine transceptor SLC38A9. While most of the TORC components are lost in T. gondii, indicating the evolution of a distinct nutrient sensing mechanism, the parasites lysosomal plant-like vacuolar compartment (PLVAC) may still serve as a sensory platform for controlling parasite growth and differentiation. Using SLC38A9 to query the T. gondii proteome, we identified four putative amino acid transporters, termed TgAAT1-4, that structurally resemble the SLC38A9 arginine transceptor. Assessing their expression and sub-cellular localization, we found that one of them, TgAAT1, localized to the PLVAC and is necessary for normal parasite extracellular survival and bradyzoite differentiation. Moreover, we show that TgAAT1 is involved in the PLVAC efflux of arginine, an amino acid playing a key role in T. gondii differentiation, further supporting the hypothesis that TgAAT1 might play a role in nutrient sensing.\nPatchy and widespread distribution of bacterial translation arrest peptides associated with the protein localization machinery\nAuthors: Fujiwara, K.; Tsuji, N.; Yoshida, M.; Takada, H.; Chiba, S.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556018\nRegulatory arrest peptides exert cellular functions via mechanisms involving regulated translational arrest. Monitoring substrates, a class of arrest peptides, feedback-regulate the expression of the Sec or YidC protein localization machinery. Previously, only a limited number of monitoring substrates were identified. In this study, we performed a bacterial domain-wide search, followed by in vivo and in vitro analyses, leading to a comprehensive identification of many novel Sec/YidC-related arrest peptides that showed patchy, but widespread, phylogenetic distribution throughout the bacterial domain. Identification of five novel arrest-inducing sequences suggests that bacteria have evolved various arrest-inducing mechanisms. We also identified many arrest peptides that share an R-A-P-P like sequence, suggesting that this sequence could serve as a common evolutionary seed that could overcome the species-specific structures of ribosomes, to evolve arrest peptides. Our comprehensive phylogenetic study revealed that arrest peptide is a prevalent mechanism for the gene regulation of the protein localization machinery.\nA Small Tau Fragment Specifically Templates Four Repeat Tau Aggregates Through Multiple Generations\nAuthors: Longhini, A. P.; DuBose, A.; Lobo, S.; Vijayan, V.; Bai, Y.; Keane, E.; Sala-Jarque, J.; Nikitina, A.; Carrettiero, D.; Unger, M.; Sclafani, O.; Fu, V.; Vigers, M.; Buee, L.; Landrieu, I.; Shell, S.; Shea, J. E.; Han, S.; Kosik, K. S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555649\nPrion-like spread of disease-specific tau conformers is a hallmark of all tauopathies. We used a 19-residue probe peptide spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau to induce aggregation specifically of 4R, but not 3R tau. The aggregates can propagate as isoform-specific seeds over multiple generations, have a high {beta}-sheet content, a lipid signal, and resemble the PSP cryo-EM fold. A simulation of peptide free energy landscapes pinpointed the features of the hairpin structure uniquely found in the cryo-EM structures of pure 4R tauopathies and captured in the peptide. These molecular dynamic simulations were experimentally validated by the S305K substitution in 4R tau, corresponding to the position found in 3R tau. This single amino acid substitution prevented tau aggregates induced by the prion-like probe peptide. The tau aggregates were dynamic and displayed growth, stability, and shrinking over time. These results could serve as the basis for tau isoform-specific therapeutic interventions.\nAlternative splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay coordinates downregulation of non-neuronal genes in developing neurons\nAuthors: Zhuravskaya, A.; Yap, K.; Hamid, F.; Makeyev, E. V.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556212\nThe functional coupling between alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) and the mRNA quality control mechanism called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) can modulate transcript abundance. Previous studies have identified several examples of such a regulation in developing neurons. However, the systems-level effects of AS-NMD in this context are poorly understood. We developed an R package, factR2, which offers a comprehensive suite of AS-NMD analysis functions. Using this tool, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of gene expression in pluripotent stem cells undergoing induced neuronal differentiation. Our analysis uncovered hundreds of AS-NMD events with significant potential to regulate gene expression. Notably, this regulation was significantly overrepresented in specific functional groups of developmentally downregulated genes. Particularly strong association with gene downregulation was detected for alternative cassette exons stimulating NMD (NS-CEs) upon their inclusion into mature mRNA. By combining bioinformatics analyses with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and other experimental approaches we show that NS-CEs regulated by the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 dampen the expression of their genes in developing neurons. We also provide evidence that the NS-CE activity is temporally coordinated with NMD-independent gene repression mechanisms. Our study provides an accessible workflow for the discovery and prioritization of AS-NMD targets. It further argues that the AS-NMD pathway plays a widespread role in developing neurons by facilitating the downregulation of functionally related non-neuronal genes.\nNatural gene variation in Cannabis sativa unveils a key region of cannabinoid synthase enzymes\nAuthors: Villard, C.; Bayer, C.; Medici, N. P.; van de Peppel, A. C.; Cankar, K.; Verstappen, F.; Kappers, I. F.; Schranz, M. E.; Daniel, B.; van Velzen, R.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555511\nCannabinoids are well-known specialised metabolites from the plant Cannabis sativa L. (cannabis). They exhibit various therapeutical to intoxicating psychoactive effects and have potential for medicinal applications. Among the enzymes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis, cannabinoid oxidocyclases such as the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase play a key role in determining cannabis chemotype. To improve our understanding of cannabinoid oxidocyclase structure-function relationship, we proposed a new approach to targeted mutagenesis. By reviewing cannabis natural variation, three cannabinoid oxidocyclase mutations (S355N, CONF, G376R) associated to atypical plant chemotypes were selected. In-vitro characterization of THCA synthase mutants demonstrated these mutations significantly impact enzyme activity, correlating with the associated chemotype: S355N nearly inactivated the THCA synthase, CONF impaired CBGA metabolization and altered product specificity, while G376R drastically reduced enzyme activity and altered product specificity. In-silico docking experiments permitted to model the successive steps of THCA synthase substrate metabolization, revealing that the three mutations hamper substrate binding. Collectively, our results demonstrated how plant diversity can be leveraged to guide enzyme targeted mutagenesis, highlighted a key region of cannabinoid oxidocyclases, and permitted the establishment of a new model of the THCA synthase catalytic mechanism. This provides new insights into enzyme function, which can ultimately help developing medicinal cannabis cultivars and cannabinoid biotechnological production.\nNRF2 Dysregulation in Mice Leads to Inadequate Beta-Cell Mass Expansion during Pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes\nAuthors: Baumel-Alterzon, S.; Tse, I.; Heidery, F.; Garcia-Ocana, A.; Scott, D. K.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555207\nThe late stages of the mammalian pregnancy are accompanied with increased insulin resistance due to the increased glucose demand of the growing fetus. Therefore, as a compensatory response to maintain the maternal normal blood glucose levels, maternal beta-cell mass expands leading to increased insulin release. Defects in beta-cell adaptive expansion during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Although the exact mechanisms that promote GDM are poorly understood, GDM strongly associates with impaired beta-cell proliferation and with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that NRF2 levels are upregulated in mouse beta-cells at gestation day 15 (GD15) concomitant with increased beta-cell proliferation. Importantly, mice with tamoxifen-induced beta-cell-specific NRF2 deletion display inhibition of beta-cell proliferation, increased beta-cell oxidative stress and elevated levels of beta-cell death at GD15. This results in attenuated beta-cell mass expansion and disturbed glucose homeostasis towards the end of pregnancy. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of NRF2-oxidative stress regulation in beta-cell mass adaptation to pregnancy and suggest NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for treating GDM.\nDual α-globin and truncated erythropoietin receptor knock-in restores hemoglobin production in α-thalassemia major-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells\nAuthors: Chu, S. N.; Soupene, E.; Wienert, B.; Yin, H.; Sharma, D.; Jia, K.; Homma, S.; Hampton, J. P.; Gardner, J. M.; Conklin, B. R.; MacKenzie, T. C.; Porteus, M. H.; Cromer, M. K.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555926\nAlpha-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease with increasing worldwide prevalence. The molecular basis is due to mutation or deletion of one or more duplicated -globin genes, and disease severity is directly related to the number of allelic copies compromised. The most severe form, -thalassemia major (TM), results from loss of all four copies of -globin and has historically resulted in fatality in utero. However, the advent of in utero transfusions now enables the survival of an increasing number of children with TM. Postnatally, patients face challenges similar to {beta}-thalassemia, including severe anemia and erythrotoxicity due to an imbalance of {beta}-globin and -globin chains. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a therapeutic option is limited by donor availability and potential transplant-related complications. Despite progress in genome editing treatments for {beta}-thalassemia, there is no analogous curative option for patients suffering from -thalassemia. To address this, we designed a novel Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that integrates a functional -globin gene into the {beta}-globin locus in TM patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Incorporation of a truncated erythropoietin receptor transgene into the -globin integration cassette dramatically increased erythropoietic output from edited HSPCs and led to the most robust production of -globin, and consequently normal hemoglobin. By directing edited HSPCs toward increased production of clinically relevant RBCs instead of other divergent cell types, this approach has the potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional HSCT for the hemoglobinopathies, including low genome editing and low engraftment rates. These findings support development of a definitive ex vivo autologous genome editing strategy that may be curative for -thalassemia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In healthy individuals, physical exercise improves cardiovascular health and muscle strength, alleviates fatigue, and reduces risk of chronic diseases. Although exercise is suggested as a lifestyle intervention to manage various chronic illnesses, it negatively affects people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), who suffer from exercise intolerance. We hypothesized that altered extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling in ME/CFS patients after an exercise challenge may contribute to their prolonged and exacerbated negative response to exertion (post-exertional malaise). EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from the plasma of 18 female ME/CFS patients and 17 age- and BMI-matched female sedentary controls at three time points: before, 15 minutes, and 24 hours after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis and their protein cargo was quantified using Tandem Mass Tag-based (TMT) proteomics. The results show that exercise affects the EV proteome in ME/CFS patients differently than in healthy individuals and that changes in EV proteins after exercise are strongly correlated with symptom severity in ME/CFS. Differentially abundant proteins in ME/CFS patients vs. controls were involved in many pathways and systems, including coagulation processes, muscle contraction (both smooth and skeletal muscle), cytoskeletal proteins, the immune system, and brain signaling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genome editing with CRISPR RNA-guided endonucleases generates DNA breaks that are resolved by cellular DNA repair machinery. However, analogous methods to manipulate RNA remain unavailable. Here, we show that site-specific RNA breaks generated with RNA-targeting CRISPR complexes are repaired in human cells, and this repair can be used for programmable deletions in human transcripts that restore gene function. Collectively, this work establishes a technology for precise RNA manipulation with potential therapeutic applications.

        <p class="abstract">Microbiome studies have become integral to a wide range of biological research from ecology to oncology, mainly relying on short-read sequencing of variable regions along the 16S rRNA gene. However, the comprehensiveness of 16S rRNA studies has been persistently challenged due to a lack of primer universality and primer biases, causing differences between a study&#39;s results and the underlying bacterial community. Moreover, relying on a small part of the gene often provides low phylogenetic resolution, hampering downstream taxonomy-based analysis and the ability to harmonize results from studies performed using different variable regions. Here, we introduce a framework called &#39;Comprehensive Small Ribosomal Subunit Mapping and Identification of Communities&#39; (CoSMIC), effectively addressing these challenges. CoSMIC begins with long-read full-length sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, using Locked Nucleic Acid primers over pooled samples. This step augments the Small Subunit (SSU) reference database with novel niche-specific SSUs. Subsequently, CoSMIC optimizes a set of primer pairs targeting multiple non-consecutive variable regions along the gene, followed by standard short-read sequencing of each sample. Data from different regions are seamlessly integrated using the SMURF framework, thus alleviating primer-based biases and providing extremely high phylogenetic resolution. We evaluated CoSMIC across plant, root, soil and marine sponge samples, yielding higher profiling accuracy and unprecedented phylogenetic resolution compared to standard methods while detecting ~40,000 novel SSUs. CoSMIC provides researchers with a robust, customizable, and cost-effective framework addressing the challenges of 16S rRNA sequencing, especially in underexplored habitats, paving the way for data harmonization across microbiome studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects a broad spectrum of hosts and can colonize many organs and cell types. The ability to reside within a wide range of different niches requires substantial adaptability to diverse microenvironments. Very little is known about how this parasite senses various milieus and adapts its metabolism to survive, replicate during the acute stage, and then differentiate to the chronic stage. Most eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals, rely on a nutrient sensing machinery involving the TORC complex as master regulator of cell growth and cell cycle progression. The lysosome functions as a signaling hub where TORC complex assembles and is activated by transceptors, which both sense and transport amino acids, including the arginine transceptor SLC38A9. While most of the TORC components are lost in T. gondii, indicating the evolution of a distinct nutrient sensing mechanism, the parasites lysosomal plant-like vacuolar compartment (PLVAC) may still serve as a sensory platform for controlling parasite growth and differentiation. Using SLC38A9 to query the T. gondii proteome, we identified four putative amino acid transporters, termed TgAAT1-4, that structurally resemble the SLC38A9 arginine transceptor. Assessing their expression and sub-cellular localization, we found that one of them, TgAAT1, localized to the PLVAC and is necessary for normal parasite extracellular survival and bradyzoite differentiation. Moreover, we show that TgAAT1 is involved in the PLVAC efflux of arginine, an amino acid playing a key role in T. gondii differentiation, further supporting the hypothesis that TgAAT1 might play a role in nutrient sensing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory arrest peptides exert cellular functions via mechanisms involving regulated translational arrest. Monitoring substrates, a class of arrest peptides, feedback-regulate the expression of the Sec or YidC protein localization machinery. Previously, only a limited number of monitoring substrates were identified. In this study, we performed a bacterial domain-wide search, followed by in vivo and in vitro analyses, leading to a comprehensive identification of many novel Sec/YidC-related arrest peptides that showed patchy, but widespread, phylogenetic distribution throughout the bacterial domain. Identification of five novel arrest-inducing sequences suggests that bacteria have evolved various arrest-inducing mechanisms. We also identified many arrest peptides that share an R-A-P-P like sequence, suggesting that this sequence could serve as a common evolutionary seed that could overcome the species-specific structures of ribosomes, to evolve arrest peptides. Our comprehensive phylogenetic study revealed that arrest peptide is a prevalent mechanism for the gene regulation of the protein localization machinery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prion-like spread of disease-specific tau conformers is a hallmark of all tauopathies. We used a 19-residue probe peptide spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau to induce aggregation specifically of 4R, but not 3R tau. The aggregates can propagate as isoform-specific seeds over multiple generations, have a high {beta}-sheet content, a lipid signal, and resemble the PSP cryo-EM fold. A simulation of peptide free energy landscapes pinpointed the features of the hairpin structure uniquely found in the cryo-EM structures of pure 4R tauopathies and captured in the peptide. These molecular dynamic simulations were experimentally validated by the S305K substitution in 4R tau, corresponding to the position found in 3R tau. This single amino acid substitution prevented tau aggregates induced by the prion-like probe peptide. The tau aggregates were dynamic and displayed growth, stability, and shrinking over time. These results could serve as the basis for tau isoform-specific therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The functional coupling between alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) and the mRNA quality control mechanism called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) can modulate transcript abundance. Previous studies have identified several examples of such a regulation in developing neurons. However, the systems-level effects of AS-NMD in this context are poorly understood. We developed an R package, factR2, which offers a comprehensive suite of AS-NMD analysis functions. Using this tool, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of gene expression in pluripotent stem cells undergoing induced neuronal differentiation. Our analysis uncovered hundreds of AS-NMD events with significant potential to regulate gene expression. Notably, this regulation was significantly overrepresented in specific functional groups of developmentally downregulated genes. Particularly strong association with gene downregulation was detected for alternative cassette exons stimulating NMD (NS-CEs) upon their inclusion into mature mRNA. By combining bioinformatics analyses with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and other experimental approaches we show that NS-CEs regulated by the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 dampen the expression of their genes in developing neurons. We also provide evidence that the NS-CE activity is temporally coordinated with NMD-independent gene repression mechanisms. Our study provides an accessible workflow for the discovery and prioritization of AS-NMD targets. It further argues that the AS-NMD pathway plays a widespread role in developing neurons by facilitating the downregulation of functionally related non-neuronal genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cannabinoids are well-known specialised metabolites from the plant Cannabis sativa L. (cannabis). They exhibit various therapeutical to intoxicating psychoactive effects and have potential for medicinal applications. Among the enzymes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis, cannabinoid oxidocyclases such as the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase play a key role in determining cannabis chemotype. To improve our understanding of cannabinoid oxidocyclase structure-function relationship, we proposed a new approach to targeted mutagenesis. By reviewing cannabis natural variation, three cannabinoid oxidocyclase mutations (S355N, CONF, G376R) associated to atypical plant chemotypes were selected. In-vitro characterization of THCA synthase mutants demonstrated these mutations significantly impact enzyme activity, correlating with the associated chemotype: S355N nearly inactivated the THCA synthase, CONF impaired CBGA metabolization and altered product specificity, while G376R drastically reduced enzyme activity and altered product specificity. In-silico docking experiments permitted to model the successive steps of THCA synthase substrate metabolization, revealing that the three mutations hamper substrate binding. Collectively, our results demonstrated how plant diversity can be leveraged to guide enzyme targeted mutagenesis, highlighted a key region of cannabinoid oxidocyclases, and permitted the establishment of a new model of the THCA synthase catalytic mechanism. This provides new insights into enzyme function, which can ultimately help developing medicinal cannabis cultivars and cannabinoid biotechnological production.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The late stages of the mammalian pregnancy are accompanied with increased insulin resistance due to the increased glucose demand of the growing fetus. Therefore, as a compensatory response to maintain the maternal normal blood glucose levels, maternal beta-cell mass expands leading to increased insulin release. Defects in beta-cell adaptive expansion during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Although the exact mechanisms that promote GDM are poorly understood, GDM strongly associates with impaired beta-cell proliferation and with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that NRF2 levels are upregulated in mouse beta-cells at gestation day 15 (GD15) concomitant with increased beta-cell proliferation. Importantly, mice with tamoxifen-induced beta-cell-specific NRF2 deletion display inhibition of beta-cell proliferation, increased beta-cell oxidative stress and elevated levels of beta-cell death at GD15. This results in attenuated beta-cell mass expansion and disturbed glucose homeostasis towards the end of pregnancy. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of NRF2-oxidative stress regulation in beta-cell mass adaptation to pregnancy and suggest NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for treating GDM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alpha-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease with increasing worldwide prevalence. The molecular basis is due to mutation or deletion of one or more duplicated -globin genes, and disease severity is directly related to the number of allelic copies compromised. The most severe form, -thalassemia major (TM), results from loss of all four copies of -globin and has historically resulted in fatality in utero. However, the advent of in utero transfusions now enables the survival of an increasing number of children with TM. Postnatally, patients face challenges similar to {beta}-thalassemia, including severe anemia and erythrotoxicity due to an imbalance of {beta}-globin and -globin chains. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a therapeutic option is limited by donor availability and potential transplant-related complications. Despite progress in genome editing treatments for {beta}-thalassemia, there is no analogous curative option for patients suffering from -thalassemia. To address this, we designed a novel Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that integrates a functional -globin gene into the {beta}-globin locus in TM patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Incorporation of a truncated erythropoietin receptor transgene into the -globin integration cassette dramatically increased erythropoietic output from edited HSPCs and led to the most robust production of -globin, and consequently normal hemoglobin. By directing edited HSPCs toward increased production of clinically relevant RBCs instead of other divergent cell types, this approach has the potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional HSCT for the hemoglobinopathies, including low genome editing and low engraftment rates. These findings support development of a definitive ex vivo autologous genome editing strategy that may be curative for -thalassemia.</p>
