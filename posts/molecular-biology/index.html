P.\nScore: 55.3, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.17.504273\nMicrotubule motors, like cytoplasmic dynein-1, are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activity in cells. Dynein functions as a [~]4 MDa complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognise diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as LIS1 remain unclear. To address this, we determine the cryo-EM structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. We show how JIP3 specifies complex formation despite a shorter coiled coil and lack of identifiable motifs compared to typical adaptors. We find LIS1 directly binds dynactins p150 subunit, closely tethering it to dynein. This interaction is necessary for dyneins cellular and in vitro activity. We also show how dyneins intermediate chain relieves p150s autoinhibition to enable LIS1 binding. Together, our data suggest LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.\nDeep screening of proximal and distal splicing-regulatory elements in a native sequence context\nAuthors: Recinos, Y.; Ustianenko, D.; Yeh, Y.-T.; Wang, X.; Jacko, M.; Yesantharao, L. V.; Wu, Q.; Zhang, C.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554109\nPre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is impeded by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically dead CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identified not only known SREs, but also a novel distal intronic splicing enhancer, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.\nMutual homeostasis of charged proteins\nAuthors: Faraway, R.; Heaven, N. C.; Digby, H.; Wilkins, O. G.; Chakrabarti, A. M.; Iosub, I. A.; Knez, L.; Ameres, S. L.; Plaschka, C.; Ule, J.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554177\nProtein dosage is regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis and health. The dosage of proteins containing disordered low complexity domains (LCDs) must be particularly well-controlled to prevent aberrant disease, yet no mechanism to maintain homeostasis has been identified1, 2. Here we report a mutual homeostatic mechanism that controls the concentration of such proteins, termed interstasis, in which proteins with similar LCDs co-regulate their combined dosage through collective negative feedback. We focused on the mechanism that exploits the fundamental multivalency of GA-rich RNA regions that encode charged LCDs, including those with arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs). Modest variations in the abundance of an R-MCD protein change the properties of nuclear speckles, a protein-RNA condensate, selectively trapping multivalent GA-rich mRNAs to promote their nuclear retention. This interstasis depends on conserved codon biases, shared by amniotes, which enhance the multivalency of GA-rich regions encoding charged LCDs. The threshold of interstasis is modulated by CLK kinases, which affect the nuclear speckle localisation of proteins such as TRA2B, key binder of GA-rich RNAs. Notably, many classes of LCDs are encoded by RNA regions containing multivalency-enhancing codon biases, each preferentially bound by specific proteins, suggesting that interstasis might co-regulate many classes of functionally related LCD-containing proteins through dose-sensitivity of various types of protein-RNA condensates.\nA bacterial expression cloning screen reveals tardigrade single-stranded DNA-binding proteins as potent desicco-protectants\nAuthors: Hibshman, J. D.; Clark-Hachtel, C. M.; Bloom, K. S.; Goldstein, B.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554171\nTardigrades are known for their ability to survive remarkable extremes, but relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings that allow for their extraordinary stress tolerance. We devised an expression cloning approach to screen for novel protectants from desiccation-tolerant tardigrades. We expressed cDNA libraries from the tardigrades Hypsibius exemplaris and Ramazzottius varieornatus in E. coli and subjected the bacteria to desiccation. Sequencing the populations of surviving bacteria revealed enrichment of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (mtSSBs) from both tardigrade species. Expression of mtSSBs in bacteria improved desiccation survival to similar levels as some of the best protectants known to date. The DNA-binding activity of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold domain of mtSSB was necessary and sufficient to improve desiccation tolerance. By comparing the efficacy of mtSSBs from multiple organisms, we provide evidence that desicco-protection is a conserved feature of mtSSBs. More broadly, any OB-fold containing protein may act similarly to promote desiccation tolerance, likely by coating ssDNA to limit damage during desiccation. These results identify single-stranded DNA-binding activity as a potent contributor to extreme desiccation tolerance.\nConserved and species-specific transcriptional responses to daily programmed resistance exercise in rat and mouse.\nAuthors: Viggars, M. R.; Sutherland, H.; Cardozo, C. P.; Jarvis, J. C.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.552047\nMice are often used in gain or loss of function studies to understand how genes regulate metabolism and adaptation to exercise in skeletal muscle. Once-daily resistance training with electrical nerve stimulation produces hypertrophy of the dorsiflexors in rat, but not in mouse. Using implantable pulse generators, we assessed the acute transcriptional response (1-hour post exercise) after 2, 10 and 20 days of training in free living mice and rats using identical nerve stimulation paradigms. RNA-sequencing revealed strong concordance in the timecourse of many transcriptional responses in the tibialis anterior muscles of both species including responses related to 'stress responses/immediate-early genes', and 'collagen homeostasis', 'ribosomal subunits', 'autophagy' and 'focal adhesion'. However, pathways associated with energy metabolism including 'carbon metabolism', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'mitochondrial translation', 'propanoate metabolism' and 'valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation' were oppositely regulated between species. These pathways were suppressed in the rat but upregulated in the mouse. Our transcriptional analysis suggests that although many pathways associated with growth show remarkable similarities between species, absence of an actual growth response in the mouse may be because the mouse prioritises energy metabolism, specifically replenishment of fuel stores and intermediate metabolites.\nCanonical and non-canonical contributions of human Dicer helicase domain in antiviral defense\nAuthors: Baldaccini, M.; Gaucherand, L.; Chane-Woon-Ming, B.; Messmer, M.; Gucciardi, F.; Pfeffer, S.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554407\nIn mammals, the co-existence of RNAi and the type I interferon response in somatic cells begs the question of their compatibility and relative contribution during viral infection. Previous studies provided hints that both mitigating co-factors and self-limiting properties of key proteins such as Dicer could explain the apparent inefficiency of antiviral RNAi. Indeed, the helicase domain of human Dicer limits its processing activity and acts as an interaction platform for co-factors that could hinder its function. We studied the involvement of several helicase-truncated mutants of human Dicer in the antiviral response. We show that all deletion mutants display an antiviral phenotype against alphaviruses and an enterovirus. While only one of them, Dicer N1, is antiviral in an RNAi-independent manner, they all require the expression of PKR to be active. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the antiviral phenotype of Dicer N1 expressing cells, we analyzed their transcriptome and found that many genes from the interferon and inflammatory response were upregulated. We could show that these genes appear to be controlled by transcription factors such as STAT-1, STAT-2, and NF-kB. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking the NF-kB pathway in Dicer N1 cells abrogated their antiviral phenotype. Our findings highlight the crosstalk between Dicer, PKR, and the IFN-I pathway, and suggest that human Dicer may have repurposed its helicase domain to prevent basal activation of antiviral and inflammatory pathways.\nHighly multiplexed mRNA quantitation with CRISPR-Cas13\nAuthors: Kang, B.; Zhang, J.; Schwoerer, M. P.; Nelson, A. N.; Schoeman, E.; Ploss, A.; Myhrvold, C.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553527\nRNA quantitation tools are often either high-throughput or cost-effective, but rarely are they both. Existing methods can profile the transcriptome at great expense or are limited to quantifying a handful of genes by labor constraints. A technique that permits more throughput at a reduced cost could enable multi-gene kinetic studies, gene regulatory network analysis, and combinatorial genetic screens. Here, we introduce quantitative Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (qCARMEN): an RNA quantitation technique which leverages the programmable RNA-targeting capabilities of CRISPR-Cas13 to address this challenge by quantifying over 4,500 gene-sample pairs in a single experiment. Using qCARMEN, we studied the response profiles of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during interferon (IFN) stimulation and flavivirus infection. Additionally, we observed isoform switching kinetics during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. qCARMEN is a simple and inexpensive technique that greatly enhances the scalability of RNA quantitation for novel applications with performance similar to gold-standard methods.\nBMP7 promotes cardiomyocyte regeneration\nAuthors: Bongiovanni, C.; Bueno-Levy, H.; Posadas Pena, S. D.; Del Bono, I.; Redaelli, S.; Bergen, M.; Da Pra, S.; Sacchi, F.; Miano, C.; Boriati, S.; Pontis, F.; Romaniello, D.; Mazzeschi, M.; Petraroia, I.; Tassinari, R.; Kellerer, L.; Lauriola, M.; Ventura, C.; Heermann, S.; Weidinger, G.; Tzahor, E.; D'Uva, G.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553475\nZebrafish has a remarkable and lifelong ability for cardiac regeneration after severe damage, whereas mammals lose their innate capacity for heart regeneration during early postnatal development. This study aimed to investigate whether the decreased production of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle and the reduction in cardiac regenerative ability. We identified growth factors with declining expression levels during early postnatal life in the mouse model and assessed the pro-proliferative ability of these factors on neonatal murine primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our findings confirmed the previously reported pro-proliferative effects of NRG1, IL1b, RANKL, IGF2 and IL6, while also identifying novel potential pro-regenerative growth factors. Among them, BMP7 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy. Bmp7 knockdown interfered with the proliferation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture and adult bmp7 mutant zebrafish displayed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression was sufficient to boost cardiomyocyte cycling in regenerating zebrafish hearts, while BMP7 administration stimulated mouse cardiomyocyte cycling at postnatal-day-7, when cardiomyocytes ceased to proliferate, and enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo in adult mice following myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, BMP7-induced proliferation was mediated by type I BMP receptors BMPR1A and ACVR1, and type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. Downstream signalling involved SMAD5, ERK and AKT. In conclusion, the administration of BMP7 holds promise as a strategy to stimulate heart regeneration following cardiac injury.\nThe ClpX chaperone and a hypermorphic FtsA variant with impaired self-interaction are mutually compensatory for coordinating Staphylococcus aureus cell division\nAuthors: Henriksen, C.; Baek, K.; Wacnik, K.; Gallay, C.; Veening, J.-W.; Foster, S. J.; Frees, D.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554348\nBacterial cell division requires the coordinated assembly and disassembly of a large protein complex called the divisome, however, the exact role of molecular chaperones in this critical process remains unclear. In the important pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpX chaperone is essential for growth at 30{degrees}C and microscopic analyses suggested that ClpX plays a temperature-dependent role in cell division. We here provide genetic evidence that ClpX unfoldase activity is a determinant for proper coordination of cell division by showing that a spontaneous G325V substitution in the ATP-binding domain of the essential FtsA cell division protein rescues growth and septum synthesis in a Staphylococcus aureus clpX mutant. The polymerization state of FtsA is thought to control initiation of bacterial septum synthesis and, while restoring the aberrant FtsA dynamics in clpX cells, the FtsAG325V variant displayed reduced ability to interact with itself and other cell division proteins. In wild-type cells, the ftsAG325V allele shared phenotypes with E. coli superfission ftsA mutants and accelerated the cell cycle, increased the risk of daughter cell lysis, and conferred sensitivity to heat and antibiotics inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Strikingly, lethality was mitigated by spontaneous mutations that inactivate ClpX. Taken together, our results suggest that ClpX promotes septum synthesis by antagonizing FtsA interactions and illuminates the critical role of a protein unfoldase in coordinating bacterial cell division.\nLeucine suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic islets by directly modulating alpha-cell cAMP\nAuthors: Knuth, E. R.; Foster, H. R.; Jin, E.; Merrins, M. J.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551113\nObjectivePancreatic islets are nutrient sensors that regulate organismal blood glucose homeostasis. Glucagon release from the pancreatic -cell is important under fasted, fed, and hypoglycemic conditions, yet metabolic regulation of -cells remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a previously unexplored role for physiological levels of leucine, which is classically regarded as a {beta}-cell fuel, in the intrinsic regulation of -cell glucagon release. MethodsGcgCreERT:CAMPER and GcgCreERT:GCaMP6s mice were generated to perform dynamic, high-throughput functional measurements of -cell cAMP and Ca2+ within the intact islet. Islet perifusion assays were used for simultaneous, time-resolved measurements of glucagon and insulin release from mouse and human islets. The effects of leucine were compared with glucose and the mitochondrial fuels 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, non-metabolized leucine analog that activates glutamate dehydrogenase), -ketoisocaproate (KIC, leucine metabolite), and methyl-succinate (complex II fuel). CYN154806 (Sstr2 antagonist), diazoxide (KATP activator, which prevents Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from , {beta}, and {delta}-cells), and dispersed -cells were used to inhibit islet paracrine signaling and identify -cell intrinsic effects. ResultsMimicking the effect of glucose, leucine strongly suppressed amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, leucine dose-dependently reduced -cell cAMP at physiological concentrations, with an IC50 of 57, 440, and 1162 M at 2, 6, and 10 mM glucose, without affecting -cell Ca2+. Leucine also reduced -cell cAMP in islets treated with Sstr2 antagonist or diazoxide, as well as dispersed -cells, indicating an -cell intrinsic effect. The effect of leucine was matched by KIC and the glutamate dehydrogenase activator BCH, but not methyl-succinate, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glucose, which stimulates anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, had the same suppressive effect on -cell cAMP but with lower potency. Similarly to mouse islets, leucine suppressed glucagon secretion from human islets under hypoglycemic conditions. ConclusionsThese findings highlight an important role for physiological levels of leucine in the metabolic regulation of -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion. Leucine functions primarily through an -cell intrinsic effect that is dependent on glutamate dehydrogenase, in addition to the well-established -cell regulation by {beta}/{delta}-cell paracrine signaling. Our results suggest that mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis facilitates the glucagonostatic effect of both leucine and glucose, which cooperatively suppress -cell tone by reducing cAMP.

        <p class="abstract">Microtubule motors, like cytoplasmic dynein-1, are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activity in cells. Dynein functions as a [~]4 MDa complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognise diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as LIS1 remain unclear. To address this, we determine the cryo-EM structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. We show how JIP3 specifies complex formation despite a shorter coiled coil and lack of identifiable motifs compared to typical adaptors. We find LIS1 directly binds dynactins p150 subunit, closely tethering it to dynein. This interaction is necessary for dyneins cellular and in vitro activity. We also show how dyneins intermediate chain relieves p150s autoinhibition to enable LIS1 binding. Together, our data suggest LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is impeded by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically dead CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identified not only known SREs, but also a novel distal intronic splicing enhancer, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein dosage is regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis and health. The dosage of proteins containing disordered low complexity domains (LCDs) must be particularly well-controlled to prevent aberrant disease, yet no mechanism to maintain homeostasis has been identified1, 2. Here we report a mutual homeostatic mechanism that controls the concentration of such proteins, termed interstasis, in which proteins with similar LCDs co-regulate their combined dosage through collective negative feedback. We focused on the mechanism that exploits the fundamental multivalency of GA-rich RNA regions that encode charged LCDs, including those with arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs). Modest variations in the abundance of an R-MCD protein change the properties of nuclear speckles, a protein-RNA condensate, selectively trapping multivalent GA-rich mRNAs to promote their nuclear retention. This interstasis depends on conserved codon biases, shared by amniotes, which enhance the multivalency of GA-rich regions encoding charged LCDs. The threshold of interstasis is modulated by CLK kinases, which affect the nuclear speckle localisation of proteins such as TRA2B, key binder of GA-rich RNAs. Notably, many classes of LCDs are encoded by RNA regions containing multivalency-enhancing codon biases, each preferentially bound by specific proteins, suggesting that interstasis might co-regulate many classes of functionally related LCD-containing proteins through dose-sensitivity of various types of protein-RNA condensates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades are known for their ability to survive remarkable extremes, but relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings that allow for their extraordinary stress tolerance. We devised an expression cloning approach to screen for novel protectants from desiccation-tolerant tardigrades. We expressed cDNA libraries from the tardigrades Hypsibius exemplaris and Ramazzottius varieornatus in E. coli and subjected the bacteria to desiccation. Sequencing the populations of surviving bacteria revealed enrichment of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (mtSSBs) from both tardigrade species. Expression of mtSSBs in bacteria improved desiccation survival to similar levels as some of the best protectants known to date. The DNA-binding activity of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold domain of mtSSB was necessary and sufficient to improve desiccation tolerance. By comparing the efficacy of mtSSBs from multiple organisms, we provide evidence that desicco-protection is a conserved feature of mtSSBs. More broadly, any OB-fold containing protein may act similarly to promote desiccation tolerance, likely by coating ssDNA to limit damage during desiccation. These results identify single-stranded DNA-binding activity as a potent contributor to extreme desiccation tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mice are often used in gain or loss of function studies to understand how genes regulate metabolism and adaptation to exercise in skeletal muscle. Once-daily resistance training with electrical nerve stimulation produces hypertrophy of the dorsiflexors in rat, but not in mouse. Using implantable pulse generators, we assessed the acute transcriptional response (1-hour post exercise) after 2, 10 and 20 days of training in free living mice and rats using identical nerve stimulation paradigms. RNA-sequencing revealed strong concordance in the timecourse of many transcriptional responses in the tibialis anterior muscles of both species including responses related to &#39;stress responses/immediate-early genes&#39;, and &#39;collagen homeostasis&#39;, &#39;ribosomal subunits&#39;, &#39;autophagy&#39; and &#39;focal adhesion&#39;. However, pathways associated with energy metabolism including &#39;carbon metabolism&#39;, &#39;oxidative phosphorylation&#39;, &#39;mitochondrial translation&#39;, &#39;propanoate metabolism&#39; and &#39;valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation&#39; were oppositely regulated between species. These pathways were suppressed in the rat but upregulated in the mouse. Our transcriptional analysis suggests that although many pathways associated with growth show remarkable similarities between species, absence of an actual growth response in the mouse may be because the mouse prioritises energy metabolism, specifically replenishment of fuel stores and intermediate metabolites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In mammals, the co-existence of RNAi and the type I interferon response in somatic cells begs the question of their compatibility and relative contribution during viral infection. Previous studies provided hints that both mitigating co-factors and self-limiting properties of key proteins such as Dicer could explain the apparent inefficiency of antiviral RNAi. Indeed, the helicase domain of human Dicer limits its processing activity and acts as an interaction platform for co-factors that could hinder its function. We studied the involvement of several helicase-truncated mutants of human Dicer in the antiviral response. We show that all deletion mutants display an antiviral phenotype against alphaviruses and an enterovirus. While only one of them, Dicer N1, is antiviral in an RNAi-independent manner, they all require the expression of PKR to be active. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the antiviral phenotype of Dicer N1 expressing cells, we analyzed their transcriptome and found that many genes from the interferon and inflammatory response were upregulated. We could show that these genes appear to be controlled by transcription factors such as STAT-1, STAT-2, and NF-kB. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking the NF-kB pathway in Dicer N1 cells abrogated their antiviral phenotype. Our findings highlight the crosstalk between Dicer, PKR, and the IFN-I pathway, and suggest that human Dicer may have repurposed its helicase domain to prevent basal activation of antiviral and inflammatory pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA quantitation tools are often either high-throughput or cost-effective, but rarely are they both. Existing methods can profile the transcriptome at great expense or are limited to quantifying a handful of genes by labor constraints. A technique that permits more throughput at a reduced cost could enable multi-gene kinetic studies, gene regulatory network analysis, and combinatorial genetic screens. Here, we introduce quantitative Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (qCARMEN): an RNA quantitation technique which leverages the programmable RNA-targeting capabilities of CRISPR-Cas13 to address this challenge by quantifying over 4,500 gene-sample pairs in a single experiment. Using qCARMEN, we studied the response profiles of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during interferon (IFN) stimulation and flavivirus infection. Additionally, we observed isoform switching kinetics during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. qCARMEN is a simple and inexpensive technique that greatly enhances the scalability of RNA quantitation for novel applications with performance similar to gold-standard methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zebrafish has a remarkable and lifelong ability for cardiac regeneration after severe damage, whereas mammals lose their innate capacity for heart regeneration during early postnatal development. This study aimed to investigate whether the decreased production of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle and the reduction in cardiac regenerative ability.

We identified growth factors with declining expression levels during early postnatal life in the mouse model and assessed the pro-proliferative ability of these factors on neonatal murine primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our findings confirmed the previously reported pro-proliferative effects of NRG1, IL1b, RANKL, IGF2 and IL6, while also identifying novel potential pro-regenerative growth factors. Among them, BMP7 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy.

Bmp7 knockdown interfered with the proliferation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture and adult bmp7 mutant zebrafish displayed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression was sufficient to boost cardiomyocyte cycling in regenerating zebrafish hearts, while BMP7 administration stimulated mouse cardiomyocyte cycling at postnatal-day-7, when cardiomyocytes ceased to proliferate, and enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo in adult mice following myocardial infarction.

Mechanistically, BMP7-induced proliferation was mediated by type I BMP receptors BMPR1A and ACVR1, and type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. Downstream signalling involved SMAD5, ERK and AKT.

In conclusion, the administration of BMP7 holds promise as a strategy to stimulate heart regeneration following cardiac injury.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial cell division requires the coordinated assembly and disassembly of a large protein complex called the divisome, however, the exact role of molecular chaperones in this critical process remains unclear. In the important pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpX chaperone is essential for growth at 30{degrees}C and microscopic analyses suggested that ClpX plays a temperature-dependent role in cell division. We here provide genetic evidence that ClpX unfoldase activity is a determinant for proper coordination of cell division by showing that a spontaneous G325V substitution in the ATP-binding domain of the essential FtsA cell division protein rescues growth and septum synthesis in a Staphylococcus aureus clpX mutant. The polymerization state of FtsA is thought to control initiation of bacterial septum synthesis and, while restoring the aberrant FtsA dynamics in clpX cells, the FtsAG325V variant displayed reduced ability to interact with itself and other cell division proteins. In wild-type cells, the ftsAG325V allele shared phenotypes with E. coli superfission ftsA mutants and accelerated the cell cycle, increased the risk of daughter cell lysis, and conferred sensitivity to heat and antibiotics inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Strikingly, lethality was mitigated by spontaneous mutations that inactivate ClpX. Taken together, our results suggest that ClpX promotes septum synthesis by antagonizing FtsA interactions and illuminates the critical role of a protein unfoldase in coordinating bacterial cell division.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivePancreatic islets are nutrient sensors that regulate organismal blood glucose homeostasis. Glucagon release from the pancreatic -cell is important under fasted, fed, and hypoglycemic conditions, yet metabolic regulation of -cells remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a previously unexplored role for physiological levels of leucine, which is classically regarded as a {beta}-cell fuel, in the intrinsic regulation of -cell glucagon release.

MethodsGcgCreERT:CAMPER and GcgCreERT:GCaMP6s mice were generated to perform dynamic, high-throughput functional measurements of -cell cAMP and Ca2&#43; within the intact islet. Islet perifusion assays were used for simultaneous, time-resolved measurements of glucagon and insulin release from mouse and human islets. The effects of leucine were compared with glucose and the mitochondrial fuels 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, non-metabolized leucine analog that activates glutamate dehydrogenase), -ketoisocaproate (KIC, leucine metabolite), and methyl-succinate (complex II fuel). CYN154806 (Sstr2 antagonist), diazoxide (KATP activator, which prevents Ca2&#43;-dependent exocytosis from , {beta}, and {delta}-cells), and dispersed -cells were used to inhibit islet paracrine signaling and identify -cell intrinsic effects.

ResultsMimicking the effect of glucose, leucine strongly suppressed amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, leucine dose-dependently reduced -cell cAMP at physiological concentrations, with an IC50 of 57, 440, and 1162 M at 2, 6, and 10 mM glucose, without affecting -cell Ca2&#43;. Leucine also reduced -cell cAMP in islets treated with Sstr2 antagonist or diazoxide, as well as dispersed -cells, indicating an -cell intrinsic effect. The effect of leucine was matched by KIC and the glutamate dehydrogenase activator BCH, but not methyl-succinate, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glucose, which stimulates anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, had the same suppressive effect on -cell cAMP but with lower potency. Similarly to mouse islets, leucine suppressed glucagon secretion from human islets under hypoglycemic conditions.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight an important role for physiological levels of leucine in the metabolic regulation of -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion. Leucine functions primarily through an -cell intrinsic effect that is dependent on glutamate dehydrogenase, in addition to the well-established -cell regulation by {beta}/{delta}-cell paracrine signaling. Our results suggest that mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis facilitates the glucagonostatic effect of both leucine and glucose, which cooperatively suppress -cell tone by reducing cAMP.
