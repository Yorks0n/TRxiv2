F.\nScore: 49.5, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568561\nIn plants and mammals, non-homologous end-joining is the dominant pathway to repair DNA double strand breaks, making it challenging to generate knock-in events. Using a transient assay in Nicotiana benthamiana we identified two groups of exonucleases, respectively from the Herpes Virus and from the bacteriophage T7 families, hat confer up to 38-fold increase in HDR frequencies when fused to Cas9. We achieved precise and scar-free insertion of several kilobases of DNA both in transient and stable transformation systems. In Arabidopsis thaliana, fusion of Cas9 to a Herpes Virus family exonuclease leads to 10-fold higher frequencies of knock-ins. Our results open perspectives for the routine production of knock-in and gene replacement events in plants. One-Sentence SummaryFusions of CRISPR endonucleases to specific 5'-exonucleases leads to significant increase in scar-free multikilobase knock-ins.\nSpatial transcriptomics defines injury-specific microenvironments in the adult mouse kidney and novel cellular interactions in regeneration and disease\nAuthors: Polonsky, M.; Gerhardt, L. M. S.; Yun, J.; Koppitch, K.; Colon, K.; Amrhein, H.; Zheng, S.; Yuan, G.-C.; Thomson, M.; Cai, L.; McMahon, A. P.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568217\nKidney injury disrupts the intricate renal architecture and triggers limited regeneration, and injury-invoked inflammation and fibrosis. Deciphering molecular pathways and cellular interactions driving these processes is challenging due to the complex renal architecture. Here, we applied single cell spatial transcriptomics to examine ischemia-reperfusion injury in the mouse kidney. Spatial transcriptomics revealed injury-specific and spatially-dependent gene expression patterns in distinct cellular microenvironments within the kidney and predicted Clcf1-Crfl1 in a molecular interplay between persistently injured proximal tubule cells and neighboring fibroblasts. Immune cell types play a critical role in organ repair. Spatial analysis revealed cellular microenvironments resembling early tertiary lymphoid structures and identified associated molecular pathways. Collectively, this study supports a focus on molecular interactions in cellular microenvironments to enhance understanding of injury, repair and disease. One-Sentence Summary: Spatial transcriptomics predicted a molecular interplay amongst neighboring cell-types in the injured mammalian kidney Main Text:\nTranscription-coupled changes in higher-order genomic structure and transcription hub viscosity prolong enhancer-promoter connectivity\nAuthors: Ohishi, H.; Shinkai, S.; Owada, H.; Fujii, T.; Hosoda, K.; Onami, S.; Yamamoto, T.; Ohkawa, Y.; Ochiai, H.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568629\nThe orchestration of our genes heavily relies on a coordinated communication between enhancers and promoters, yet how this dynamic interplay remains elusive while transcription is active. Here, we investigated enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions and relative to transcriptional bursting in mouse embryonic stem cells using sequential DNA/RNA/immunofluorescence (IF)-FISH analyses and computational simulations. Our data reveal that the active state of specific genes is characterized by higher-order genomic structures and local condensates of transcriptional regulatory factors, leading to an elevation in local viscosity that highly stabilizes the duration of E-P interactions. Our study underscores the pivotal role of viscosity in transcriptional dynamics and paves the way for a more nuanced understanding of gene-specific regulatory mechanisms.\nAntagonistic conflict between transposon-encoded introns and guide RNAs\nAuthors: Zedaveinyte, R.; Meers, C.; Le, H. C.; Mortman, E. E.; Tang, S.; Lampe, G. D.; Pesari, S. R.; Gelsinger, D. R.; Wiegand, T.; Sternberg, S. H.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567912\nTnpB nucleases represent the evolutionary precursors to CRISPR-Cas12 and are widespread in all domains of life, presumably due to the critical roles they play in transposon proliferation. IS605-family TnpB homologs function in bacteria as programmable homing endonucleases by exploiting transposon-encoded guide RNAs to cleave vacant genomic sites, thereby driving transposon maintenance through DSB-stimulated homologous recombination. Whether this pathway is conserved in other genetic contexts, and in association with other transposases, is unknown. Here we uncover molecular mechanisms of transposition and RNA-guided DNA cleavage by IS607-family elements that, remarkably, also encode catalytic, self-splicing group I introns. After reconstituting and systematically investigating each of these biochemical activities for a candidate IStron derived from Clostridium botulinum, we discovered sequence and structural features of the transposon-encoded RNA that satisfy molecular requirements of a group I intron and TnpB guide RNA, while still retaining the ability to be faithfully mobilized at the DNA level by the TnpA transposase. Strikingly, intron splicing was strongly repressed not only by TnpB, but also by the secondary structure of {omega}RNA alone, allowing the element to carefully control the relative levels of spliced products versus functional guide RNAs. Our results suggest that IStron transcripts have evolved a sensitive equilibrium to balance competing and mutually exclusive activities that promote transposon maintenance while limiting adverse fitness costs on the host. Collectively, this work explains how diverse enzymatic activities emerged during the selfish spread of IS607-family elements and highlights molecular innovation in the multi-functional utility of transposon-encoded noncoding RNAs.\nCodon optimality modulates protein output by tuning translation initiation\nAuthors: Lyons, E. F.; Devanneaux, L. C.; Muller, R. Y.; Freitas, A. V.; Meacham, Z. A.; McSharry, M. V.; Trinh, V. N.; Rogers, A. J.; Ingolia, N. T.; Lareau, L. F.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568910\nThe impact of synonymous codon choice on protein output has important implications for understanding endogenous gene expression and design of synthetic mRNAs. Previously, we used a neural network model to design a series of synonymous fluorescent reporters whose protein output in yeast spanned a seven-fold range corresponding to their predicted translation speed. Here, we show that this effect is not due primarily to the established impact of slow elongation on mRNA stability, but rather, that an active mechanism further decreases the number of proteins made per mRNA. We combine simulations and careful experiments on fluorescent reporters to argue that translation initiation is limited on non-optimally encoded transcripts. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to discover factors modulating the output from non-optimal transcripts, we identify a set of translation initiation factors including multiple subunits of eIF3 whose depletion restored protein output of a non-optimal reporter. Our results show that codon usage can directly limit protein production, across the full range of endogenous variability in codon usage, by limiting translation initiation.\nReversible histone deacetylase activity catalyzes lysine acylation\nAuthors: Tsusaka, T.; Najar, M. A.; Schwarz, B.; Bohrnsen, E.; Oses-Prieto, J. A.; Lee, C.; Burlingame, A. L.; Bosio, C. M.; Burslem, G. M.; Goldberg, E. L.\nScore: 38.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567549\nStarvation and low carbohydrate diets lead to the accumulation of the ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), whose blood concentrations increase more than 10-fold into the millimolar range. In addition to providing a carbon source, BHB accumulation triggers lysine {beta}-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of proteins via unknown mechanisms. As with other lysine acylation events, Kbhb marks can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we report that class I HDACs unexpectedly catalyze protein lysine modification with {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Mutational analyses of the HDAC2 active site reveal a shared reliance on key amino acids for classical deacetylation and non-canonical HDAC-catalyzed {beta}-hydroxybutyrylation. Also consistent with reverse HDAC activity, Kbhb formation is driven by mass action and substrate availability. This reverse HDAC activity is not limited to BHB but also extends to multiple short-chain fatty acids. The reversible activity of class I HDACs described here represents a novel mechanism of PTM deposition relevant to metabolically-sensitive proteome modifications.\nMsc1 is a nuclear envelope protein that reinforces DNA repair in late mitosis.\nAuthors: Medina-Suarez, S.; Ayra-Plasencia, J.; Perez-Martinez, L.; Butter, F.; Machin, F.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568106\nPrecise double-strand break (DSB) repair is paramount for genome stability. Homologous recombination (HR) repairs DSBs when cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is high, which correlates with the availability of the sister chromatid as a template. However, anaphase and telophase are paradoxical scenarios since high CDK favors HR despite sister chromatids being no longer aligned. To identify factors specifically involved in DSB repair in late mitosis, we have undertaken comparative proteomics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that Msc1, a poorly characterized nuclear envelope protein, is significantly enriched upon both random and guided DSBs. We further show that {Delta}msc1 is more sensitive to DSBs in late mitosis, and has a delayed repair of DBSs, as indicated by increased Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, fewer Rad52 repair factories, and slower HR completion. We discuss how Msc1 may favor the formation of Rad52 factories and the timely completion of HR before cytokinesis.\nTranscription termination by RNA polymerase I\nAuthors: Turowski, T. W.; Petfalski, E.; Winz, M.-L.; Tollervey, D.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568579\nTranscription elongation is stochastic and driven by a Brownian ratchet mechanism, making it subject to changes in velocity. However, on regions occupied by multiple polymerases, notably the rDNA, DNA rotation plus torsion constrain polymerase molecules to proceed at the same rate generating \"torsional entrainment\". We report that release of entrainment, by co-transcriptional 3-end cleavage, is permissive for relative movement between polymerases, promoting pausing and backtracking. Subsequent termination (polymerase release) is facilitated by the 5-exonuclease Rat1 (Xrn2) and backtracked transcript cleavage by RNAPI subunit Rpa12. These activities were reproduced in vitro. Short nascent transcripts close to the transcriptional start site, combined with nascent transcript folding energy, similarly facilitate RNAPI pausing. Nascent, backtracked transcripts at pause sites, are targeted by both the exosome cofactor TRAMP and Rat1, promoting termination. Topoisomerase 2 localizes adjacent to RNAPI pause sites, potentially allowing continued elongation by downstream polymerases. Biophysical modeling supported substantial ([~]10%) premature termination. HighlightsNascent pre-rRNA 3 cleavage promotes RNAPI deceleration and termination RNAPI undergoes early, start-site proximal termination at sites of polymerase pausing Biophysical modeling indicates [~]10% early termination - or [~]100 events per minute Model presented for overall organization of pre-rRNA transcription\nSymbiosis modulates gene expression of symbionts, but not hosts, under thermal challenge\nAuthors: Aichelman, H.

W.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568130\nIncreasing ocean temperatures are causing dysbiosis between coral hosts and their symbionts. Previous work suggests that coral host gene expression responds more strongly to environmental stress compared to their intracellular symbionts; however, the causes and consequences of this phenomenon remain untested. We hypothesized that symbionts are less responsive because hosts modulate symbiont environments to buffer stress. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged the facultative symbiosis between the scleractinian coral Oculina arbuscula and its symbiont Breviolum psygmophilum to characterize gene expression responses of both symbiotic partners in and ex hospite under thermal challenges. To characterize host and in hospite symbiont responses, symbiotic and aposymbiotic O. arbuscula were exposed to three treatments: 1) control (18{degrees}C), 2) heat (32{degrees}C), and 3) cold (6{degrees}C). This experiment was replicated with B. psygmophilum cultured from O. arbuscula to characterize ex hospite symbiont responses. Both thermal challenges elicited classic environmental stress responses (ESRs) in O. arbuscula regardless of symbiotic state, with hosts responding more strongly to cold challenge. Hosts also exhibited stronger responses than in hospite symbionts. In and ex hospite B. psygmophilum both downregulated genes associated with photosynthesis under thermal challenge; however, ex hospite symbionts exhibited greater gene expression plasticity and differential expression of genes associated with ESRs. Taken together, these findings suggest that O. arbuscula hosts may buffer environments of B. psygmophilum symbionts; however, we outline the future work needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nA C-terminal HaloTag Impairs AGO2 Function\nAuthors: Shah, K. M.; Crozier, A. F. F.; Assaraf, A. A.; Arya, M.; Ribeiro, P. B.; Plevin, M. J.; Sharp, T. V.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567203\nA full understanding of RNA silencing requires appropriate molecular biology tools to explore the roles of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Commonly used approaches to study RNA silencing and RISC, such as those relying on affinity tagging and antibodies, have important limitations that can lead to artificial results. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of AGO2 have been shown to be important for correct activity and yet the consequences of appending tags to either terminus have not been fully investigated. N-terminal tags are frequently used to study AGO(2) biology. Recently, an N-terminal HaloTag-Ago2 fusion was reported and examined in mice. While the versatile HaloTag provided new opportunities to study RISC biology, the tagged construct showed certain activity changes compared to unmodified Ago2. CRISPaint, a new CRISPR-Cas9 technique, offers a route to the accurate and efficient generation of endogenous C-terminal tag fusions. Here, we used CRISPaint to generate the first reported recombinant AGO2 construct with a C-terminal tag: an endogenous C-terminal HaloTag fusion to AGO2 (AGO2HALO) in human (A549) cells. We found that the AGO2HALO fusion protein retains the capacity to interact with the key protein binding partner TNRC6A and that the C-terminal HaloTag does not affect cell viability. However, the AGO2HALO fusion significantly impairs RNA cleavage and RNA silencing activity compared to control cells, and reduces nuclear localisation of the fusion protein. We conclude that the fusion of a C-terminal HaloTag to AGO2 is not appropriate for studying AGO2 and RISC. Our results stress the importance of fully validating recombinant tagging strategies to ensure that any results generated do not obscure critical functional defects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In plants and mammals, non-homologous end-joining is the dominant pathway to repair DNA double strand breaks, making it challenging to generate knock-in events. Using a transient assay in Nicotiana benthamiana we identified two groups of exonucleases, respectively from the Herpes Virus and from the bacteriophage T7 families, hat confer up to 38-fold increase in HDR frequencies when fused to Cas9. We achieved precise and scar-free insertion of several kilobases of DNA both in transient and stable transformation systems. In Arabidopsis thaliana, fusion of Cas9 to a Herpes Virus family exonuclease leads to 10-fold higher frequencies of knock-ins. Our results open perspectives for the routine production of knock-in and gene replacement events in plants.

        <p class="abstract">Kidney injury disrupts the intricate renal architecture and triggers limited regeneration, and injury-invoked inflammation and fibrosis. Deciphering molecular pathways and cellular interactions driving these processes is challenging due to the complex renal architecture. Here, we applied single cell spatial transcriptomics to examine ischemia-reperfusion injury in the mouse kidney. Spatial transcriptomics revealed injury-specific and spatially-dependent gene expression patterns in distinct cellular microenvironments within the kidney and predicted Clcf1-Crfl1 in a molecular interplay between persistently injured proximal tubule cells and neighboring fibroblasts. Immune cell types play a critical role in organ repair. Spatial analysis revealed cellular microenvironments resembling early tertiary lymphoid structures and identified associated molecular pathways. Collectively, this study supports a focus on molecular interactions in cellular microenvironments to enhance understanding of injury, repair and disease.

        <p class="abstract">The orchestration of our genes heavily relies on a coordinated communication between enhancers and promoters, yet how this dynamic interplay remains elusive while transcription is active. Here, we investigated enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions and relative to transcriptional bursting in mouse embryonic stem cells using sequential DNA/RNA/immunofluorescence (IF)-FISH analyses and computational simulations. Our data reveal that the active state of specific genes is characterized by higher-order genomic structures and local condensates of transcriptional regulatory factors, leading to an elevation in local viscosity that highly stabilizes the duration of E-P interactions. Our study underscores the pivotal role of viscosity in transcriptional dynamics and paves the way for a more nuanced understanding of gene-specific regulatory mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">TnpB nucleases represent the evolutionary precursors to CRISPR-Cas12 and are widespread in all domains of life, presumably due to the critical roles they play in transposon proliferation. IS605-family TnpB homologs function in bacteria as programmable homing endonucleases by exploiting transposon-encoded guide RNAs to cleave vacant genomic sites, thereby driving transposon maintenance through DSB-stimulated homologous recombination. Whether this pathway is conserved in other genetic contexts, and in association with other transposases, is unknown. Here we uncover molecular mechanisms of transposition and RNA-guided DNA cleavage by IS607-family elements that, remarkably, also encode catalytic, self-splicing group I introns. After reconstituting and systematically investigating each of these biochemical activities for a candidate  IStron derived from Clostridium botulinum, we discovered sequence and structural features of the transposon-encoded RNA that satisfy molecular requirements of a group I intron and TnpB guide RNA, while still retaining the ability to be faithfully mobilized at the DNA level by the TnpA transposase. Strikingly, intron splicing was strongly repressed not only by TnpB, but also by the secondary structure of {omega}RNA alone, allowing the element to carefully control the relative levels of spliced products versus functional guide RNAs. Our results suggest that IStron transcripts have evolved a sensitive equilibrium to balance competing and mutually exclusive activities that promote transposon maintenance while limiting adverse fitness costs on the host. Collectively, this work explains how diverse enzymatic activities emerged during the selfish spread of IS607-family elements and highlights molecular innovation in the multi-functional utility of transposon-encoded noncoding RNAs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of synonymous codon choice on protein output has important implications for understanding endogenous gene expression and design of synthetic mRNAs. Previously, we used a neural network model to design a series of synonymous fluorescent reporters whose protein output in yeast spanned a seven-fold range corresponding to their predicted translation speed. Here, we show that this effect is not due primarily to the established impact of slow elongation on mRNA stability, but rather, that an active mechanism further decreases the number of proteins made per mRNA. We combine simulations and careful experiments on fluorescent reporters to argue that translation initiation is limited on non-optimally encoded transcripts. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to discover factors modulating the output from non-optimal transcripts, we identify a set of translation initiation factors including multiple subunits of eIF3 whose depletion restored protein output of a non-optimal reporter. Our results show that codon usage can directly limit protein production, across the full range of endogenous variability in codon usage, by limiting translation initiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Starvation and low carbohydrate diets lead to the accumulation of the ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), whose blood concentrations increase more than 10-fold into the millimolar range. In addition to providing a carbon source, BHB accumulation triggers lysine {beta}-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of proteins via unknown mechanisms. As with other lysine acylation events, Kbhb marks can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we report that class I HDACs unexpectedly catalyze protein lysine modification with {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Mutational analyses of the HDAC2 active site reveal a shared reliance on key amino acids for classical deacetylation and non-canonical HDAC-catalyzed {beta}-hydroxybutyrylation. Also consistent with reverse HDAC activity, Kbhb formation is driven by mass action and substrate availability. This reverse HDAC activity is not limited to BHB but also extends to multiple short-chain fatty acids. The reversible activity of class I HDACs described here represents a novel mechanism of PTM deposition relevant to metabolically-sensitive proteome modifications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Precise double-strand break (DSB) repair is paramount for genome stability. Homologous recombination (HR) repairs DSBs when cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is high, which correlates with the availability of the sister chromatid as a template. However, anaphase and telophase are paradoxical scenarios since high CDK favors HR despite sister chromatids being no longer aligned. To identify factors specifically involved in DSB repair in late mitosis, we have undertaken comparative proteomics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that Msc1, a poorly characterized nuclear envelope protein, is significantly enriched upon both random and guided DSBs. We further show that {Delta}msc1 is more sensitive to DSBs in late mitosis, and has a delayed repair of DBSs, as indicated by increased Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, fewer Rad52 repair factories, and slower HR completion. We discuss how Msc1 may favor the formation of Rad52 factories and the timely completion of HR before cytokinesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transcription elongation is stochastic and driven by a Brownian ratchet mechanism, making it subject to changes in velocity. However, on regions occupied by multiple polymerases, notably the rDNA, DNA rotation plus torsion constrain polymerase molecules to proceed at the same rate generating &#34;torsional entrainment&#34;. We report that release of entrainment, by co-transcriptional 3-end cleavage, is permissive for relative movement between polymerases, promoting pausing and backtracking. Subsequent termination (polymerase release) is facilitated by the 5-exonuclease Rat1 (Xrn2) and backtracked transcript cleavage by RNAPI subunit Rpa12. These activities were reproduced in vitro. Short nascent transcripts close to the transcriptional start site, combined with nascent transcript folding energy, similarly facilitate RNAPI pausing. Nascent, backtracked transcripts at pause sites, are targeted by both the exosome cofactor TRAMP and Rat1, promoting termination. Topoisomerase 2 localizes adjacent to RNAPI pause sites, potentially allowing continued elongation by downstream polymerases. Biophysical modeling supported substantial ([~]10%) premature termination.

HighlightsNascent pre-rRNA 3 cleavage promotes RNAPI deceleration and termination RNAPI undergoes early, start-site proximal termination at sites of polymerase pausing Biophysical modeling indicates [~]10% early termination - or [~]100 events per minute Model presented for overall organization of pre-rRNA transcription</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increasing ocean temperatures are causing dysbiosis between coral hosts and their symbionts. Previous work suggests that coral host gene expression responds more strongly to environmental stress compared to their intracellular symbionts; however, the causes and consequences of this phenomenon remain untested. We hypothesized that symbionts are less responsive because hosts modulate symbiont environments to buffer stress. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged the facultative symbiosis between the scleractinian coral Oculina arbuscula and its symbiont Breviolum psygmophilum to characterize gene expression responses of both symbiotic partners in and ex hospite under thermal challenges. To characterize host and in hospite symbiont responses, symbiotic and aposymbiotic O. arbuscula were exposed to three treatments: 1) control (18{degrees}C), 2) heat (32{degrees}C), and 3) cold (6{degrees}C). This experiment was replicated with B. psygmophilum cultured from O. arbuscula to characterize ex hospite symbiont responses. Both thermal challenges elicited classic environmental stress responses (ESRs) in O. arbuscula regardless of symbiotic state, with hosts responding more strongly to cold challenge. Hosts also exhibited stronger responses than in hospite symbionts. In and ex hospite B. psygmophilum both downregulated genes associated with photosynthesis under thermal challenge; however, ex hospite symbionts exhibited greater gene expression plasticity and differential expression of genes associated with ESRs. Taken together, these findings suggest that O. arbuscula hosts may buffer environments of B. psygmophilum symbionts; however, we outline the future work needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A full understanding of RNA silencing requires appropriate molecular biology tools to explore the roles of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Commonly used approaches to study RNA silencing and RISC, such as those relying on affinity tagging and antibodies, have important limitations that can lead to artificial results. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of AGO2 have been shown to be important for correct activity and yet the consequences of appending tags to either terminus have not been fully investigated. N-terminal tags are frequently used to study AGO(2) biology. Recently, an N-terminal HaloTag-Ago2 fusion was reported and examined in mice. While the versatile HaloTag provided new opportunities to study RISC biology, the tagged construct showed certain activity changes compared to unmodified Ago2. CRISPaint, a new CRISPR-Cas9 technique, offers a route to the accurate and efficient generation of endogenous C-terminal tag fusions. Here, we used CRISPaint to generate the first reported recombinant AGO2 construct with a C-terminal tag: an endogenous C-terminal HaloTag fusion to AGO2 (AGO2HALO) in human (A549) cells. We found that the AGO2HALO fusion protein retains the capacity to interact with the key protein binding partner TNRC6A and that the C-terminal HaloTag does not affect cell viability. However, the AGO2HALO fusion significantly impairs RNA cleavage and RNA silencing activity compared to control cells, and reduces nuclear localisation of the fusion protein. We conclude that the fusion of a C-terminal HaloTag to AGO2 is not appropriate for studying AGO2 and RISC. Our results stress the importance of fully validating recombinant tagging strategies to ensure that any results generated do not obscure critical functional defects.</p>
