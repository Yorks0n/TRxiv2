We here show that nanopore shotgun sequencing can robustly assess the air microbiome in combination with active air sampling through liquid impingement and tailored computational analysis. We provide laboratory and computational protocols for air microbiome profiling, and reliably assess the taxonomic composition of the core air microbiome in controlled and natural environments. Based on de novo assemblies from the long sequencing reads, we further identify the taxa of several air microbiota down to the species level and annotate their ecosystem functions, including their potential role in natural biodegradation processes. As air monitoring by nanopore sequencing can be employed in an automatable, fast, and portable manner for in situ applications all around the world, we envision that this approach can help holistically explore the role of the air microbiome.\nRapid DNA unwinding accelerates genome editing by engineered CRISPR-Cas9\nAuthors: Eggers, A. R.; Chen, K.; Soczek, K. M.; Tuck, O. T.; Doherty, E. E.; Thornton, B. W.; Xu, B.; Trinidad, M. I.; Doudna, J. A.\nScore: 32.9, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571777\nThermostable CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes could improve genome editing efficiency and delivery due to extended protein lifetimes. However, initial experimentation demonstrated Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9 (GeoCas9) to be virtually inactive when used in cultured human cells. Laboratory-evolved variants of GeoCas9 overcome this natural limitation by acquiring mutations in the wedge (WED) domain that produce \u003e100-fold higher genome editing levels. Cryo-EM structures of the wildtype and improved GeoCas9 (iGeoCas9) enzymes reveal extended contacts between the WED domain of iGeoCas9 and DNA substrates. Biochemical analysis shows that iGeoCas9 accelerates DNA unwinding to capture substrates under the magnesium-restricted conditions typical of mammalian but not bacterial cells. These findings enabled rational engineering of other Cas9 orthologs to enhance genome editing levels, pointing to a general strategy for editing enzyme improvement. Together, these results uncover a new role for the Cas9 WED domain in DNA unwinding and demonstrate how accelerated target unwinding dramatically improves Cas9-induced genome editing activity.\nSTOPGAP, an open-source package for template matching, subtomogram alignment, and classification\nAuthors: Wan, W.; Khavnekar, S.; Wagner, J.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572665\nCryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables molecular-resolution 3D imaging of complex biological specimens such as viral particles, cellular sections, and in some cases, whole cells. This enables the structural characterization of molecules in their near-native environments, without the need for purification or separation, thereby preserving biological information such as conformational states and spatial relationships between different molecular species. Subtomogram averaging is an image processing workflow that allows users to leverage cryo-ET data to identify and localize target molecules, determine high-resolution structures of repeating molecular species, and classifying different conformational states. Here we describe STOPGAP, an open-source package for subtomogram averaging designed to provide users with fine control over each of these steps. In providing detailed descriptions of the image processing algorithms that STOPGAP uses, we intend for this manuscript to also serve as a technical resource to users as well as further community-driven software development.\nSMC motor proteins extrude DNA asymmetrically and contain a direction switch\nAuthors: Barth, R.; Davidson, I.; van der Torre, J.; Taschner, M.; Gruber, S.; Peters, J.-M.; Dekker, C.\nScore: 17.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572892\nStructural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes organize the genome via DNA loop extrusion. While some SMCs were reported to do so symmetrically, reeling DNA from both sides into the extruded DNA loop simultaneously, others perform loop extrusion asymmetrically toward one direction only. The mechanism underlying this variability remains unclear. Here, we examine the directionality of DNA loop extrusion by SMCs using in vitro single-molecule experiments. We find that cohesin and SMC5/6 do not reel in DNA from both sides, as reported before, but instead extrude DNA asymmetrically, while the direction can switch over time. Asymmetric DNA loop extrusion thus is the shared mechanism across all eukaryotic SMC complexes. For cohesin, direction switches strongly correlate with the turnover of the subunit NIPBL, during which DNA strand switching may occur. STAG1 stabilizes NIPBL on cohesin, preventing NIPBL turnover and direction switches. The findings reveal that SMCs, surprisingly, contain a direction switch subunit. HighlightsO_LIAll eukaryotic SMC complexes extrude DNA asymmetrically. C_LIO_LIApparent symmetric loop extrusion is the result of frequent direction switches. C_LIO_LIn human cohesin, loop-extrusion direction changes require exchange of NIPBL. C_LIO_LISTAG1 stabilizes NIPBL on human cohesin.

The unique zinc-finger domain, zf-4CXXC_R1, of CDCA7 is widely conserved across eukaryotes but is absent from species that lack HELLS and DNA methyltransferases, implying its specialized relation with methylated DNA. Here we demonstrate that zf-4CXXC_R1 acts as a hemimethylated DNA sensor. The zf-4CXXC_R1 domain of CDCA7 selectively binds to DNA with a hemimethylated CpG, but not unmethylated or fully methylated CpG, and ICF disease mutations eliminated this binding. CDCA7 and HELLS interact via their N-terminal alpha helices, through which HELLS is recruited to hemimethylated DNA. While placement of a hemimethylated CpG within the nucleosome core particle can hinder its recognition by CDCA7, cryo-EM structure analysis of the CDCA7-nucleosome complex suggests that zf-4CXXC_R1 recognizes a hemimethylated CpG in the major groove at linker DNA. Our study provides insights into how the CDCA7-HELLS nucleosome remodeling complex uniquely assists maintenance DNA methylation.\nConcerted SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase activities of TOPORS and RNF4 are essential for stress management and cell proliferation\nAuthors: Liu, J.

In genome-scale screens, we identified the human E3 ligase TOPORS as a key effector of SUMO-dependent DPC resolution. We demonstrate that TOPORS promotes DPC repair by functioning as a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) for DPCs, combining ubiquitin ligase activity through its RING domain with poly-SUMO chain binding via a cluster of SUMO-interacting motifs, analogous to the STUbL RNF4. Surprisingly, the STUbL activities of TOPORS and RNF4 are both required for SUMO-dependent DPC repair, PML degradation and other stress responses, making overlapping and distinct contributions to ubiquitin chain formation on SUMOylated targets to enable p97/VCP unfoldase recruitment. Combined loss of TOPORS and RNF4 is synthetic lethal even in unstressed cells, leading to defective clearance of SUMOylated proteins from chromatin accompanied by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Together, our findings establish TOPORS as a novel STUbL whose concerted action with RNF4 defines a general mechanistic principle in crucial cellular processes governed by direct SUMO-ubiquitin crosstalk.

C. D.; Popp, P. F.; Roa-Eguiara, A.; Martin, F. J. O.; Rutbeek, N. R.; Hendriks, I. A.; Payne, L. J.; Yan, Y.; Sousa, V. K. d.; Wang, Y.; Nielsen, M. L.; Berry, R. M.; Erhardt, M.; Jackson, S. A.; Taylor, N. M. I.\nScore: 67.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572097\nZorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system, which protects against phage invasion. It consists of a predicted membrane-embedded complex (ZorAB) and soluble components that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD, in type I Zorya systems. Here, we reveal the molecular basis of the Zorya defense system using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We demonstrate that ZorAB shares the stoichiometry of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. Additionally, ZorA5B2 features a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric -helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 700 [A] into the cytoplasm. We further characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, and find that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrates that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We present evidence that ZorAB operates as an ion-driven motor that becomes activated and anchors to the cell wall upon sensing of cell envelope perturbations during phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to the soluble effectors, which function to prevent phage propagation. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function and reveals a novel triggering signal for the rapid activation of an anti-phage defense system.\nRNA 5' terminal nucleotide determines the strength of the RIG-I/IFN signaling pathway\nAuthors: Wolczyk, M.; Szymanski, J.; Trus, I.; Naz, Z.; Bolembach, A.; Choudhury, N. R.; Tame, T.; Konuc, C.; Nowak, E.; Spanos, C.; Rappsilber, J.; Michlewski, G.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573000\nThe interferon (IFN) response is crucial for antiviral activity, but its overstimulation can lead to a wide range of autoimmune disorders. The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I detects viral RNAs and endogenous polymerase III transcripts carrying a 5'-triphosphate (5'- ppp) or 5'-diphosphate (5'-pp) moiety, triggering an IFN immune response. While many viral RNAs initiate with 5'-ppp-adenosine (5'-pppA) and most endogenous Pol III transcripts in higher eukaryotes start with 5'-ppp-guanosine (5'-pppG), no apparent reason for this bias has been identified so far. Here we demonstrate that RNAs initiating with 5'-pppA trigger a much stronger RIG-I/IFN response than those starting with 5'-pppG. The structures of the matching RNA pairs have been confirmed to be similar, suggesting that functional differences in RIG-I/IFN pathway stimulation cannot be primarily explained by an altered conformation. We show that several GTP-binding proteins interact with 5'-pppG RNAs creating a steric hindrance and protecting these RNAs from activating RIG-I. Our findings suggest that 5'-pppG RNAs may allow some RNA viruses and Pol III transcripts to evade detection by cellular immune sensors. These results provide a new insight into the mechanism of sequence-dependent RIG-I/IFN pathway activation and have significant implications for understanding the antiviral response to RNA viruses and the contribution of Pol III-derived RNAs to autoimmune disorders.\nThe V-ATPase/ATG16L1 axis is controlled by the V1H subunit\nAuthors: Timimi, L.; Wrobel, A. G.; Chiduza, G. N.; Maslen, S. L.; Torres-Mendez, A.; Montaner, B.; Davis, C.; Skehel, M.; Rubinstein, J. L.; Schreiber, A. L.; Beale, R.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572309\nDefects in organellar acidification indicate compromised or infected compartments. Recruitment of the autophagy-related ATG16L1 complex to pathologically de-acidified compartments targets ubiquitin-like ATG8 molecules to perturbed membranes. How this process is coupled to pH gradient disruption is unclear. Here, we reveal a direct role for the V1H subunit of the V-ATPase proton pump in recruiting ATG16L1. The interaction between V1H and ATG16L1 occurs within assembled V-ATPases, but not dissociated V1 complexes. This selectivity allows recruitment to be coupled to changes in V-ATPase assembly that follow pH dissipation. Cells lacking V1H undergo canonical macroautophagy but are unable to recruit ATG16L1 in response to influenza infection or ionophore drugs. We identify a loop within V1H that mediates ATG16L1 binding, which is absent in a neuronal isoform of V1H. Thus, V1H controls ATG16L1 recruitment in response to proton gradient dissipation, suggesting that the V-ATPase acts autonomously as a cell-intrinsic damage sensor.\nHigh order expression dependencies finely resolve cryptic states and subtypes in single cell data\nAuthors: Jansma, A.; Yao, Y.; Wolfe, J.; Del Debbio, L.; Beentjes, S. V.; Ponting, C. P.; Khamseh, A.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572232\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSingle cells are typically typed by clustering in reduced dimensional transcriptome space. Here we introduce Stator, a novel method, workflow and app that reveals cell types, subtypes and states without relying on local proximity of cells in gene expression space. Rather, Stator derives higher-order gene expression dependencies from a sparse gene-by-cell expression matrix. From these dependencies the method multiply labels the same single cell according to type, sub-type and state (activation, differentiation or cell cycle sub-phase). By applying the method to data from mouse embryonic brain, and human healthy or diseased liver, we show how Stator first recapitulates other methods cell type labels, and then reveals combinatorial gene expression markers of cell type, state, and disease at higher resolution. By allowing multiple state labels for single cells we reveal cell type fates of embryonic progenitor cells and liver cancer states associated with patient survival.\n",

        <p class="abstract">While the air microbiome and its diversity are known to be essential for human health and ecosystem resilience, the current lack of holistic air microbial diversity monitoring means that little is known about the air microbiomes composition, distribution, or functional effects. We here show that nanopore shotgun sequencing can robustly assess the air microbiome in combination with active air sampling through liquid impingement and tailored computational analysis. We provide laboratory and computational protocols for air microbiome profiling, and reliably assess the taxonomic composition of the core air microbiome in controlled and natural environments. Based on de novo assemblies from the long sequencing reads, we further identify the taxa of several air microbiota down to the species level and annotate their ecosystem functions, including their potential role in natural biodegradation processes. As air monitoring by nanopore sequencing can be employed in an automatable, fast, and portable manner for in situ applications all around the world, we envision that this approach can help holistically explore the role of the air microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermostable CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes could improve genome editing efficiency and delivery due to extended protein lifetimes. However, initial experimentation demonstrated Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9 (GeoCas9) to be virtually inactive when used in cultured human cells. Laboratory-evolved variants of GeoCas9 overcome this natural limitation by acquiring mutations in the wedge (WED) domain that produce &gt;100-fold higher genome editing levels. Cryo-EM structures of the wildtype and improved GeoCas9 (iGeoCas9) enzymes reveal extended contacts between the WED domain of iGeoCas9 and DNA substrates. Biochemical analysis shows that iGeoCas9 accelerates DNA unwinding to capture substrates under the magnesium-restricted conditions typical of mammalian but not bacterial cells. These findings enabled rational engineering of other Cas9 orthologs to enhance genome editing levels, pointing to a general strategy for editing enzyme improvement. Together, these results uncover a new role for the Cas9 WED domain in DNA unwinding and demonstrate how accelerated target unwinding dramatically improves Cas9-induced genome editing activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables molecular-resolution 3D imaging of complex biological specimens such as viral particles, cellular sections, and in some cases, whole cells. This enables the structural characterization of molecules in their near-native environments, without the need for purification or separation, thereby preserving biological information such as conformational states and spatial relationships between different molecular species. Subtomogram averaging is an image processing workflow that allows users to leverage cryo-ET data to identify and localize target molecules, determine high-resolution structures of repeating molecular species, and classifying different conformational states. Here we describe STOPGAP, an open-source package for subtomogram averaging designed to provide users with fine control over each of these steps. In providing detailed descriptions of the image processing algorithms that STOPGAP uses, we intend for this manuscript to also serve as a technical resource to users as well as further community-driven software development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes organize the genome via DNA loop extrusion. While some SMCs were reported to do so symmetrically, reeling DNA from both sides into the extruded DNA loop simultaneously, others perform loop extrusion asymmetrically toward one direction only. The mechanism underlying this variability remains unclear. Here, we examine the directionality of DNA loop extrusion by SMCs using in vitro single-molecule experiments. We find that cohesin and SMC5/6 do not reel in DNA from both sides, as reported before, but instead extrude DNA asymmetrically, while the direction can switch over time. Asymmetric DNA loop extrusion thus is the shared mechanism across all eukaryotic SMC complexes. For cohesin, direction switches strongly correlate with the turnover of the subunit NIPBL, during which DNA strand switching may occur. STAG1 stabilizes NIPBL on cohesin, preventing NIPBL turnover and direction switches. The findings reveal that SMCs, surprisingly, contain a direction switch subunit.

        <p class="abstract">Mutations of the SNF2 family ATPase HELLS and its activator CDCA7 cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, characterized by hypomethylation at heterochromatin. The unique zinc-finger domain, zf-4CXXC_R1, of CDCA7 is widely conserved across eukaryotes but is absent from species that lack HELLS and DNA methyltransferases, implying its specialized relation with methylated DNA. Here we demonstrate that zf-4CXXC_R1 acts as a hemimethylated DNA sensor. The zf-4CXXC_R1 domain of CDCA7 selectively binds to DNA with a hemimethylated CpG, but not unmethylated or fully methylated CpG, and ICF disease mutations eliminated this binding. CDCA7 and HELLS interact via their N-terminal alpha helices, through which HELLS is recruited to hemimethylated DNA. While placement of a hemimethylated CpG within the nucleosome core particle can hinder its recognition by CDCA7, cryo-EM structure analysis of the CDCA7-nucleosome complex suggests that zf-4CXXC_R1 recognizes a hemimethylated CpG in the major groove at linker DNA. Our study provides insights into how the CDCA7-HELLS nucleosome remodeling complex uniquely assists maintenance DNA methylation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein SUMOylation provides a principal driving force for cellular stress responses including DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) repair and arsenic-induced PML body degradation. In genome-scale screens, we identified the human E3 ligase TOPORS as a key effector of SUMO-dependent DPC resolution. We demonstrate that TOPORS promotes DPC repair by functioning as a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) for DPCs, combining ubiquitin ligase activity through its RING domain with poly-SUMO chain binding via a cluster of SUMO-interacting motifs, analogous to the STUbL RNF4. Surprisingly, the STUbL activities of TOPORS and RNF4 are both required for SUMO-dependent DPC repair, PML degradation and other stress responses, making overlapping and distinct contributions to ubiquitin chain formation on SUMOylated targets to enable p97/VCP unfoldase recruitment. Combined loss of TOPORS and RNF4 is synthetic lethal even in unstressed cells, leading to defective clearance of SUMOylated proteins from chromatin accompanied by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Together, our findings establish TOPORS as a novel STUbL whose concerted action with RNF4 defines a general mechanistic principle in crucial cellular processes governed by direct SUMO-ubiquitin crosstalk.

        <p class="abstract">Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system, which protects against phage invasion. It consists of a predicted membrane-embedded complex (ZorAB) and soluble components that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD, in type I Zorya systems. Here, we reveal the molecular basis of the Zorya defense system using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We demonstrate that ZorAB shares the stoichiometry of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. Additionally, ZorA5B2 features a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric -helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 700 [A] into the cytoplasm. We further characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, and find that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrates that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We present evidence that ZorAB operates as an ion-driven motor that becomes activated and anchors to the cell wall upon sensing of cell envelope perturbations during phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to the soluble effectors, which function to prevent phage propagation. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function and reveals a novel triggering signal for the rapid activation of an anti-phage defense system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The interferon (IFN) response is crucial for antiviral activity, but its overstimulation can lead to a wide range of autoimmune disorders. The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I detects viral RNAs and endogenous polymerase III transcripts carrying a 5&#39;-triphosphate (5&#39;- ppp) or 5&#39;-diphosphate (5&#39;-pp) moiety, triggering an IFN immune response. While many viral RNAs initiate with 5&#39;-ppp-adenosine (5&#39;-pppA) and most endogenous Pol III transcripts in higher eukaryotes start with 5&#39;-ppp-guanosine (5&#39;-pppG), no apparent reason for this bias has been identified so far. Here we demonstrate that RNAs initiating with 5&#39;-pppA trigger a much stronger RIG-I/IFN response than those starting with 5&#39;-pppG. The structures of the matching RNA pairs have been confirmed to be similar, suggesting that functional differences in RIG-I/IFN pathway stimulation cannot be primarily explained by an altered conformation. We show that several GTP-binding proteins interact with 5&#39;-pppG RNAs creating a steric hindrance and protecting these RNAs from activating RIG-I. Our findings suggest that 5&#39;-pppG RNAs may allow some RNA viruses and Pol III transcripts to evade detection by cellular immune sensors. These results provide a new insight into the mechanism of sequence-dependent RIG-I/IFN pathway activation and have significant implications for understanding the antiviral response to RNA viruses and the contribution of Pol III-derived RNAs to autoimmune disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Defects in organellar acidification indicate compromised or infected compartments. Recruitment of the autophagy-related ATG16L1 complex to pathologically de-acidified compartments targets ubiquitin-like ATG8 molecules to perturbed membranes. How this process is coupled to pH gradient disruption is unclear. Here, we reveal a direct role for the V1H subunit of the V-ATPase proton pump in recruiting ATG16L1. The interaction between V1H and ATG16L1 occurs within assembled V-ATPases, but not dissociated V1 complexes. This selectivity allows recruitment to be coupled to changes in V-ATPase assembly that follow pH dissipation. Cells lacking V1H undergo canonical macroautophagy but are unable to recruit ATG16L1 in response to influenza infection or ionophore drugs. We identify a loop within V1H that mediates ATG16L1 binding, which is absent in a neuronal isoform of V1H. Thus, V1H controls ATG16L1 recruitment in response to proton gradient dissipation, suggesting that the V-ATPase acts autonomously as a cell-intrinsic damage sensor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSingle cells are typically typed by clustering in reduced dimensional transcriptome space. Here we introduce Stator, a novel method, workflow and app that reveals cell types, subtypes and states without relying on local proximity of cells in gene expression space. Rather, Stator derives higher-order gene expression dependencies from a sparse gene-by-cell expression matrix. From these dependencies the method multiply labels the same single cell according to type, sub-type and state (activation, differentiation or cell cycle sub-phase). By applying the method to data from mouse embryonic brain, and human healthy or diseased liver, we show how Stator first recapitulates other methods cell type labels, and then reveals combinatorial gene expression markers of cell type, state, and disease at higher resolution. By allowing multiple state labels for single cells we reveal cell type fates of embryonic progenitor cells and liver cancer states associated with patient survival.</p>
