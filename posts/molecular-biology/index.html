P.; Polo, J. M.; Davidovich, C.\nScore: 60.9, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553488\nRNA has been implicated in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers, and previous studies have provided evidence in favour and against this idea. RNase treatment of chromatin is a prevalent tool for the study of RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin modifiers, but the limitations of this approach remain unclear. One of the most studied chromatin modifiers in the context of RNA-mediated regulation is the H3K27me3 methyltransferase Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). RNase A treatment during chromatin immunoprecipitation (RNase-ChIP or rChIP) reduces the occupancy of PRC2 on chromatin. This led to suggestions of an \"RNA bridge\" between PRC2 and chromatin. Here we show that RNase A treatment during chromatin immunoprecipitation leads to the apparent loss of all facultative heterochromatin, including both PRC2 and its H3K27me3 mark genome wide. This phenomenon persists in mouse embryonic stem cells, human cancer cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We track this observation to a global gain of chromatin that artificially reduces ChIP signals from facultative heterochromatin during normalisation. Our results point to substantial limitations in using RNase A treatment for mapping RNA-dependent chromatin occupancy and invalidate conclusions that were previously established for PRC2 based on this assay.\nMolecular mechanism of dynein-dynactin activation by JIP3 and LIS1\nAuthors: Singh, K.; Lau, C.; Manigrasso, G.; Gama, J. B.; Gassmann, R.; Carter, A. P.\nScore: 54.4, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.17.504273\nMicrotubule motors, like cytoplasmic dynein-1, are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activity in cells. Dynein functions as a [~]4 MDa complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognise diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as LIS1 remain unclear. To address this, we determine the cryo-EM structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. We show how JIP3 specifies complex formation despite a shorter coiled coil and lack of identifiable motifs compared to typical adaptors. We find LIS1 directly binds dynactins p150 subunit, closely tethering it to dynein. This interaction is necessary for dyneins cellular and in vitro activity. We also show how dyneins intermediate chain relieves p150s autoinhibition to enable LIS1 binding. Together, our data suggest LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.\nApparent RNA bridging between PRC2 and chromatin is an artefact of non-specific chromatin precipitation upon RNA degradation\nAuthors: Hickman, A. H.; Jenner, R. G.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553503\nPolycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) modifies chromatin to maintain repression of genes specific for other cell lineages and is essential for development. In vitro, RNA inhibits PRC2 catalytic activity and interaction with nucleosomes but the effect of RNA on PRC2 in cells has been unclear, with studies concluding that RNA either antagonises or promotes the association of PRC2 with chromatin. The addition of RNase A to chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions has been reported to reduce detection of PRC2 target sites, suggesting the existence of an RNA bridge that connects PRC2 to chromatin. Here, we show that this apparent loss of PRC2 chromatin association after RNase A treatment is due to non-specific chromatin precipitation. RNA degradation causes chromatin to precipitate out of solution, thereby reducing the enrichment of specific DNA sequences in chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions. Maintaining chromatin solubility by the addition of poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) rescues detection of PRC2 chromatin association upon RNA degradation. These findings undermine support for the model that RNA bridges PRC2 and chromatin in cells.\nHighly multiplexed mRNA quantitation with CRISPR-Cas13\nAuthors: Kang, B.; Zhang, J.; Schwoerer, M. P.; Nelson, A. N.; Schoeman, E.; Ploss, A.; Myhrvold, C.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553527\nRNA quantitation tools are often either high-throughput or cost-effective, but rarely are they both. Existing methods can profile the transcriptome at great expense or are limited to quantifying a handful of genes by labor constraints. A technique that permits more throughput at a reduced cost could enable multi-gene kinetic studies, gene regulatory network analysis, and combinatorial genetic screens. Here, we introduce quantitative Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (qCARMEN): an RNA quantitation technique which leverages the programmable RNA-targeting capabilities of CRISPR-Cas13 to address this challenge by quantifying over 4,500 gene-sample pairs in a single experiment. Using qCARMEN, we studied the response profiles of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during interferon (IFN) stimulation and flavivirus infection. Additionally, we observed isoform switching kinetics during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. qCARMEN is a simple and inexpensive technique that greatly enhances the scalability of RNA quantitation for novel applications with performance similar to gold-standard methods.\nTazobactam selects for multidrug resistance\nAuthors: Holden, E. R.; Yasir, M.; Turner, A. K.; Charles, I. G.; Webber, M. A.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553388\nPiperacillin-Tazobactam is a {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combination which is amongst the most prescribed antimicrobials in hospital medicine. Piperacillin is inactivated by commonly carried resistance enzymes, but tazobactam inhibits these allowing successful treatment. The effect of piperacillin on Gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the effects of tazobactam. We used a massive transposon mutagenesis approach (TraDIS-Xpress) to determine the genes in Escherichia coli that affect survival when exposed to piperacillin and tazobactam, separately and together. We found significant differences in the selective pressure of the two drugs: a striking finding was that multiple efflux pump families and regulators were essential for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but only one efflux system was beneficial for piperacillin. Additionally, we identified the shikimate kinase AroK as a potential target for tazobactam. This method also found that genes involved in DNA replication and repair reduced E. coli susceptibility to a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, not seen from either drug treatment alone. Treatment of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with piperacillin and/or tazobactam selected for mutants with reduced susceptibility, and SNP analyses supported the TraDIS-Xpress findings that tazobactam selects for changes in membrane permeability and maintenance associated with multidrug-resistance. Increased efflux activity is an important foundation of multidrug resistance in human pathogens, therefore the finding that tazobactam can select for this is concerning. These findings could have consequences for antibiotic prescription and should inform the development of future {beta}-lactamase inhibitors to reduce the global increase in multidrug-resistant infections.\nMutual homeostasis of charged proteins\nAuthors: Faraway, R.; Heaven, N. C.; Digby, H.; Wilkins, O. G.; Chakrabarti, A. M.; Iosub, I. A.; Knez, L.; Ameres, S. L.; Plaschka, C.; Ule, J.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554177\nProtein dosage is regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis and health. The dosage of proteins containing disordered low complexity domains (LCDs) must be particularly well-controlled to prevent aberrant disease, yet no mechanism to maintain homeostasis has been identified. Here we report a mutual homeostatic mechanism that controls the concentration of such proteins, termed 'interstasis', in which proteins with similar LCDs co-regulate their combined dosage through collective negative feedback. We focused on the mechanism that exploits the fundamental multivalency of GA-rich RNA regions that encode charged LCDs, including those with arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs). Modest variations in the abundance of an R-MCD protein change the properties of nuclear speckles, a protein-RNA condensate, selectively trapping multivalent GA-rich mRNAs to promote their nuclear retention. This interstasis depends on conserved codon biases, shared by Amniotes, which enhance the multivalency of GA-rich regions encoding charged LCDs. The threshold of interstasis is modulated by CLK kinases, which affect the nuclear speckle localisation of proteins such as TRA2B, key binder of GA-rich RNAs. Notably, many classes of LCDs are encoded by RNA regions containing multivalency-enhancing codon biases, each preferentially bound by specific proteins, suggesting that interstasis might co-regulate many classes of functionally related LCD-containing proteins through dose-sensitivity of various types of protein-RNA condensates.\nAn anciently diverged family of RNA binding proteins maintain correct splicing of ultra-long exons through cryptic splice site repression.\nAuthors: Siachisumo, C.; Luzzi, S.; Aldalaqan, S.; Hysenaj, G.; Dalgliesh, C.; Cheung, K.; Gazzara, M. R.; Yonchev, I. D.; James, K.; Kheirollahi Chadegani, M.; Ehrmann, I. E.; Smith, G. R.; Cockell, S. J.; Munkley, J.; wilson, s. a.; Barash, Y.; Elliott, D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553384\nWe previously showed that the germ cell specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility. It has remained unknown whether RBMXL2 evolved its role in splicing repression to deal with the transcriptionally permissive environment of meiosis or might fulfil a function required in all cells. RBMXL2 evolved from the X-linked RBMX gene, which is silenced during meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. Here we find that like RBMXL2, RBMX primarily operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells, and specifically regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and RBMX represses the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. These similarities in overall function suggested that RBMXL2 during meiosis might replace the otherwise ubiquitous RBMX protein. To test this prediction we carried out inducible expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing in response to RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMXL2 replaces RBMX during meiosis, and these proteins have maintained parallel roles that must have been conserved over at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are important for the splicing inclusion of ultra-long exons because these are particularly susceptible to disruption by cryptic splice site selection.\nDeep screening of proximal and distal splicing-regulatory elements in a native sequence context\nAuthors: Recinos, Y.; Ustianenko, D.; Yeh, Y.-T.; Wang, X.; Jacko, M.; Yesantharao, L. V.; Wu, Q.; Zhang, C.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554109\nPre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is impeded by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically dead CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identified not only known SREs, but also a novel distal intronic splicing enhancer, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.\nBMP7 promotes cardiomyocyte regeneration\nAuthors: Bongiovanni, C.; Bueno-Levy, H.; Posadas Pena, S. D.; Del Bono, I.; Redaelli, S.; Bergen, M.; Da Pra, S.; Sacchi, F.; Miano, C.; Boriati, S.; Pontis, F.; Romaniello, D.; Mazzeschi, M.; Petraroia, I.; Tassinari, R.; Kellerer, L.; Lauriola, M.; Ventura, C.; Heermann, S.; Weidinger, G.; Tzahor, E.; D'Uva, G.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553475\nZebrafish has a remarkable and lifelong ability for cardiac regeneration after severe damage, whereas mammals lose their innate capacity for heart regeneration during early postnatal development. This study aimed to investigate whether the decreased production of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle and the reduction in cardiac regenerative ability. We identified growth factors with declining expression levels during early postnatal life in the mouse model and assessed the pro-proliferative ability of these factors on neonatal murine primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our findings confirmed the previously reported pro-proliferative effects of NRG1, IL1b, RANKL, IGF2 and IL6, while also identifying novel potential pro-regenerative growth factors. Among them, BMP7 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy. Bmp7 knockdown interfered with the proliferation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture and adult bmp7 mutant zebrafish displayed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression was sufficient to boost cardiomyocyte cycling in regenerating zebrafish hearts, while BMP7 administration stimulated mouse cardiomyocyte cycling at postnatal-day-7, when cardiomyocytes ceased to proliferate, and enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo in adult mice following myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, BMP7-induced proliferation was mediated by type I BMP receptors BMPR1A and ACVR1, and type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. Downstream signalling involved SMAD5, ERK and AKT. In conclusion, the administration of BMP7 holds promise as a strategy to stimulate heart regeneration following cardiac injury.\nGene editing in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus by Cas9-mediated ReMOT Control\nAuthors: Lima, L.; Berni, M.; Mota, J.; Bressan, D.; Julio, A.; Cavalcante, R.; Macias, V.; Li, Z.; Rasgon, J. L.; Bier, E.; Araujo, H. M.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553172\nRhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Despite the broad use of double-stranded RNA interference for the knockdown of gene function in R. prolixus, transgenesis and gene editing protocols are still lacking. Here we tested Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) and direct parental injection of CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) for the maternal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes, and strategies for the identification of insertions/deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited G0 nymphs. We demonstrate successful ReMOT Control-mediated gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof-of-concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germline edited lines in triatomines. Our studies also suggest that optimal strategies for recovery of mutations include performing multiple gRNA injections and the use of visible phenotypes such as those displayed in the Rp-scarlet, Rp-white and Rp-yellow loci for future Co-CRISPR experiments. These results will lay the foundation for gene editing protocols for triatomines and could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease. Author SummaryRhodnius prolixus is an insect vector of the protozoan Trypanossoma cruzi, causative agent of debilitating Chagas disease. To fight the spread of the disease, it has been suggested that biological control of the insect should be attempted. Gene editing by the novel CRISPR methodology holds great promise in this sense, as it enables to target almost any gene in the genome for mutagenesis, thus allowing the control of insect physiology and reproduction. Here we have tested protocols for the delivery of CRISPR reagents as an attempt to enable genome editing of the vector. Our results show that maternal delivery of CRISPR by the ReMOT Control method is efficient for mutating eye and cuticle color genes in the resulting nymphs, generating edited animals with red eyes, white eyes or a yellow cuticle. This is the first report of gene editing in a vector of Chagas disease and should lay the basis to produce modified animals either unable to carry the T. cruzi parasite or to reproduce.\n",

        <p class="abstract">RNA has been implicated in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers, and previous studies have provided evidence in favour and against this idea. RNase treatment of chromatin is a prevalent tool for the study of RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin modifiers, but the limitations of this approach remain unclear. One of the most studied chromatin modifiers in the context of RNA-mediated regulation is the H3K27me3 methyltransferase Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). RNase A treatment during chromatin immunoprecipitation (RNase-ChIP or rChIP) reduces the occupancy of PRC2 on chromatin. This led to suggestions of an &#34;RNA bridge&#34; between PRC2 and chromatin. Here we show that RNase A treatment during chromatin immunoprecipitation leads to the apparent loss of all facultative heterochromatin, including both PRC2 and its H3K27me3 mark genome wide. This phenomenon persists in mouse embryonic stem cells, human cancer cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We track this observation to a global gain of chromatin that artificially reduces ChIP signals from facultative heterochromatin during normalisation. Our results point to substantial limitations in using RNase A treatment for mapping RNA-dependent chromatin occupancy and invalidate conclusions that were previously established for PRC2 based on this assay.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microtubule motors, like cytoplasmic dynein-1, are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activity in cells. Dynein functions as a [~]4 MDa complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognise diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as LIS1 remain unclear. To address this, we determine the cryo-EM structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. We show how JIP3 specifies complex formation despite a shorter coiled coil and lack of identifiable motifs compared to typical adaptors. We find LIS1 directly binds dynactins p150 subunit, closely tethering it to dynein. This interaction is necessary for dyneins cellular and in vitro activity. We also show how dyneins intermediate chain relieves p150s autoinhibition to enable LIS1 binding. Together, our data suggest LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) modifies chromatin to maintain repression of genes specific for other cell lineages and is essential for development. In vitro, RNA inhibits PRC2 catalytic activity and interaction with nucleosomes but the effect of RNA on PRC2 in cells has been unclear, with studies concluding that RNA either antagonises or promotes the association of PRC2 with chromatin. The addition of RNase A to chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions has been reported to reduce detection of PRC2 target sites, suggesting the existence of an RNA bridge that connects PRC2 to chromatin. Here, we show that this apparent loss of PRC2 chromatin association after RNase A treatment is due to non-specific chromatin precipitation. RNA degradation causes chromatin to precipitate out of solution, thereby reducing the enrichment of specific DNA sequences in chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions. Maintaining chromatin solubility by the addition of poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) rescues detection of PRC2 chromatin association upon RNA degradation. These findings undermine support for the model that RNA bridges PRC2 and chromatin in cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA quantitation tools are often either high-throughput or cost-effective, but rarely are they both. Existing methods can profile the transcriptome at great expense or are limited to quantifying a handful of genes by labor constraints. A technique that permits more throughput at a reduced cost could enable multi-gene kinetic studies, gene regulatory network analysis, and combinatorial genetic screens. Here, we introduce quantitative Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (qCARMEN): an RNA quantitation technique which leverages the programmable RNA-targeting capabilities of CRISPR-Cas13 to address this challenge by quantifying over 4,500 gene-sample pairs in a single experiment. Using qCARMEN, we studied the response profiles of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during interferon (IFN) stimulation and flavivirus infection. Additionally, we observed isoform switching kinetics during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. qCARMEN is a simple and inexpensive technique that greatly enhances the scalability of RNA quantitation for novel applications with performance similar to gold-standard methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piperacillin-Tazobactam is a {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combination which is amongst the most prescribed antimicrobials in hospital medicine. Piperacillin is inactivated by commonly carried resistance enzymes, but tazobactam inhibits these allowing successful treatment. The effect of piperacillin on Gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to the effects of tazobactam. We used a massive transposon mutagenesis approach (TraDIS-Xpress) to determine the genes in Escherichia coli that affect survival when exposed to piperacillin and tazobactam, separately and together. We found significant differences in the selective pressure of the two drugs: a striking finding was that multiple efflux pump families and regulators were essential for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but only one efflux system was beneficial for piperacillin. Additionally, we identified the shikimate kinase AroK as a potential target for tazobactam. This method also found that genes involved in DNA replication and repair reduced E. coli susceptibility to a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, not seen from either drug treatment alone. Treatment of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with piperacillin and/or tazobactam selected for mutants with reduced susceptibility, and SNP analyses supported the TraDIS-Xpress findings that tazobactam selects for changes in membrane permeability and maintenance associated with multidrug-resistance. Increased efflux activity is an important foundation of multidrug resistance in human pathogens, therefore the finding that tazobactam can select for this is concerning. These findings could have consequences for antibiotic prescription and should inform the development of future {beta}-lactamase inhibitors to reduce the global increase in multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein dosage is regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis and health. The dosage of proteins containing disordered low complexity domains (LCDs) must be particularly well-controlled to prevent aberrant disease, yet no mechanism to maintain homeostasis has been identified. Here we report a mutual homeostatic mechanism that controls the concentration of such proteins, termed &#39;interstasis&#39;, in which proteins with similar LCDs co-regulate their combined dosage through collective negative feedback. We focused on the mechanism that exploits the fundamental multivalency of GA-rich RNA regions that encode charged LCDs, including those with arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs). Modest variations in the abundance of an R-MCD protein change the properties of nuclear speckles, a protein-RNA condensate, selectively trapping multivalent GA-rich mRNAs to promote their nuclear retention. This interstasis depends on conserved codon biases, shared by Amniotes, which enhance the multivalency of GA-rich regions encoding charged LCDs. The threshold of interstasis is modulated by CLK kinases, which affect the nuclear speckle localisation of proteins such as TRA2B, key binder of GA-rich RNAs. Notably, many classes of LCDs are encoded by RNA regions containing multivalency-enhancing codon biases, each preferentially bound by specific proteins, suggesting that interstasis might co-regulate many classes of functionally related LCD-containing proteins through dose-sensitivity of various types of protein-RNA condensates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We previously showed that the germ cell specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility. It has remained unknown whether RBMXL2 evolved its role in splicing repression to deal with the transcriptionally permissive environment of meiosis or might fulfil a function required in all cells. RBMXL2 evolved from the X-linked RBMX gene, which is silenced during meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. Here we find that like RBMXL2, RBMX primarily operates as a splicing repressor in somatic cells, and specifically regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and RBMX represses the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. These similarities in overall function suggested that RBMXL2 during meiosis might replace the otherwise ubiquitous RBMX protein. To test this prediction we carried out inducible expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing in response to RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMXL2 replaces RBMX during meiosis, and these proteins have maintained parallel roles that must have been conserved over at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are important for the splicing inclusion of ultra-long exons because these are particularly susceptible to disruption by cryptic splice site selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is impeded by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically dead CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identified not only known SREs, but also a novel distal intronic splicing enhancer, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zebrafish has a remarkable and lifelong ability for cardiac regeneration after severe damage, whereas mammals lose their innate capacity for heart regeneration during early postnatal development. This study aimed to investigate whether the decreased production of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle and the reduction in cardiac regenerative ability.

We identified growth factors with declining expression levels during early postnatal life in the mouse model and assessed the pro-proliferative ability of these factors on neonatal murine primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our findings confirmed the previously reported pro-proliferative effects of NRG1, IL1b, RANKL, IGF2 and IL6, while also identifying novel potential pro-regenerative growth factors. Among them, BMP7 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy.

Bmp7 knockdown interfered with the proliferation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture and adult bmp7 mutant zebrafish displayed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression was sufficient to boost cardiomyocyte cycling in regenerating zebrafish hearts, while BMP7 administration stimulated mouse cardiomyocyte cycling at postnatal-day-7, when cardiomyocytes ceased to proliferate, and enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo in adult mice following myocardial infarction.

Mechanistically, BMP7-induced proliferation was mediated by type I BMP receptors BMPR1A and ACVR1, and type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. Downstream signalling involved SMAD5, ERK and AKT.

In conclusion, the administration of BMP7 holds promise as a strategy to stimulate heart regeneration following cardiac injury.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rhodnius prolixus is currently the model vector of choice for studying Chagas disease transmission, a debilitating disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Despite the broad use of double-stranded RNA interference for the knockdown of gene function in R. prolixus, transgenesis and gene editing protocols are still lacking. Here we tested Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT Control) and direct parental injection of CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) for the maternal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 elements to developing R. prolixus oocytes, and strategies for the identification of insertions/deletions (indels) in target loci of resulting gene-edited G0 nymphs. We demonstrate successful ReMOT Control-mediated gene editing of the eye color markers Rp-scarlet and Rp-white, and the cuticle color marker Rp-yellow, with highest effectiveness obtained using the ovary-targeting BtKV ligand. These results provide proof-of-concepts for generating somatic mutations in R. prolixus and potentially for generating germline edited lines in triatomines. Our studies also suggest that optimal strategies for recovery of mutations include performing multiple gRNA injections and the use of visible phenotypes such as those displayed in the Rp-scarlet, Rp-white and Rp-yellow loci for future Co-CRISPR experiments. These results will lay the foundation for gene editing protocols for triatomines and could lead to the development of novel control strategies for vectors of Chagas disease.

Author SummaryRhodnius prolixus is an insect vector of the protozoan Trypanossoma cruzi, causative agent of debilitating Chagas disease. To fight the spread of the disease, it has been suggested that biological control of the insect should be attempted. Gene editing by the novel CRISPR methodology holds great promise in this sense, as it enables to target almost any gene in the genome for mutagenesis, thus allowing the control of insect physiology and reproduction. Here we have tested protocols for the delivery of CRISPR reagents as an attempt to enable genome editing of the vector. Our results show that maternal delivery of CRISPR by the ReMOT Control method is efficient for mutating eye and cuticle color genes in the resulting nymphs, generating edited animals with red eyes, white eyes or a yellow cuticle. This is the first report of gene editing in a vector of Chagas disease and should lay the basis to produce modified animals either unable to carry the T. cruzi parasite or to reproduce.</p>
