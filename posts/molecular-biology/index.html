G.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547832\nHigh resolution antibody-antigen structures provide critical insights into immune recognition and can inform therapeutic design. The challenges of experimental structural determination and the diversity of the immune repertoire underscore the necessity of accurate computational tools for modeling antibody-antigen complexes. Initial benchmarking showed that despite overall success in modeling protein-protein complexes, AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer have limited success in modeling antibody-antigen interactions. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis of AlphaFolds antibody-antigen modeling performance on 429 nonredundant antibody-antigen complex structures, identifying useful confidence metrics for predicting model quality, and features of complexes associated with improved modeling success. We show the importance of bound-like component modeling in complex assembly accuracy, and that the current version of AlphaFold improves near-native modeling success to over 30%, versus approximately 20% for a previous version. With this improved success, AlphaFold can generate accurate antibody-antigen models in many cases, while additional training may further improve its performance.\nThe CPSF phosphatase module links transcription termination to chromatin silencing\nAuthors: Mateo Bonmati, E.; Fang, X.; Maple, R.; Fiedler, M.; Passmore, L. A.; Dean, C. A.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547976\nRNA-mediated chromatin silencing plays important roles in development and environmental response in many organisms. However, it is still unclear how the RNA, and/or the transcriptional processes producing them, trigger chromatin silencing. Through the study of developmental timing in plants we have found co-transcriptional RNA processing modulates a chromatin regulatory mechanism controlling quantitative expression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Here, we show that the phosphatase module of the mRNA 3 processing CPSF complex is central to this mechanism. The phosphatase module components APRF1 (yeast Swd2/human WDR82), TOPP4 (Glc7/PP1) and LD (which we show is functionally equivalent to Ref2/PNUTS) all function genetically downstream of the CPSF-mediated cleavage and polyadenylation and are necessary for chromatin modification that results in FLC transcriptional silencing. LD has been previously shown to stoichiometrically co-associate in vivo with the histone demethylase FLD. We show both proteins result in removal of H3K4 monomethylation in the central section of the FLC locus. This links transcription termination to delivery of chromatin modifications that then influence subsequent transcription. Thus, physical association of the CPSF phosphatase module with chromatin modifiers generates a transcription-coupled silencing mechanism. The conservation of the factors involved suggest this mechanism may be generally relevant to transcription-mediated chromatin silencing.\nMolecular recognition of an aversive odorant by the murine trace amine-associated receptor TAAR7f\nAuthors: Gusach, A.; Lee, Y.; Khoshgrudi, A. N.; Mukhaleva, E.; Ma, N.; Koers, E. J.; Chen, Q.; Edwards, P.; Huang, F.; Kim, J.; Mancia, F.; Veprintsev, D. J.; Vaidehi, N.; Weyand, S.; Tate, C. G.\nScore: 17.3, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547762\nThere are two main families of G protein-coupled receptors that detect odours in humans, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Their amino acid sequences are distinct, with the TAARs being most similar to the aminergic receptors such as those activated by adrenaline, serotonin and histamine. To elucidate the structural determinants of ligand recognition by TAARs, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of a murine receptor, mTAAR7f, coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and bound to the odorant N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCH) to an overall resolution of 2.9 [A]. DMCH is bound in a hydrophobic orthosteric binding site primarily through van der Waals interactions and a strong charge-charge interaction between the tertiary amine of the ligand and an aspartic acid residue. This site is distinct and non-overlapping with the binding site for the odorant propionate in the odorant receptor OR51E2. The structure, in combination with mutagenesis data and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the activation of the receptor follows a similar pathway to that of the {beta}-adrenoceptors, with the significant difference that DMCH interacts directly with one of the main activation microswitch residues.\nProgrammable RNA-guided endonucleases are widespread in eukaryotes and their viruses\nAuthors: Jiang, K.; Lim, J.; Sgrizzi, S.; Trinh, M.; Kayabolen, A.; Yutin, N.; Koonin, E. V.; Abudayyeh, O. O.; Gootenberg, J. S.\nScore: 261.2, Published: 2023-06-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544871\nTnpB proteins are RNA-guided nucleases that are broadly associated with IS200/605 family transposons in prokaryotes. TnpB homologs, named Fanzors, have been detected in genomes of some eukaryotes and large viruses, but their activity and functions in eukaryotes remain unknown. We searched genomes of diverse eukaryotes and their viruses for TnpB homologs and identified numerous putative RNA-guided nucleases that are often associated with various transposases, suggesting they are encoded in mobile genetic elements. Reconstruction of the evolution of these nucleases, which we rename Horizontally-transferred Eukaryotic RNA-guided Mobile Element Systems (HERMES), revealed multiple acquisitions of TnpBs by eukaryotes and subsequent diversification. In their adaptation and spread in eukaryotes, HERMES proteins acquired nuclear localization signals, and genes captured introns, indicating extensive, long term adaptation to functioning in eukaryotic cells. Biochemical and cellular evidence show that HERMES employ non-coding RNAs encoded adjacent to the nuclease for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA. HERMES nucleases contain a re-arranged catalytic site of the RuvC domain, similar to a distinct subset of TnpBs, and lack collateral cleavage activity. We demonstrate that HERMES can be harnessed for genome editing in human cells, highlighting the potential of these widespread eukaryotic RNA-guided nucleases for biotechnology applications.\nAntisense transcription and PRC2 repression function in parallel during vernalization\nAuthors: Nielsen, M.; Menon, G.; Zhao, Y.; Mateo-Bonmati, E.; Wolff, P.; Zhou, S.; Howard, M.; Dean, C.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547987\nNon-coding transcription induces chromatin changes that can mediate environmental responsiveness, but the causes and consequences of these mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigate how antisense transcription interfaces with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 silencing during winter-induced epigenetic regulation of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We combine genetic and chromatin analyses on lines ineffective or hyperactive for the antisense pathway, with computational modelling to reconcile all the data on FLC repression. Our results show that FLC is silenced through pathways that function with different dynamics: an antisense transcription-mediated pathway capable of fast response; and in parallel a slow Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) switching mechanism that maintains each allele in an epigenetically silenced state. Components of both the antisense and PRC2 pathways are regulated by a common transcriptional regulator (NTL8), which accumulates by reduced dilution due to slow growth at low temperature. The parallel activities of the regulatory steps, and their control by temperature-dependent growth dynamics, creates a flexible system for registering widely fluctuating natural temperature conditions that change year on year, and yet ensure robust epigenetic silencing of FLC.\nEfficient Formation of Single-copy Human Artificial Chromosomes\nAuthors: Gambogi, C. W.; Mer, E.; Brown, D. M.; Yankson, G.; Gavade, J. N.; Logsdon, G. A.; Heun, P.; Glass, J. I.; Black, B. E.\nScore: 40.4, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547284\nLarge DNA assembly methodologies underlie milestone achievements in synthetic prokaryotic and budding yeast chromosomes. While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through [~]125 bp DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. Here, we describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a [~]750 kb construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells. One-Sentence SummaryA quarter century after the first human artificial chromosomes, a solution to their uncontrolled multimerization is achieved.\nTrabectedin derails transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair to induce DNA breaks in highly transcribed genes\nAuthors: Son, K.; Takhaveev, V.; Mor, V.; Yu, H.; Dillier, E.; Zilio, N.; Pullen, N. J. L.; Ivanov, D.; Ulrich, H. D.; Sturla, S. J.; Scharer, O. D.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548294\nMost genotoxic anticancer agents fail in tumors with intact DNA repair. Therefore, trabectedin, a unique agent more toxic to cells with active DNA repair, specifically transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), provides new therapeutic opportunities. To unlock the potential of trabectedin and inform its application in precision oncology, a full mechanistic understanding of the drug's TC-NER-dependent toxicity is needed. Here, we determined that abortive TC-NER of trabectedin-DNA adducts forms persistent single-strand breaks (SSBs) as the adducts block the second of the two sequential NER incisions. We mapped the 3'-hydroxyl groups of SSBs originating from the first NER incision at trabectedin lesions, recording TC-NER on a genome-wide scale. We showed that trabectedin-induced SSBs primarily occur in transcribed strands of active genes and peak near transcription start sites. Frequent SSBs were also found outside gene bodies, connecting TC-NER to divergent transcription from promoters. This work advances the use trabectedin for precision oncology and for studying TC-NER and transcription.\nMolecular and structural basis of the heterochromatin-specific chromatin remodeling activity by Arabidopsis DDM1\nAuthors: Osakabe, A.; Takizawa, Y.; Horikoshi, N.; Hatazawa, S.; Negishi, L.; Berger, F.; Kakutani, T.; Kurumizaka, H.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548306\nThe chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) deposits the histone H2A variant H2A.W and silences transposons in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the molecular mechanisms by which DDM1 specifically targets the nucleosome containing H2A.W and allows chromatin writers to access heterochromatin remained elusive. Here, we show that DDM1 promotes remodeling of the H2A.W nucleosome and requires interactions with the H2A.W-specific C-terminal tail. The cryo-EM structure of the DDM1-H2A.W nucleosome complex revealed that DDM1 binds to the N-terminal tail of H4 and the nucleosomal DNA. Comparison with the cryo-EM structure of the nucleosome containing H2A.W suggested that DDM1 increases the DNA end flexibility of nucleosomes. Based on these biochemical and structural results, we propose that the chromatin remodeling activity of DDM1 with the heterochromatin-specific H2A.W contributes to the maintenance of repressive epigenetic marks in heterochromatin by providing DNA methyltransferases with access to nucleosomal DNA.\nProteomics analysis reveals a role for E. coli polyphosphate kinase in membrane structure and polymyxin resistance during starvation\nAuthors: Baijal, K.; Abrumchuk, I.; Herrera, C.; Trent, M. S.; Lavallee-Adam, M.; Downey, M.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.546892\nPolyphosphates (polyP) are chains of inorganic phosphates that can reach over 1000 residues in length. In Escherichia coli, polyP is produced by the polyP kinase (PPK) and is thought to play a protective role during the response to cellular stress. However, the molecular pathways impacted by PPK activity and polyP accumulation remain poorly characterized. In this work we used label-free mass spectrometry to study the response of bacteria that cannot produce polyP ({Delta}ppk) during starvation to identify novel pathways regulated by PPK. In response to starvation, we found 92 proteins significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and {Delta}ppk mutant cells. Wild-type cells were enriched for proteins related to amino acid biosynthesis and transport, while{Delta} ppk mutants were enriched for proteins related to translation and ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that without PPK, cells remain inappropriately primed for growth even in the absence of required building blocks. From our dataset, we were particularly interested in Arn and EptA proteins, which were downregulated in {Delta}ppk mutants compared to wild-type controls, because they play a role in lipid A modifications linked to polymyxin resistance. Using western blotting, we confirm differential expression of these and related proteins, and provide evidence that this mis-regulation in {Delta}ppk cells stems from a failure to induce the BasS/BasR two-component system during starvation. We also show that {Delta}ppk mutants unable to upregulate Arn and EptA expression lack the respective L-Ara4N and pEtN modifications on lipid A. In line with this observation, loss of ppk restores polymyxin sensitivity in resistant strains carrying a constitutively active basR allele. Overall, we show a new role for PPK in lipid A modification during starvation and provide a rationale for targeting PPK to sensitize bacteria towards polymyxin treatment. We further anticipate that our proteomics work will provide an important resource for researchers interested in the diverse pathways impacted by PPK.\nProximal termination generates a transcriptional state that determines the rate of establishment of Polycomb silencing\nAuthors: Menon, G.; Mateo Bonmati, E.; Reeck, S.; Maple, R.; Wu, Z.; Ietswaart, R.; Dean, C.; Howard, M.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547969\nChromatin-mediated transcriptional states are central to gene regulation in development and environmental response, with co-transcriptional processes involved in their establishment. Quantitative regulation of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is key to determining reproductive strategy. Low FLC expression underpins rapid-cycling and is established through a transcription-coupled chromatin mechanism. Proximal termination of antisense transcripts is linked to histone 3 lysine 4 demethylation of adjacent chromatin that leads to stable Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. However, how the termination-induced chromatin environment influences the switch to PRC2 silencing is still unclear. Here, we combine molecular approaches with theory to develop a dynamic mathematical model that incorporates sense/antisense transcription, alternative termination sites, and the interplay of these processes with varying levels of activating (H3K4me1)/silencing (H3K27me3) histone modifications. The model captures different feedback mechanisms between co-transcriptional 3 processing and chromatin modifications, detailing how proximal co-transcriptional polyadenylation/termination can set the subsequent level of productive transcription via removal of H3K4 monomethylation across the locus. Since transcription universally antagonizes Polycomb silencing, this dictates the degree of antagonism to H3K27me3, thus determining the rate at which Polycomb repression is established. These principles are likely to be central to regulating transcriptional output at many targets and generally relevant for Polycomb silencing in many genomes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">High resolution antibody-antigen structures provide critical insights into immune recognition and can inform therapeutic design. The challenges of experimental structural determination and the diversity of the immune repertoire underscore the necessity of accurate computational tools for modeling antibody-antigen complexes. Initial benchmarking showed that despite overall success in modeling protein-protein complexes, AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer have limited success in modeling antibody-antigen interactions. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis of AlphaFolds antibody-antigen modeling performance on 429 nonredundant antibody-antigen complex structures, identifying useful confidence metrics for predicting model quality, and features of complexes associated with improved modeling success. We show the importance of bound-like component modeling in complex assembly accuracy, and that the current version of AlphaFold improves near-native modeling success to over 30%, versus approximately 20% for a previous version. With this improved success, AlphaFold can generate accurate antibody-antigen models in many cases, while additional training may further improve its performance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA-mediated chromatin silencing plays important roles in development and environmental response in many organisms. However, it is still unclear how the RNA, and/or the transcriptional processes producing them, trigger chromatin silencing. Through the study of developmental timing in plants we have found co-transcriptional RNA processing modulates a chromatin regulatory mechanism controlling quantitative expression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Here, we show that the phosphatase module of the mRNA 3 processing CPSF complex is central to this mechanism. The phosphatase module components APRF1 (yeast Swd2/human WDR82), TOPP4 (Glc7/PP1) and LD (which we show is functionally equivalent to Ref2/PNUTS) all function genetically downstream of the CPSF-mediated cleavage and polyadenylation and are necessary for chromatin modification that results in FLC transcriptional silencing. LD has been previously shown to stoichiometrically co-associate in vivo with the histone demethylase FLD. We show both proteins result in removal of H3K4 monomethylation in the central section of the FLC locus. This links transcription termination to delivery of chromatin modifications that then influence subsequent transcription. Thus, physical association of the CPSF phosphatase module with chromatin modifiers generates a transcription-coupled silencing mechanism. The conservation of the factors involved suggest this mechanism may be generally relevant to transcription-mediated chromatin silencing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There are two main families of G protein-coupled receptors that detect odours in humans, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Their amino acid sequences are distinct, with the TAARs being most similar to the aminergic receptors such as those activated by adrenaline, serotonin and histamine. To elucidate the structural determinants of ligand recognition by TAARs, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of a murine receptor, mTAAR7f, coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and bound to the odorant N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCH) to an overall resolution of 2.9 [A]. DMCH is bound in a hydrophobic orthosteric binding site primarily through van der Waals interactions and a strong charge-charge interaction between the tertiary amine of the ligand and an aspartic acid residue. This site is distinct and non-overlapping with the binding site for the odorant propionate in the odorant receptor OR51E2. The structure, in combination with mutagenesis data and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that the activation of the receptor follows a similar pathway to that of the {beta}-adrenoceptors, with the significant difference that DMCH interacts directly with one of the main activation microswitch residues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">TnpB proteins are RNA-guided nucleases that are broadly associated with IS200/605 family transposons in prokaryotes. TnpB homologs, named Fanzors, have been detected in genomes of some eukaryotes and large viruses, but their activity and functions in eukaryotes remain unknown. We searched genomes of diverse eukaryotes and their viruses for TnpB homologs and identified numerous putative RNA-guided nucleases that are often associated with various transposases, suggesting they are encoded in mobile genetic elements. Reconstruction of the evolution of these nucleases, which we rename Horizontally-transferred Eukaryotic RNA-guided Mobile Element Systems (HERMES), revealed multiple acquisitions of TnpBs by eukaryotes and subsequent diversification. In their adaptation and spread in eukaryotes, HERMES proteins acquired nuclear localization signals, and genes captured introns, indicating extensive, long term adaptation to functioning in eukaryotic cells. Biochemical and cellular evidence show that HERMES employ non-coding RNAs encoded adjacent to the nuclease for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA. HERMES nucleases contain a re-arranged catalytic site of the RuvC domain, similar to a distinct subset of TnpBs, and lack collateral cleavage activity. We demonstrate that HERMES can be harnessed for genome editing in human cells, highlighting the potential of these widespread eukaryotic RNA-guided nucleases for biotechnology applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-coding transcription induces chromatin changes that can mediate environmental responsiveness, but the causes and consequences of these mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigate how antisense transcription interfaces with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 silencing during winter-induced epigenetic regulation of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We combine genetic and chromatin analyses on lines ineffective or hyperactive for the antisense pathway, with computational modelling to reconcile all the data on FLC repression. Our results show that FLC is silenced through pathways that function with different dynamics: an antisense transcription-mediated pathway capable of fast response; and in parallel a slow Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) switching mechanism that maintains each allele in an epigenetically silenced state. Components of both the antisense and PRC2 pathways are regulated by a common transcriptional regulator (NTL8), which accumulates by reduced dilution due to slow growth at low temperature. The parallel activities of the regulatory steps, and their control by temperature-dependent growth dynamics, creates a flexible system for registering widely fluctuating natural temperature conditions that change year on year, and yet ensure robust epigenetic silencing of FLC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large DNA assembly methodologies underlie milestone achievements in synthetic prokaryotic and budding yeast chromosomes. While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through [~]125 bp DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. Here, we describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a [~]750 kb construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.

One-Sentence SummaryA quarter century after the first human artificial chromosomes, a solution to their uncontrolled multimerization is achieved.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most genotoxic anticancer agents fail in tumors with intact DNA repair. Therefore, trabectedin, a unique agent more toxic to cells with active DNA repair, specifically transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), provides new therapeutic opportunities. To unlock the potential of trabectedin and inform its application in precision oncology, a full mechanistic understanding of the drug&#39;s TC-NER-dependent toxicity is needed. Here, we determined that abortive TC-NER of trabectedin-DNA adducts forms persistent single-strand breaks (SSBs) as the adducts block the second of the two sequential NER incisions. We mapped the 3&#39;-hydroxyl groups of SSBs originating from the first NER incision at trabectedin lesions, recording TC-NER on a genome-wide scale. We showed that trabectedin-induced SSBs primarily occur in transcribed strands of active genes and peak near transcription start sites. Frequent SSBs were also found outside gene bodies, connecting TC-NER to divergent transcription from promoters. This work advances the use trabectedin for precision oncology and for studying TC-NER and transcription.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) deposits the histone H2A variant H2A.W and silences transposons in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the molecular mechanisms by which DDM1 specifically targets the nucleosome containing H2A.W and allows chromatin writers to access heterochromatin remained elusive. Here, we show that DDM1 promotes remodeling of the H2A.W nucleosome and requires interactions with the H2A.W-specific C-terminal tail. The cryo-EM structure of the DDM1-H2A.W nucleosome complex revealed that DDM1 binds to the N-terminal tail of H4 and the nucleosomal DNA. Comparison with the cryo-EM structure of the nucleosome containing H2A.W suggested that DDM1 increases the DNA end flexibility of nucleosomes. Based on these biochemical and structural results, we propose that the chromatin remodeling activity of DDM1 with the heterochromatin-specific H2A.W contributes to the maintenance of repressive epigenetic marks in heterochromatin by providing DNA methyltransferases with access to nucleosomal DNA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polyphosphates (polyP) are chains of inorganic phosphates that can reach over 1000 residues in length. In Escherichia coli, polyP is produced by the polyP kinase (PPK) and is thought to play a protective role during the response to cellular stress. However, the molecular pathways impacted by PPK activity and polyP accumulation remain poorly characterized. In this work we used label-free mass spectrometry to study the response of bacteria that cannot produce polyP ({Delta}ppk) during starvation to identify novel pathways regulated by PPK.

In response to starvation, we found 92 proteins significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and {Delta}ppk mutant cells. Wild-type cells were enriched for proteins related to amino acid biosynthesis and transport, while{Delta} ppk mutants were enriched for proteins related to translation and ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that without PPK, cells remain inappropriately primed for growth even in the absence of required building blocks.

From our dataset, we were particularly interested in Arn and EptA proteins, which were downregulated in {Delta}ppk mutants compared to wild-type controls, because they play a role in lipid A modifications linked to polymyxin resistance. Using western blotting, we confirm differential expression of these and related proteins, and provide evidence that this mis-regulation in {Delta}ppk cells stems from a failure to induce the BasS/BasR two-component system during starvation. We also show that {Delta}ppk mutants unable to upregulate Arn and EptA expression lack the respective L-Ara4N and pEtN modifications on lipid A. In line with this observation, loss of ppk restores polymyxin sensitivity in resistant strains carrying a constitutively active basR allele.

Overall, we show a new role for PPK in lipid A modification during starvation and provide a rationale for targeting PPK to sensitize bacteria towards polymyxin treatment. We further anticipate that our proteomics work will provide an important resource for researchers interested in the diverse pathways impacted by PPK.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chromatin-mediated transcriptional states are central to gene regulation in development and environmental response, with co-transcriptional processes involved in their establishment. Quantitative regulation of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is key to determining reproductive strategy. Low FLC expression underpins rapid-cycling and is established through a transcription-coupled chromatin mechanism. Proximal termination of antisense transcripts is linked to histone 3 lysine 4 demethylation of adjacent chromatin that leads to stable Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. However, how the termination-induced chromatin environment influences the switch to PRC2 silencing is still unclear. Here, we combine molecular approaches with theory to develop a dynamic mathematical model that incorporates sense/antisense transcription, alternative termination sites, and the interplay of these processes with varying levels of activating (H3K4me1)/silencing (H3K27me3) histone modifications. The model captures different feedback mechanisms between co-transcriptional 3 processing and chromatin modifications, detailing how proximal co-transcriptional polyadenylation/termination can set the subsequent level of productive transcription via removal of H3K4 monomethylation across the locus. Since transcription universally antagonizes Polycomb silencing, this dictates the degree of antagonism to H3K27me3, thus determining the rate at which Polycomb repression is established. These principles are likely to be central to regulating transcriptional output at many targets and generally relevant for Polycomb silencing in many genomes.</p>
