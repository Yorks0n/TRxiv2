M.; Sierra, M. A.; Mason, C. E.; Goodman, L. B.; Whittaker, G.\nScore: 40.3, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551356\nFeline coronavirus type 1 (FCoV-1) is widely known for causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic infection that is often fatal, with the virus known as the FIPV biotype. However, subclinical disease also occurs, in which cats may not show signs and intermittently shed the virus, including in feces, possibly for long periods of time. This virus is known as the FECV biotype. Progression of FECV to FIPV has been linked to several genomic changes, however a specific region of the viral spike protein at the interface of the spike S1 and S2 domains has been especially implicated. In this study, we followed a cat (#576) for six years from 2017, at which time FCoV-1 was detected in feces and conjunctival swabs, until 2022, when the animal was euthanized based on a diagnosis of alimentary small cell lymphoma. Over this time period, the cat was clinically diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic rhinitis, and cardiac problems were also suspected. Using hybridization capture targeting the spike (S) gene of FCoV followed by next-generation sequencing, we screened 27 clinical samples. We detected FCoV-1 in 4 samples taken in 2017 (intestine and nasal tissue, feces, and conjunctiva), and 3 samples taken in 2022 (feces, and intestinal and heart tissue), but not in fecal samples taken in 2019 and 2020. Next, we focused on the S1/S2 region within S, which contains the furin cleavage site (FCS), a key regulator of viral transmission and pathogenesis. We show that the FCoV-1 variants obtained from feces in 2017 and 2022 were identical, while the ones from conjunctiva (2017), heart (2022), and intestine (2017 and 2022) were distinct. Sequence comparison of all the variants obtained showed that most of the non-synonymous changes in the S1/S2 region occur within the FCS. In the heart, we found two variants that differed by a single nucleotide, resulting in distinct FCS motifs that differ in one amino acid. It is predicted that one of these FCS motifs will down-regulate spike cleavability. The variant from the conjunctiva (2017) had a 6-nucleotide in-frame insertion that resulted in a longer and more exposed S1/S2 loop, which is predicted to be more accessible to the furin protease. Our studies indicate that FCoV-1 can independently persist in the gastrointestinal tract and heart of a cat over a long period of time without evidence of typical FIP signs, with intermittent viral shedding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.\nRetrotransposon addiction promotes centromere function via epigenetically activated small RNAs\nAuthors: Shimada, A.; Cahn, J.; Ernst, E.; Lynn, J.; Grimanelli, D.; Henderson, I. R.; Kakutani, T.; Martienssen, R. A.\nScore: 36.7, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551486\nRetrotransposons have invaded eukaryotic centromeres in cycles of repeat expansion and purging, but the function of centromeric retrotransposons, if any, has remained unclear. In Arabidopsis, centromeric ATHILA retrotransposons give rise to epigenetically activated short interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in mutants in DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1), which promote histone H3 lysine-9 di-methylation (H3K9me2). Here, we show that mutants which lose both DDM1 and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) have pleiotropic developmental defects and mis-segregation of chromosome 5 during mitosis. Fertility defects are epigenetically inherited with the centromeric region of chromosome 5, and can be rescued by directing artificial small RNAs to a single family of ATHILA5 retrotransposons specifically embedded within this centromeric region. easiRNAs and H3K9me2 promote pericentromeric condensation, chromosome cohesion and proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Insertion of ATHILA silences transcription, while simultaneously making centromere function dependent on retrotransposon small RNAs, promoting the selfish survival and spread of centromeric retrotransposons. Parallels are made with the fission yeast S. pombe, where chromosome segregation depends on RNAi, and with humans, where chromosome segregation depends on both RNAi and HELLS[DDM1].\nMolecular profiling of sponge deflation reveals an ancient relaxant-inflammatory response\nAuthors: Ruperti, F.; Becher, I.; Stokkermans, A.; Wang, L.; Marschlich, N.; Potel, C.; Maus, E.; Stein, F.; Drotleff, B.; Schippers, K. J.; Nickel, M.; Prevedel, R.; Musser, J. M.; Savitski, M. M.; Arendt, D.\nScore: 29.5, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551666\nA hallmark of animals is the coordination of whole-body movement. Neurons and muscles are central to this, yet coordinated movements also exist in sponges that lack these cell types. Sponges are sessile animals with a complex canal system for filter-feeding. They undergo whole-body movements resembling \"contractions\" that lead to canal closure and water expulsion. Here, we combine 3D optical coherence microscopy, pharmacology, and functional proteomics to elucidate anatomy, molecular physiology, and control of these movements. We find them driven by the relaxation of actomyosin stress fibers in epithelial canal cells, which leads to whole-body deflation via collapse of the incurrent and expansion of the excurrent system, controlled by an Akt/NO/PKG/A pathway. A concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species and secretion of proteinases and cytokines indicate an inflammation-like state reminiscent of vascular endothelial cells experiencing oscillatory shear stress. This suggests an ancient relaxant-inflammatory response of perturbed fluid-carrying systems in animals. HighlightsO_LISponge deflation is driven by tension release in actomyosin stress fibers of epithelial pinacocytes C_LIO_LIAkt kinase/Nitric oxide/Protein kinase G/A regulate actomyosin relaxation C_LIO_LIAgitation-induced deflation coincides with an inflammatory state C_LIO_LIThe sponge relaxant-inflammatory response is evolutionary related to similar responses in the vertebrate vascular system C_LI\nJointly modeling deep mutational scans identifies shifted mutational effects among SARS-CoV-2 spike homologs\nAuthors: Haddox, H. K.; Galloway, J. G.; Dadonaite, B.; Bloom, J. D.; Matsen, F. A.; DeWitt, W. S.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551037\nDeep mutational scanning (DMS) is a high-throughput experimental technique that measures the effects of thousands of mutations to a protein. These experiments can be performed on multiple homologs of a protein or on the same protein selected under multiple conditions. It is often of biological interest to identify mutations with shifted effects across homologs or conditions. However, it is challenging to determine if observed shifts arise from biological signal or experimental noise. Here, we describe a method for jointly inferring mutational effects across multiple DMS experiments while also identifying mutations that have shifted in their effects among experiments. A key aspect of our method is to regularize the inferred shifts, so that they are nonzero only when strongly supported by the data. We apply this method to DMS experiments that measure how mutations to spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2) affect cell entry. Most mutational effects are conserved between these spike homologs, but a fraction have markedly shifted. We experimentally validate a subset of the mutations inferred to have shifted effects, and confirm differences of \u003e1,000-fold in the impact of the same mutation on spike-mediated viral infection across spikes from different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, our work establishes a general approach for comparing sets of DMS experiments to identify biologically important shifts in mutational effects. Significance StatementAmino-acid mutations to a protein have effects that can shift as the protein evolves or is put under new selective pressure. The effects of amino-acid mutations to a specific protein under a defined selective pressure can be measured by deep mutational scanning experiments. Here, we devise an approach to quantify shifts in mutational effects between experiments performed on different homologs (i.e. variants) of the same protein, or on the same protein selected under different conditions. We use this approach to compare experiments performed on three homologs of SARS-CoV-2 spike, identifying mutations that have shifted in their effect on spike-mediated viral infection by \u003e1,000 fold across SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nCyanobacterial α-carboxysome carbonic anhydrase is allosterically regulated by the Rubisco substrate RuBP\nAuthors: Pulsford, S. B.; Outram, M. A.; Forster, B.; Rhodes, T.; Williams, S. J.; Badger, M. R.; Price, G. D.; Jackson, C. J.; Long, B. M.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551272\nCyanobacterial CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) sequester a globally significant proportion of carbon into the biosphere. Proteinaceous microcompartments, called carboxysomes, play a critical role in CCM function, housing two enzymes to enhance CO2 fixation: carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Rubisco. Despite its importance, our current understanding of the carboxysomal CAs found in [a]-cyanobacteria, CsoSCA, remains limited, particularly regarding the regulation of its activity. Here, we present the first structural and biochemical study of CsoSCA from the cyanobacterium Cyanobium PCC7001. Our results show that the Cyanobium CsoSCA is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and forms a hexameric trimer of dimers. Comprehensive phylogenetic and mutational analyses are consistent with this regulation appearing exclusively in cyanobacterial [a]-carboxysome CAs. These findings clarify the biologically relevant oligomeric state of -carboxysomal CAs and advance our understanding of the regulation of photosynthesis in this globally dominant lineage. One-Sentence SummaryThe carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase, CsoSCA, is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate RuBP, revealing a novel mechanism controlling key enzyme activity in cyanobacterial -carboxysomes.\nStructure of the complete S. cerevisiae Rpd3S-nucleosome complex\nAuthors: Markert, J. W.; Vos, S. M.; Farnung, L.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551877\nAcetylation of histones is a key post-translational modification that guides gene expression regulation. In yeast, the class I histone deacetylase containing Rpd3S complex plays a critical role in the suppression of spurious transcription by removing histone acetylation from actively transcribed genes. The S. cerevisiae Rpd3S complex has five subunits (Rpd3, Sin3, Rco1, Eaf3, and Ume1) but its subunit stoichiometry and how the complex engages nucleosomes to achieve substrate specificity remains elusive. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the complete Rpd3S complex bound to a nucleosome. Sin3 and two copies of subunits Rco1 and Eaf3 encircle the deacetylase subunit Rpd3 and coordinate the binding of Ume1. The Rpd3S complex binds both trimethylated H3 tails at position lysine 36 and makes multiple additional contacts with the nucleosomal DNA, the H2A-H2B acidic patch, and histone H3. Direct regulation via the Sin3 subunit coordinates binding of the acetylated histone substrate to achieve substrate specificity.\nLeucine suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic islets by directly modulating alpha-cell cAMP\nAuthors: Knuth, E. R.; Foster, H. R.; Jin, E.; Merrins, M. J.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551113\nObjectivePancreatic islets are nutrient sensors that regulate organismal blood glucose homeostasis. Glucagon release from the pancreatic -cell is important under fasted, fed, and hypoglycemic conditions, yet metabolic regulation of -cells remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a previously unexplored role for physiological levels of leucine, which is classically regarded as a {beta}-cell fuel, in the intrinsic regulation of -cell glucagon release. MethodsGcgCreERT:CAMPER and GcgCreERT:GCaMP6s mice were generated to perform dynamic, high-throughput functional measurements of -cell cAMP and Ca2+ within the intact islet. Islet perifusion assays were used for simultaneous, time-resolved measurements of glucagon and insulin release from mouse and human islets. The effects of leucine were compared with glucose and the mitochondrial fuels 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, non-metabolized leucine analog that activates glutamate dehydrogenase), -ketoisocaproate (KIC, leucine metabolite), and methyl-succinate (complex II fuel). CYN154806 (Sstr2 antagonist), diazoxide (KATP activator, which prevents Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from , {beta}, and {delta}-cells), and dispersed -cells were used to inhibit islet paracrine signaling and identify -cell intrinsic effects. ResultsMimicking the effect of glucose, leucine strongly suppressed amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, leucine dose-dependently reduced -cell cAMP at physiological concentrations, with an IC50 of 57, 440, and 1162 M at 2, 6, and 10 mM glucose, without affecting -cell Ca2+. Leucine also reduced -cell cAMP in islets treated with Sstr2 antagonist or diazoxide, as well as dispersed -cells, indicating an -cell intrinsic effect. The effect of leucine was matched by KIC and the glutamate dehydrogenase activator BCH, but not methyl-succinate, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glucose, which stimulates anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, had the same suppressive effect on -cell cAMP but with lower potency. Similarly to mouse islets, leucine suppressed glucagon secretion from human islets under hypoglycemic conditions. ConclusionsThese findings highlight an important role for physiological levels of leucine in the metabolic regulation of -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion. Leucine functions primarily through an -cell intrinsic effect that is dependent on glutamate dehydrogenase, in addition to the well-established -cell regulation by {beta}/{delta}-cell paracrine signaling. Our results suggest that mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis facilitates the glucagonostatic effect of both leucine and glucose, which cooperatively suppress -cell tone by reducing cAMP.

O.; Linossi, E. M.; Macdonald, C. B.; Espinoza, C. A.; Michaud, J. M.; Coyote-Maestas, W.; Collisson, E. A.; Jura, N.; Fraser, J. S.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551866\nMET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (MET{Delta}Ex14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild type and MET{Delta}Ex14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase C helix, pointing to differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a {beta}5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for kinase domain activation in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.\nGerm granule association drives small RNA specificity for a nuclear Argonaute protein\nAuthors: Chen, S.; Phillips, C. M.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551545\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene silencing process that exists in diverse organisms to protect genome integrity and regulate gene expression. In C. elegans, the majority of RNAi pathway proteins localize to perinuclear, phase-separated germ granules, which are comprised of sub-domains referred to as P granules, Mutator foci, Z granules, and SIMR foci. However, the protein components and function of the newly discovered SIMR foci are unknown. Here we demonstrate that HRDE-2 localizes to SIMR foci and interacts with the germline nuclear RNAi Argonaute HRDE-1. Furthermore, HRDE-1 also localizes to SIMR foci, dependent on HRDE-2, but only in its small RNA unbound state. This germ granule localization is critical to promote the small RNA binding specificity of HRDE-1 and, in the absence of HRDE-2, HRDE-1 exclusively loads CSR-class 22G-RNAs rather than WAGO-class 22G-RNAs, resulting in inappropriate H3K9me3 deposition on CSR-target genes. Thus, our study demonstrates that the recruitment of unloaded HRDE-1 to germ granules, mediated by HRDE-2, is critical to ensure that the correct small RNAs are used to guide nuclear RNA silencing in the C. elegans germline.\nProteome and phospholipidome interrelationship of synovial fluid-derived extracellular vesicles in equine osteoarthritis: An exploratory multi-omics study to identify composite biomarkers\nAuthors: Clarke, E. J.; Varela, L.; Jenkins, R. E.; Lozano-Andres, E.; Cywinska, A.; Przewozny, M.; van Weeren, R.; Lest, C. H. A. V. d.; Peffers, M. J.; Wauben, M.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551609\nOsteoarthritis causes progressive joint deterioration, severe morbidity, and reduced mobility in both humans and horses. Currently, osteoarthritis is diagnosed at late stages through clinical examination and radiographic imaging, hence it is challenging to address and provide timely therapeutic interventions to slow disease progression or ameliorate symptoms. Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived vesicles that play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and are potential sources for specific composite biomarker panel discovery. We here used a multi-omics strategy combining proteomics and phospholipidomics in an integral approach to identify composite biomarkers associated to purified extracellular vesicles from synovial fluid of healthy, mildly and severely osteoarthritic equine joints. Although the number of extracellular vesicles was unaffected by osteoarthritis, proteome profiling of extracellular vesicles by mass spectrometry identified 40 differentially expressed proteins (non-adjusted p\u003c0.05) in osteoarthritic joints associated with 7 significant canonical pathways in osteoarthritis. Moreover, pathway analysis unveiled changes in disease and molecular functions during osteoarthritis development. Phospholipidome profiling by mass spectrometry showed a relative increase in sphingomyelin and a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine in extracellular vesicles derived from osteoarthritic joints compared to healthy joints. Unsupervised data integration revealed positive correlations between the proteome and the phospholipidome. Comprehensive analysis showed that some phospholipids and their related proteins increased as the severity of osteoarthritis progressed, while others decreased or remained stable. Altogether our data show interrelationships between synovial fluid extracellular vesicle-associated phospholipids and proteins responding to osteoarthritis pathology and which could be explored as potential composite diagnostic biomarkers of disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Feline coronavirus type 1 (FCoV-1) is widely known for causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic infection that is often fatal, with the virus known as the FIPV biotype. However, subclinical disease also occurs, in which cats may not show signs and intermittently shed the virus, including in feces, possibly for long periods of time. This virus is known as the FECV biotype. Progression of FECV to FIPV has been linked to several genomic changes, however a specific region of the viral spike protein at the interface of the spike S1 and S2 domains has been especially implicated. In this study, we followed a cat (#576) for six years from 2017, at which time FCoV-1 was detected in feces and conjunctival swabs, until 2022, when the animal was euthanized based on a diagnosis of alimentary small cell lymphoma. Over this time period, the cat was clinically diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic rhinitis, and cardiac problems were also suspected. Using hybridization capture targeting the spike (S) gene of FCoV followed by next-generation sequencing, we screened 27 clinical samples. We detected FCoV-1 in 4 samples taken in 2017 (intestine and nasal tissue, feces, and conjunctiva), and 3 samples taken in 2022 (feces, and intestinal and heart tissue), but not in fecal samples taken in 2019 and 2020. Next, we focused on the S1/S2 region within S, which contains the furin cleavage site (FCS), a key regulator of viral transmission and pathogenesis. We show that the FCoV-1 variants obtained from feces in 2017 and 2022 were identical, while the ones from conjunctiva (2017), heart (2022), and intestine (2017 and 2022) were distinct. Sequence comparison of all the variants obtained showed that most of the non-synonymous changes in the S1/S2 region occur within the FCS. In the heart, we found two variants that differed by a single nucleotide, resulting in distinct FCS motifs that differ in one amino acid. It is predicted that one of these FCS motifs will down-regulate spike cleavability. The variant from the conjunctiva (2017) had a 6-nucleotide in-frame insertion that resulted in a longer and more exposed S1/S2 loop, which is predicted to be more accessible to the furin protease. Our studies indicate that FCoV-1 can independently persist in the gastrointestinal tract and heart of a cat over a long period of time without evidence of typical FIP signs, with intermittent viral shedding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retrotransposons have invaded eukaryotic centromeres in cycles of repeat expansion and purging, but the function of centromeric retrotransposons, if any, has remained unclear. In Arabidopsis, centromeric ATHILA retrotransposons give rise to epigenetically activated short interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in mutants in DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1), which promote histone H3 lysine-9 di-methylation (H3K9me2). Here, we show that mutants which lose both DDM1 and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) have pleiotropic developmental defects and mis-segregation of chromosome 5 during mitosis. Fertility defects are epigenetically inherited with the centromeric region of chromosome 5, and can be rescued by directing artificial small RNAs to a single family of ATHILA5 retrotransposons specifically embedded within this centromeric region. easiRNAs and H3K9me2 promote pericentromeric condensation, chromosome cohesion and proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Insertion of ATHILA silences transcription, while simultaneously making centromere function dependent on retrotransposon small RNAs, promoting the selfish survival and spread of centromeric retrotransposons. Parallels are made with the fission yeast S. pombe, where chromosome segregation depends on RNAi, and with humans, where chromosome segregation depends on both RNAi and HELLS[DDM1].</p>

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of animals is the coordination of whole-body movement. Neurons and muscles are central to this, yet coordinated movements also exist in sponges that lack these cell types. Sponges are sessile animals with a complex canal system for filter-feeding. They undergo whole-body movements resembling &#34;contractions&#34; that lead to canal closure and water expulsion. Here, we combine 3D optical coherence microscopy, pharmacology, and functional proteomics to elucidate anatomy, molecular physiology, and control of these movements. We find them driven by the relaxation of actomyosin stress fibers in epithelial canal cells, which leads to whole-body deflation via collapse of the incurrent and expansion of the excurrent system, controlled by an Akt/NO/PKG/A pathway. A concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species and secretion of proteinases and cytokines indicate an inflammation-like state reminiscent of vascular endothelial cells experiencing oscillatory shear stress. This suggests an ancient relaxant-inflammatory response of perturbed fluid-carrying systems in animals.

        <p class="abstract">Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a high-throughput experimental technique that measures the effects of thousands of mutations to a protein. These experiments can be performed on multiple homologs of a protein or on the same protein selected under multiple conditions. It is often of biological interest to identify mutations with shifted effects across homologs or conditions. However, it is challenging to determine if observed shifts arise from biological signal or experimental noise. Here, we describe a method for jointly inferring mutational effects across multiple DMS experiments while also identifying mutations that have shifted in their effects among experiments. A key aspect of our method is to regularize the inferred shifts, so that they are nonzero only when strongly supported by the data. We apply this method to DMS experiments that measure how mutations to spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2) affect cell entry. Most mutational effects are conserved between these spike homologs, but a fraction have markedly shifted. We experimentally validate a subset of the mutations inferred to have shifted effects, and confirm differences of &gt;1,000-fold in the impact of the same mutation on spike-mediated viral infection across spikes from different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, our work establishes a general approach for comparing sets of DMS experiments to identify biologically important shifts in mutational effects.

Significance StatementAmino-acid mutations to a protein have effects that can shift as the protein evolves or is put under new selective pressure. The effects of amino-acid mutations to a specific protein under a defined selective pressure can be measured by deep mutational scanning experiments. Here, we devise an approach to quantify shifts in mutational effects between experiments performed on different homologs (i.e. variants) of the same protein, or on the same protein selected under different conditions. We use this approach to compare experiments performed on three homologs of SARS-CoV-2 spike, identifying mutations that have shifted in their effect on spike-mediated viral infection by &gt;1,000 fold across SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyanobacterial CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) sequester a globally significant proportion of carbon into the biosphere. Proteinaceous microcompartments, called carboxysomes, play a critical role in CCM function, housing two enzymes to enhance CO2 fixation: carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Rubisco. Despite its importance, our current understanding of the carboxysomal CAs found in [a]-cyanobacteria, CsoSCA, remains limited, particularly regarding the regulation of its activity. Here, we present the first structural and biochemical study of CsoSCA from the cyanobacterium Cyanobium PCC7001. Our results show that the Cyanobium CsoSCA is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and forms a hexameric trimer of dimers. Comprehensive phylogenetic and mutational analyses are consistent with this regulation appearing exclusively in cyanobacterial [a]-carboxysome CAs. These findings clarify the biologically relevant oligomeric state of -carboxysomal CAs and advance our understanding of the regulation of photosynthesis in this globally dominant lineage.

One-Sentence SummaryThe carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase, CsoSCA, is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate RuBP, revealing a novel mechanism controlling key enzyme activity in cyanobacterial -carboxysomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acetylation of histones is a key post-translational modification that guides gene expression regulation. In yeast, the class I histone deacetylase containing Rpd3S complex plays a critical role in the suppression of spurious transcription by removing histone acetylation from actively transcribed genes. The S. cerevisiae Rpd3S complex has five subunits (Rpd3, Sin3, Rco1, Eaf3, and Ume1) but its subunit stoichiometry and how the complex engages nucleosomes to achieve substrate specificity remains elusive. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the complete Rpd3S complex bound to a nucleosome. Sin3 and two copies of subunits Rco1 and Eaf3 encircle the deacetylase subunit Rpd3 and coordinate the binding of Ume1. The Rpd3S complex binds both trimethylated H3 tails at position lysine 36 and makes multiple additional contacts with the nucleosomal DNA, the H2A-H2B acidic patch, and histone H3. Direct regulation via the Sin3 subunit coordinates binding of the acetylated histone substrate to achieve substrate specificity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivePancreatic islets are nutrient sensors that regulate organismal blood glucose homeostasis. Glucagon release from the pancreatic -cell is important under fasted, fed, and hypoglycemic conditions, yet metabolic regulation of -cells remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a previously unexplored role for physiological levels of leucine, which is classically regarded as a {beta}-cell fuel, in the intrinsic regulation of -cell glucagon release.

MethodsGcgCreERT:CAMPER and GcgCreERT:GCaMP6s mice were generated to perform dynamic, high-throughput functional measurements of -cell cAMP and Ca2&#43; within the intact islet. Islet perifusion assays were used for simultaneous, time-resolved measurements of glucagon and insulin release from mouse and human islets. The effects of leucine were compared with glucose and the mitochondrial fuels 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, non-metabolized leucine analog that activates glutamate dehydrogenase), -ketoisocaproate (KIC, leucine metabolite), and methyl-succinate (complex II fuel). CYN154806 (Sstr2 antagonist), diazoxide (KATP activator, which prevents Ca2&#43;-dependent exocytosis from , {beta}, and {delta}-cells), and dispersed -cells were used to inhibit islet paracrine signaling and identify -cell intrinsic effects.

ResultsMimicking the effect of glucose, leucine strongly suppressed amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, leucine dose-dependently reduced -cell cAMP at physiological concentrations, with an IC50 of 57, 440, and 1162 M at 2, 6, and 10 mM glucose, without affecting -cell Ca2&#43;. Leucine also reduced -cell cAMP in islets treated with Sstr2 antagonist or diazoxide, as well as dispersed -cells, indicating an -cell intrinsic effect. The effect of leucine was matched by KIC and the glutamate dehydrogenase activator BCH, but not methyl-succinate, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glucose, which stimulates anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, had the same suppressive effect on -cell cAMP but with lower potency. Similarly to mouse islets, leucine suppressed glucagon secretion from human islets under hypoglycemic conditions.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight an important role for physiological levels of leucine in the metabolic regulation of -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion. Leucine functions primarily through an -cell intrinsic effect that is dependent on glutamate dehydrogenase, in addition to the well-established -cell regulation by {beta}/{delta}-cell paracrine signaling. Our results suggest that mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis facilitates the glucagonostatic effect of both leucine and glucose, which cooperatively suppress -cell tone by reducing cAMP.

        <p class="abstract">MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (MET{Delta}Ex14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild type and MET{Delta}Ex14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase C helix, pointing to differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a {beta}5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for kinase domain activation in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene silencing process that exists in diverse organisms to protect genome integrity and regulate gene expression. In C. elegans, the majority of RNAi pathway proteins localize to perinuclear, phase-separated germ granules, which are comprised of sub-domains referred to as P granules, Mutator foci, Z granules, and SIMR foci. However, the protein components and function of the newly discovered SIMR foci are unknown. Here we demonstrate that HRDE-2 localizes to SIMR foci and interacts with the germline nuclear RNAi Argonaute HRDE-1. Furthermore, HRDE-1 also localizes to SIMR foci, dependent on HRDE-2, but only in its small RNA unbound state. This germ granule localization is critical to promote the small RNA binding specificity of HRDE-1 and, in the absence of HRDE-2, HRDE-1 exclusively loads CSR-class 22G-RNAs rather than WAGO-class 22G-RNAs, resulting in inappropriate H3K9me3 deposition on CSR-target genes. Thus, our study demonstrates that the recruitment of unloaded HRDE-1 to germ granules, mediated by HRDE-2, is critical to ensure that the correct small RNAs are used to guide nuclear RNA silencing in the C. elegans germline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Osteoarthritis causes progressive joint deterioration, severe morbidity, and reduced mobility in both humans and horses. Currently, osteoarthritis is diagnosed at late stages through clinical examination and radiographic imaging, hence it is challenging to address and provide timely therapeutic interventions to slow disease progression or ameliorate symptoms. Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived vesicles that play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and are potential sources for specific composite biomarker panel discovery. We here used a multi-omics strategy combining proteomics and phospholipidomics in an integral approach to identify composite biomarkers associated to purified extracellular vesicles from synovial fluid of healthy, mildly and severely osteoarthritic equine joints. Although the number of extracellular vesicles was unaffected by osteoarthritis, proteome profiling of extracellular vesicles by mass spectrometry identified 40 differentially expressed proteins (non-adjusted p&lt;0.05) in osteoarthritic joints associated with 7 significant canonical pathways in osteoarthritis. Moreover, pathway analysis unveiled changes in disease and molecular functions during osteoarthritis development. Phospholipidome profiling by mass spectrometry showed a relative increase in sphingomyelin and a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine in extracellular vesicles derived from osteoarthritic joints compared to healthy joints. Unsupervised data integration revealed positive correlations between the proteome and the phospholipidome. Comprehensive analysis showed that some phospholipids and their related proteins increased as the severity of osteoarthritis progressed, while others decreased or remained stable. Altogether our data show interrelationships between synovial fluid extracellular vesicle-associated phospholipids and proteins responding to osteoarthritis pathology and which could be explored as potential composite diagnostic biomarkers of disease.</p>
