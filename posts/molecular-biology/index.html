W.; Batters, C.; Dendooven, T.; Yang, J.; Zhang, Z.; Burt, A.; Barford, D.\nScore: 47.0, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549907\nKinetochores couple chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and transduce the energy of microtubule depolymerization to segregate the genome during cell division. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments are often initially erroneous and subject to a mitotic error correction (EC) mechanism that drives their turnover until biorientation is achieved. How this is accomplished and regulated, and how kinetochore-mediated chromosome segregation occurs at a molecular level remain major outstanding questions. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the budding yeast outer kinetochore Ndc80 and Dam1 ring complexes assembled onto microtubules. We observe coordinated interactions of the outer kinetochore complexes through multiple interfaces, in addition to a short staple within the Dam1 subunit that facilitates Dam1c ring assembly. Perturbation of these interfaces results in loss of yeast viability. Force-rupture assays indicated this is a consequence of substantial reductions in kinetochore-microtubule binding strength. EC-mediated phosphorylation of Ndc80c-Dam1c interfaces would drive complex disassembly, whereas Dam1 staple phosphorylation would promote Dam1c ring disassembly, explaining how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are destabilized and reset by the EC mechanism.\nSystematic mapping and modeling of 3D enhancer-promoter interactions in early mouse embryonic lineages reveal regulatory principles that determine the levels and cell-type specificity of gene expression\nAuthors: Murphy, D.; Salataj, E.; Di Giammartino, D. C.; Rodriguez-Hernaez, J.; Kloetgen, A.; Garg, V.; Char, E.; Uyehara, C. M.; Ee, L.-s.; Lee, U.; Stadtfeld, M.; Hadjantonakis, A.-K.; Tsirigos, A.; Polyzos, A.; Apostolou, E.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549714\nMammalian embryogenesis commences with two pivotal and binary cell fate decisions that give rise to three essential lineages, the trophectoderm (TE), the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PrE). Although key signaling pathways and transcription factors that control these early embryonic decisions have been identified, the non-coding regulatory elements via which transcriptional regulators enact these fates remain understudied. To address this gap, we have characterized, at a genome-wide scale, enhancer activity and 3D connectivity in embryo-derived stem cell lines that represent each of the early developmental fates. We observed extensive enhancer remodeling and fine-scale 3D chromatin rewiring among the three lineages, which strongly associate with transcriptional changes, although there are distinct groups of genes that are irresponsive to topological changes. In each lineage, a high degree of connectivity or hubness positively correlates with levels of gene expression and enriches for cell-type specific and essential genes. Genes within 3D hubs also show a significantly stronger probability of coregulation across lineages, compared to genes in linear proximity or within the same contact domains. By incorporating 3D chromatin features, we build a novel predictive model for transcriptional regulation (3D-HiChAT), which outperformed models that use only 1D promoter or proximal variables in predicting levels and cell-type specificity of gene expression. Using 3D-HiChAT, we performed genome-wide in silico perturbations to nominate candidate functional enhancers and hubs in each cell lineage, and with CRISPRi experiments we validated several novel enhancers that control expression of one or more genes in their respective lineages. Our study comprehensively identifies 3D regulatory hubs associated with the earliest mammalian lineages and describes their relationship to gene expression and cell identity, providing a framework to understand lineage-specific transcriptional behaviors.\nChainsaw: protein domain segmentation with fullyconvolutional neural networks\nAuthors: Wells, J.; Hawkins-Hooker, A.; Bordin, N.; Orengo, C.; Paige, B.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549732\nProtein domains are fundamental units of protein structure and play a pivotal role in understanding folding, function, evolution, and design. The advent of accurate structure prediction techniques has resulted in an influx of new structural data, making the partitioning of these structures into domains essential for inferring evolutionary relationships and functional classification. Currently, the most performant computational methods for parsing protein domains are structure-based methods that rely on unsupervised heuristics to determine the optimal segmentation. Given the availability of large curated databases of domain annotations, we find it worthwhile to revisit structure-based approaches but adopt a supervised learning approach. This paper presents Chainsaw, a novel supervised learning approach to domain parsing that achieves accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. The Chainsaw method uses a residual convolutional neural network which is trained to predict the adjacency matrix over residues, where element ai j is an estimate for the probability that residues i and j are in the same domain. Domain assignments are then derived from this soft-adjacency matrix using a non-learned algorithm that is equivalent to maximising the likelihood of the assignments given the set of pairwise probabilities expressed in the soft-adjacency matrix. We benchmark the method against recent state-of-the-art structure-based methods and show that it outperforms them, achieving an NDO score of 0.87 vs 0.80 for the next closest method when predicting a non-redundant test set of multi-domain proteins.\nMechanism of target site selection by type V-K CRISPR-associated transposases\nAuthors: George, J. T.; Acree, C.; Park, J.-U.; Kong, M.; Wiegand, T.; Pignot, Y. L.; Kellogg, E. H.; Greene, E. C.; Sternberg, S. H.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548620\nUnlike canonical CRISPR-Cas systems that rely on RNA-guided nucleases for target cleavage, CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) repurpose nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors to facilitate RNA-guided transposition of large genetic payloads. Type V-K CASTs offer several potential upsides for genome engineering, due to their compact size, easy programmability, and unidirectional integration. However, these systems are substantially less accurate than type I-F CASTs, and the molecular basis for this difference has remained elusive. Here we reveal that type V-K CASTs undergo two distinct mobilization pathways with remarkably different specificities: RNA-dependent and RNA-independent transposition. Whereas RNA-dependent transposition relies on Cas12k for accurate target selection, RNA-independent integration events are untargeted and primarily driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. The cryo-EM structure of the untargeted complex reveals a TnsB-TnsC-TniQ transpososome that encompasses two turns of a TnsC filament and otherwise resembles major architectural aspects of the Cas12k-containing transpososome. Using single-molecule experiments and genome-wide meta-analyses, we found that AT-rich sites are preferred substrates for untargeted transposition and that the TnsB transposase also imparts local specificity, which collectively determine the precise insertion site. Knowledge of these motifs allowed us to direct untargeted transposition events to specific hotspot regions of a plasmid. Finally, by exploiting TnsBs preference for on-target integration and modulating the availability of TnsC, we suppressed RNA-independent transposition events and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1%, without compromising the efficiency of on-target integration. Collectively, our results reveal the importance of dissecting target site selection mechanisms and highlight new opportunities to leverage CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.\nExtrusion fountains are hallmarks of chromosome organization emerging upon zygotic genome activation\nAuthors: Galitsyna, A.; Bykov, N.; Ulianov, S.; Veil, M.; Gao, M.; Perevoshchikova, K. Y.; Gelfand, M. S.; Razin, S. V.; Mirny, L. A.; Onichtchouk, D.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549120\nThe first activation of gene expression during development (zygotic genome activation, ZGA) is accompanied by massive changes in chromosome organization. The connection between these two processes remains unknown. Using Hi-C for zebrafish embryos, we found that chromosome folding starts by establishing \"fountains\", novel elements of chromosome organization, emerging selectively at enhancers upon ZGA. Using polymer simulations, we demonstrate that fountains can emerge as sites of targeted cohesin loading and require two-sided, yet desynchronized, loop extrusion. Specific loss of fountains upon loss of pioneer transcription factors that drive ZGA reveals a causal connection between enhancer activity and fountain formation. Finally, we show that fountains emerge in early Medaka and Xenopus embryos; moreover, we found cohesin-dependent fountain pattern on enhancers of mouse embryonic stem cells. Taken together, fountains are the first enhancer-specific elements of chromosome organization; they constitute starting points of chromosome folding during early development, likely serving as sites of targeted cohesin loading.\nA simple mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of silent chromatin.\nAuthors: Yuan, A. H.; Moazed, D.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549577\nMechanisms enabling genetically identical cells to differentially regulate gene expression are complex and central to organismal development and evolution. While gene silencing pathways involving sequence-specific recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes are prevalent in nature, examples of sequence-independent heritable gene silencing are scarce. Studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that sequence-independent propagation of heterochromatin can occur but requires numerous multisubunit protein complexes and their various activities. Such complexity has precluded a coherent articulation of the minimal requirements for heritable gene silencing by conventional approaches. Here, we take an unconventional approach to defining these requirements by engineering sequence-independent silent chromatin inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The memory-conferring mechanism is remarkably simple and requires only two proteins, one that recognizes histone H3 methylation and deacetylates histone H4, and another that recognizes unmodified H4 and catalyzes H3 methylation. These bilingual \"read-write\" proteins form an interdependent positive feedback loop capable of transmitting sequence-independent silent information over multiple generations.\nComplexity and dynamics of in organello translation landscape assessed by high-resolution mitochondrial ribosome profiling\nAuthors: Wakigawa, T.; Mito, M.; Yamashiro, H.; Tomuro, K.; Tomizawa, K.; Chujo, T.; Nagao, A.; Suzuki, T.; Wei, F.-Y.; Shichino, Y.; Suzuki, T.; Iwasaki, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549812\nEukaryotes house an additional protein synthesis system within the mitochondria. Given that mitochondrial translation dictates OXPHOS complex abundance and ATP levels in cells, exhaustive, quantitative, and high-resolution delineation of mitoribosome traversal is needed. Here, we developed a technique for high-resolution mitochondrial ribosome profiling and unveiled the tight regulation of mammalian in organello translation. Our approach assessed the stoichiometry and kinetics of mitochondrial translation flux, such as the absolute numbers of mitoribosomes on a transcript and the elongation rate, initiation rate, and lifetime rounds of translation of individual transcripts. We also surveyed the impacts of modifications at anticodon stem loop in mt-tRNAs, including all possible decorations at 34th position, by deleting the corresponding enzymes and harnessing patient-derived mtDNA A3243G cells. Moreover, retapamulin-assisted profiling and disome profiling unveiled cryptic translation initiation sites at subcognate codons and programmed mitoribosome collision sites across the mitochondrial transcriptome, respectively. Our work provides a useful resource for delineating protein synthesis within this indispensable organelle.\nTur1 regulates alternative TSS usage in Cryptococcus\nAuthors: Dang, T. T. V.; Maufrais, C.; Colin, J.; Moyrand, F.; Mouyna, I.; Coppee, J.-Y.; Onyishi, C. U.; Lipecka, J.; Guerrera, I. C.; May, R. C.; Janbon, G.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549460\nAlternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analysed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in two species of pathogenic Cryptococcus. We identified two types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in Cryptococcus, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in C. neoformans. We demonstrated here that a tur1{Delta} mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.\nRelationship Between Domain and Function of the Yeast RNase T2, Rny1p, Which Mediates rRNA Degradation upon Starvation\nAuthors: Minami, A.; Nishi, K.; Yamada, R.; Jinnai, G.; Shima, H.; Oishi, S.; Akagawa, H.; Aono, T.; Hidaka, M.; Masaki, H.; Kuzuyama, T.; Noda, Y.; Ogawa, T.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548783\nRNase T2 is found in almost all organisms and non-living viruses. Although enzymatic activity is simple, RNase T2 involves diverse and essential roles in each species. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase T2, known as Rny1p, is localized in vacuoles and mediates rRNA degradation during autophagy of ribosomes. However, whether the ribosomal degradation is selective or non-selective or whether the two pathways coexist is still being determined. We found that most ribosomes are selectively degraded, and Rsa1p involves the degradation. As described, Rny1p is vacuolar-localized; however, some are secreted outside the cell and anchored to the host cell wall. Rny1p is characteristic of having a C-terminal extension with an unknown biological role. Our biochemical analyses indicated that the C-terminal extension is not required for the rRNA degradation but for anchoring Rny1p to the cell wall. Moreover, the predicted structure of the C-terminal extension of Rny1p superimposed well with sugar-binding domain-containing proteins, suggesting that Rny1p binds the sugar chain of the cell wall using the C-terminal extension. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that fungal RNase T2 evolved independently of RNase T2 from other species. Besides, structures of C-terminal extensions of other fungal RNase T2 proteins are almost identical to that of Rny1p. RNase T2 proteins from other than fungi also have C-terminal extensions. However, their sequences, structures, and biological functions differ from fungi. As the structures of the RNase domain of eukaryotic RNase T2 proteins are almost identical, the C-terminal extension confers species-specific functions to RNase T2.\nIntegrative determination of the atomic structure of mutant huntingtin exon 1 fibrils from Huntington's disease\nAuthors: Bagherpoor Helabad, M.; Matlahov, I.; Daldrop, J. O.; Jain, G.; van der Wel, P. C. A.; Miettinen, M. S.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.549993\nNeurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is accompanied by the aggregation of fragments of the mutant huntingtin protein, a biomarker of disease progression. A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1) fragment, whose polyglutamine (polyQ) segment is expanded. Unlike amyloid fibrils from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the atomic-level structure of HttEx1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HttEx1. Atomic-resolution perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Visualizing the HttEx1 subdomains in atomic detail helps explaining the biological properties of these protein aggregates, as well as paves the way for targeting them for detection and degradation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Kinetochores couple chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and transduce the energy of microtubule depolymerization to segregate the genome during cell division. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments are often initially erroneous and subject to a mitotic error correction (EC) mechanism that drives their turnover until biorientation is achieved. How this is accomplished and regulated, and how kinetochore-mediated chromosome segregation occurs at a molecular level remain major outstanding questions. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the budding yeast outer kinetochore Ndc80 and Dam1 ring complexes assembled onto microtubules. We observe coordinated interactions of the outer kinetochore complexes through multiple interfaces, in addition to a short staple within the Dam1 subunit that facilitates Dam1c ring assembly. Perturbation of these interfaces results in loss of yeast viability. Force-rupture assays indicated this is a consequence of substantial reductions in kinetochore-microtubule binding strength. EC-mediated phosphorylation of Ndc80c-Dam1c interfaces would drive complex disassembly, whereas Dam1 staple phosphorylation would promote Dam1c ring disassembly, explaining how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are destabilized and reset by the EC mechanism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian embryogenesis commences with two pivotal and binary cell fate decisions that give rise to three essential lineages, the trophectoderm (TE), the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PrE). Although key signaling pathways and transcription factors that control these early embryonic decisions have been identified, the non-coding regulatory elements via which transcriptional regulators enact these fates remain understudied. To address this gap, we have characterized, at a genome-wide scale, enhancer activity and 3D connectivity in embryo-derived stem cell lines that represent each of the early developmental fates. We observed extensive enhancer remodeling and fine-scale 3D chromatin rewiring among the three lineages, which strongly associate with transcriptional changes, although there are distinct groups of genes that are irresponsive to topological changes. In each lineage, a high degree of connectivity or hubness positively correlates with levels of gene expression and enriches for cell-type specific and essential genes. Genes within 3D hubs also show a significantly stronger probability of coregulation across lineages, compared to genes in linear proximity or within the same contact domains. By incorporating 3D chromatin features, we build a novel predictive model for transcriptional regulation (3D-HiChAT), which outperformed models that use only 1D promoter or proximal variables in predicting levels and cell-type specificity of gene expression. Using 3D-HiChAT, we performed genome-wide in silico perturbations to nominate candidate functional enhancers and hubs in each cell lineage, and with CRISPRi experiments we validated several novel enhancers that control expression of one or more genes in their respective lineages. Our study comprehensively identifies 3D regulatory hubs associated with the earliest mammalian lineages and describes their relationship to gene expression and cell identity, providing a framework to understand lineage-specific transcriptional behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein domains are fundamental units of protein structure and play a pivotal role in understanding folding, function, evolution, and design. The advent of accurate structure prediction techniques has resulted in an influx of new structural data, making the partitioning of these structures into domains essential for inferring evolutionary relationships and functional classification. Currently, the most performant computational methods for parsing protein domains are structure-based methods that rely on unsupervised heuristics to determine the optimal segmentation. Given the availability of large curated databases of domain annotations, we find it worthwhile to revisit structure-based approaches but adopt a supervised learning approach. This paper presents Chainsaw, a novel supervised learning approach to domain parsing that achieves accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. The Chainsaw method uses a residual convolutional neural network which is trained to predict the adjacency matrix over residues, where element ai j is an estimate for the probability that residues i and j are in the same domain. Domain assignments are then derived from this soft-adjacency matrix using a non-learned algorithm that is equivalent to maximising the likelihood of the assignments given the set of pairwise probabilities expressed in the soft-adjacency matrix. We benchmark the method against recent state-of-the-art structure-based methods and show that it outperforms them, achieving an NDO score of 0.87 vs 0.80 for the next closest method when predicting a non-redundant test set of multi-domain proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unlike canonical CRISPR-Cas systems that rely on RNA-guided nucleases for target cleavage, CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) repurpose nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors to facilitate RNA-guided transposition of large genetic payloads. Type V-K CASTs offer several potential upsides for genome engineering, due to their compact size, easy programmability, and unidirectional integration. However, these systems are substantially less accurate than type I-F CASTs, and the molecular basis for this difference has remained elusive. Here we reveal that type V-K CASTs undergo two distinct mobilization pathways with remarkably different specificities: RNA-dependent and RNA-independent transposition. Whereas RNA-dependent transposition relies on Cas12k for accurate target selection, RNA-independent integration events are untargeted and primarily driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. The cryo-EM structure of the untargeted complex reveals a TnsB-TnsC-TniQ transpososome that encompasses two turns of a TnsC filament and otherwise resembles major architectural aspects of the Cas12k-containing transpososome. Using single-molecule experiments and genome-wide meta-analyses, we found that AT-rich sites are preferred substrates for untargeted transposition and that the TnsB transposase also imparts local specificity, which collectively determine the precise insertion site. Knowledge of these motifs allowed us to direct untargeted transposition events to specific hotspot regions of a plasmid. Finally, by exploiting TnsBs preference for on-target integration and modulating the availability of TnsC, we suppressed RNA-independent transposition events and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1%, without compromising the efficiency of on-target integration. Collectively, our results reveal the importance of dissecting target site selection mechanisms and highlight new opportunities to leverage CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The first activation of gene expression during development (zygotic genome activation, ZGA) is accompanied by massive changes in chromosome organization. The connection between these two processes remains unknown. Using Hi-C for zebrafish embryos, we found that chromosome folding starts by establishing &#34;fountains&#34;, novel elements of chromosome organization, emerging selectively at enhancers upon ZGA. Using polymer simulations, we demonstrate that fountains can emerge as sites of targeted cohesin loading and require two-sided, yet desynchronized, loop extrusion. Specific loss of fountains upon loss of pioneer transcription factors that drive ZGA reveals a causal connection between enhancer activity and fountain formation. Finally, we show that fountains emerge in early Medaka and Xenopus embryos; moreover, we found cohesin-dependent fountain pattern on enhancers of mouse embryonic stem cells. Taken together, fountains are the first enhancer-specific elements of chromosome organization; they constitute starting points of chromosome folding during early development, likely serving as sites of targeted cohesin loading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanisms enabling genetically identical cells to differentially regulate gene expression are complex and central to organismal development and evolution. While gene silencing pathways involving sequence-specific recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes are prevalent in nature, examples of sequence-independent heritable gene silencing are scarce. Studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that sequence-independent propagation of heterochromatin can occur but requires numerous multisubunit protein complexes and their various activities. Such complexity has precluded a coherent articulation of the minimal requirements for heritable gene silencing by conventional approaches. Here, we take an unconventional approach to defining these requirements by engineering sequence-independent silent chromatin inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The memory-conferring mechanism is remarkably simple and requires only two proteins, one that recognizes histone H3 methylation and deacetylates histone H4, and another that recognizes unmodified H4 and catalyzes H3 methylation. These bilingual &#34;read-write&#34; proteins form an interdependent positive feedback loop capable of transmitting sequence-independent silent information over multiple generations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eukaryotes house an additional protein synthesis system within the mitochondria. Given that mitochondrial translation dictates OXPHOS complex abundance and ATP levels in cells, exhaustive, quantitative, and high-resolution delineation of mitoribosome traversal is needed. Here, we developed a technique for high-resolution mitochondrial ribosome profiling and unveiled the tight regulation of mammalian in organello translation. Our approach assessed the stoichiometry and kinetics of mitochondrial translation flux, such as the absolute numbers of mitoribosomes on a transcript and the elongation rate, initiation rate, and lifetime rounds of translation of individual transcripts. We also surveyed the impacts of modifications at anticodon stem loop in mt-tRNAs, including all possible decorations at 34th position, by deleting the corresponding enzymes and harnessing patient-derived mtDNA A3243G cells. Moreover, retapamulin-assisted profiling and disome profiling unveiled cryptic translation initiation sites at subcognate codons and programmed mitoribosome collision sites across the mitochondrial transcriptome, respectively. Our work provides a useful resource for delineating protein synthesis within this indispensable organelle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analysed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in two species of pathogenic Cryptococcus. We identified two types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in Cryptococcus, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in C. neoformans. We demonstrated here that a tur1{Delta} mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNase T2 is found in almost all organisms and non-living viruses. Although enzymatic activity is simple, RNase T2 involves diverse and essential roles in each species. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase T2, known as Rny1p, is localized in vacuoles and mediates rRNA degradation during autophagy of ribosomes. However, whether the ribosomal degradation is selective or non-selective or whether the two pathways coexist is still being determined. We found that most ribosomes are selectively degraded, and Rsa1p involves the degradation. As described, Rny1p is vacuolar-localized; however, some are secreted outside the cell and anchored to the host cell wall. Rny1p is characteristic of having a C-terminal extension with an unknown biological role. Our biochemical analyses indicated that the C-terminal extension is not required for the rRNA degradation but for anchoring Rny1p to the cell wall. Moreover, the predicted structure of the C-terminal extension of Rny1p superimposed well with sugar-binding domain-containing proteins, suggesting that Rny1p binds the sugar chain of the cell wall using the C-terminal extension. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that fungal RNase T2 evolved independently of RNase T2 from other species. Besides, structures of C-terminal extensions of other fungal RNase T2 proteins are almost identical to that of Rny1p. RNase T2 proteins from other than fungi also have C-terminal extensions. However, their sequences, structures, and biological functions differ from fungi. As the structures of the RNase domain of eukaryotic RNase T2 proteins are almost identical, the C-terminal extension confers species-specific functions to RNase T2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodegeneration in Huntington&#39;s disease (HD) is accompanied by the aggregation of fragments of the mutant huntingtin protein, a biomarker of disease progression. A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1) fragment, whose polyglutamine (polyQ) segment is expanded. Unlike amyloid fibrils from Parkinson&#39;s and Alzheimer&#39;s diseases, the atomic-level structure of HttEx1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HttEx1. Atomic-resolution perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Visualizing the HttEx1 subdomains in atomic detail helps explaining the biological properties of these protein aggregates, as well as paves the way for targeting them for detection and degradation.</p>
