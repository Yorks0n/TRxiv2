COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.\nMicrobiota based personalized nutrition improves hyperglycaemia and hypertension parameters and reduces inflammation: A prospective, open label, controlled, randomized, comparative, proof of concept study\nAuthors: Kallapura, G.; Prakash, A.

Modulating gut microbiota through targeted nutrition can provide beneficial effects leading to the concept of personalized nutrition for health improvement. In this prospective clinical trial, we evaluated the impact of a microbiome-based targeted personalized diet on hyperglycaemic and hyperlipidaemic individuals. Specifically, BugSpeaks(R)- a microbiome profile test that profiles microbiota using next generation sequencing and provides personalized nutritional recommendation based on the individual microbiota profile was evaluated. The test arm [microbiome-based nutrition] showed a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c level [from 8.30 {+/-} 1.12 to 6.67 {+/-} 0.89, p\u003c0.001] after 90 days. The test arm, also showed a 5% decline in the systolic pressure whereas the control arm showed a 7% increase. Incidentally, a sub-cohort of the test arm of patients with \u003e130mm Hg systolic pressure showed a statistically significant decrease of systolic pressure by 14%. Interestingly, CRP level was also found to drop by 19.5%. Alpha diversity measures showed a significant increase in Shannon diversity measure [p\u003c0.05], after the microbiome-based personalized dietary intervention. The intervention led to a minimum 2-fold [Log2 fold change] increase in beneficial species like Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Levilactobacillus brevis, and a similar decrease in non-beneficial species like Alistipes finegoldii, Sutterella faecalis. Overall, the study indicated a net positive impact of the microbiota based personalized dietary regime on the gut microbiome and correlated clinical parameters.\n",
