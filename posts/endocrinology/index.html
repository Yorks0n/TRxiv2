COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.\nMachine learning across multiple imaging and biomarker modalities in the UK Biobank improves genetic discovery for liver fat accumulation\nAuthors: Somineni, H.; Mukherjee, S.; Amar, D.; Pei, J.; Guo, K.; Light, D.; Flynn, K.; insitro Research Team, ; Probert, C.; Soare, T.; Satapati, S.; Koller, D.; Lloyd, D. J.; O'Dushlaine, C.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.24300923\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), liver with more than 5.5% fat content, is a leading risk factor for chronic liver disease with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 30%. Though MASLD is widely recognized to be polygenic, genetic discovery has been lacking primarily due to the need for accurate and scalable phenotyping, which proves to be costly, time-intensive and variable in quality. Here, we used machine learning (ML) to predict liver fat content using three different data modalities available in the UK Biobank: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; n = 46,461 participants), plasma metabolites (n = 82,138), and anthropometric and blood-based biochemical measures (biomarkers; n = 262,927). Based on our estimates, up to 29% of participants in UKB met the criteria for MASLD. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of these estimates identified 15, 55, and 314 loci associated with liver fat predicted from DXA, metabolites and biomarkers, respectively, totalling 321 unique independent loci. In addition to replicating 9 of the 14 known loci at genome-wide significance, our GWASs identified 312 novel loci, significantly expanding our understanding of the genetic contributions to liver fat accumulation. Genetic correlation analysis indicated a strong correlation between ML-derived liver fat across modalities (rg ranging from 0.85 to 0.96) and with clinically diagnosed MASLD (rg ranging from 0.74 to 0.88), suggesting that a majority of the newly identified loci are likely to be relevant for clinical MASLD. DXA exhibited the highest precision, while biomarkers demonstrated the highest recall, respectively. Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of leveraging ML-based trait predictions across orthogonal data sources to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases.\nAssociation of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Pancreas Disease (MASPD) with Insulin Resistance\nAuthors: de Oliveira Andrade, L. J.; Matos de Oliveira, G. C.; Vinhaes Bittencourt, A. M.; Peixoto Nascimento, G.; Magno Baptista, G.; Peixoto Silva, C.; Matos de Oliveira, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.24301274\nIntroduction: Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Pancreas Disease (MASPD) is not yet a term or condition described in the medical literature. The MASPD is a relatively new and emerging condition that has garnered significant attention in the field of metabolic disorders. Objective: to investigate the association between MASPD and IR and explore the potential mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship. Materials and Methods: This cross/sectional study involved 157 participants diagnosed with MASPD based on ultrasonography criteria. Baseline demographic data were collected, including age, gender, and body mass index. Serum levels of fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile (including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high/density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low/density lipoprotein cholesterol), glycated hemoglobin and insulin were measured using standardized laboratory techniques. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all participants using convex transducer (frequency range, 3,5 MHz) by experienced radiologist blinded to the clinical data. The association between MASPD and IR was assessed using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results: The logistic regression analysis was performed to verify whether IR was a risk factor for MASPD. After adjusting for gender and age, the results demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. TyG index: OR (95% IC) 5.72 (1.90 / 16.00), P 0.021, and HOMA IR: OR (95% IC) 6.20 (2.1 / 22.00) P 0.037. Conclusion: This study presents the first description of MDASPD and its association with IR indices. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. These results suggest that MDASPD may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and further highlight the importance of pancreatic health in metabolic disorders. Keywords: Metabolic Dysfunction, Pancreatic steatosis, MASPD, Insulin Resistance.\nInsulin resistance assessed by short insulin tolerance test and its association with obesity and insulin resistance-related parameters in humans\nAuthors: Hayashishita, A.; Watanabe, T.; Suzuki, N.; Nakaya, T.; Sugimoto, A.; Yokota, I.; Ohira, H.; Nishimura, M.; Tsujino, I.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301240\nThe aim of this study was to examine the association of insulin resistance (evaluated by the short insulin tolerance test [SITT]) with parameters related to obesity and insulin resistance. We prospectively recruited controls and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), subjected them to the SITT, and calculated the K indices of the intravenous insulin tolerance test (KITT(iv)) and the subcutaneous insulin tolerance test (KITT(sc)). We compared KITT(iv) between the volunteers and patients, and examined its correlation with KITT(sc). We also examined the association of KITT(iv) with obesity, insulin resistance-related parameters, and the insulin dose required for glycemic control. A total of 24 participants (seven controls and 17 patients with T2DM) were studied. The mean KITT(iv) was significantly lower in patients with T2DM than in the controls (2.5%{+/-}2.1% vs. 4.5{+/-}1.8%). In all participants, KITT(iv) was significantly correlated with the HOMA-IR values (r=-0.601, p\u003c0.05) but not with KITT(sc) (p=0.62). KITT(iv) was correlated positively with the serum adiponectin concentration, but negatively with the visceral fat area and serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor- and branched-chain amino acids. In patients with T2DM, KITT(iv) and HOMA-IR values were significantly correlated with the total insulin dose required for glycemic control. Insulin resistance evaluated using intravenous insulin (KITT(iv)) was correlated with the HOMA-IR values, but not with the resistance evaluated using subcutaneous insulin (KITT(sc)). The degree of insulin resistance was associated with biomarkers, such as adiponectin, and with the dose of insulin required for glycemic control.\n",

Here, we used machine learning (ML) to predict liver fat content using three different data modalities available in the UK Biobank: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; n = 46,461 participants), plasma metabolites (n = 82,138), and anthropometric and blood-based biochemical measures (biomarkers; n = 262,927). Based on our estimates, up to 29% of participants in UKB met the criteria for MASLD. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of these estimates identified 15, 55, and 314 loci associated with liver fat predicted from DXA, metabolites and biomarkers, respectively, totalling 321 unique independent loci. In addition to replicating 9 of the 14 known loci at genome-wide significance, our GWASs identified 312 novel loci, significantly expanding our understanding of the genetic contributions to liver fat accumulation. Genetic correlation analysis indicated a strong correlation between ML-derived liver fat across modalities (rg ranging from 0.85 to 0.96) and with clinically diagnosed MASLD (rg ranging from 0.74 to 0.88), suggesting that a majority of the newly identified loci are likely to be relevant for clinical MASLD. DXA exhibited the highest precision, while biomarkers demonstrated the highest recall, respectively. Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of leveraging ML-based trait predictions across orthogonal data sources to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Pancreas Disease (MASPD) is not yet a term or condition described in the medical literature. The MASPD is a relatively new and emerging condition that has garnered significant attention in the field of metabolic disorders. Objective: to investigate the association between MASPD and IR and explore the potential mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship. Materials and Methods: This cross/sectional study involved 157 participants diagnosed with MASPD based on ultrasonography criteria. Baseline demographic data were collected, including age, gender, and body mass index. Serum levels of fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile (including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high/density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low/density lipoprotein cholesterol), glycated hemoglobin and insulin were measured using standardized laboratory techniques. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all participants using convex transducer (frequency range, 3,5 MHz) by experienced radiologist blinded to the clinical data. The association between MASPD and IR was assessed using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results: The logistic regression analysis was performed to verify whether IR was a risk factor for MASPD. After adjusting for gender and age, the results demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. TyG index: OR (95% IC) 5.72 (1.90 / 16.00), P 0.021, and HOMA IR: OR (95% IC) 6.20 (2.1 / 22.00) P 0.037. Conclusion: This study presents the first description of MDASPD and its association with IR indices. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. These results suggest that MDASPD may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and further highlight the importance of pancreatic health in metabolic disorders.

        <p class="abstract">The aim of this study was to examine the association of insulin resistance (evaluated by the short insulin tolerance test [SITT]) with parameters related to obesity and insulin resistance. We prospectively recruited controls and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), subjected them to the SITT, and calculated the K indices of the intravenous insulin tolerance test (KITT(iv)) and the subcutaneous insulin tolerance test (KITT(sc)). We compared KITT(iv) between the volunteers and patients, and examined its correlation with KITT(sc). We also examined the association of KITT(iv) with obesity, insulin resistance-related parameters, and the insulin dose required for glycemic control. A total of 24 participants (seven controls and 17 patients with T2DM) were studied. The mean KITT(iv) was significantly lower in patients with T2DM than in the controls (2.5%{&#43;/-}2.1% vs. 4.5{&#43;/-}1.8%). In all participants, KITT(iv) was significantly correlated with the HOMA-IR values (r=-0.601, p&lt;0.05) but not with KITT(sc) (p=0.62). KITT(iv) was correlated positively with the serum adiponectin concentration, but negatively with the visceral fat area and serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor- and branched-chain amino acids. In patients with T2DM, KITT(iv) and HOMA-IR values were significantly correlated with the total insulin dose required for glycemic control. Insulin resistance evaluated using intravenous insulin (KITT(iv)) was correlated with the HOMA-IR values, but not with the resistance evaluated using subcutaneous insulin (KITT(sc)). The degree of insulin resistance was associated with biomarkers, such as adiponectin, and with the dose of insulin required for glycemic control.</p>
