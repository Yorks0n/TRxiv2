Background: Feeding induces dopamine release in the striatum, and a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system can lead to overeating, and obesity. Studies have reported inconsistent findings of dopamine receptor (DR) positron emission tomography (PET) scans in obesity. Here we investigated the association between DR availability and overweight/obesity using Bayesian and frequentist meta-analysis.">

Studies have reported inconsistent findings of dopamine receptor (DR) positron emission tomography (PET) scans in obesity. Here we investigated the association between DR availability and overweight/obesity using Bayesian and frequentist meta-analysis. Methods: We performed a systematic search of Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science for studies which compared striatal DR availability between lean subjects and overweight/obese subjects. The standardized mean difference of DR availability was calculated after extraction of data from each study. Studies were divided into two groups according to the definition of overweight/obese subjects (BMI cutoff of 25 and 30kg/m2). Both Bayesian and conventional meta-analysis was done in R Statistical Software version 4.2.2. Results: Nine studies were eligible for inclusion in this study. Three studies with C11-raclopride, one with C11-PNHO, two with F18-fallypride, one with I123-IBZM, one with C11-NMB and one with both C11-raclopride and C11-PNHO were included. In Bayesian meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference of DR availability between lean and overweight/obese subjects markedly overlapped with zero regardless of BMI cutoff for obesity. In frequentist meta-analysis the pooled standardized mean difference of DR availability did not show the significant difference between lean and overweight/obese subjects. There was an effect of the radiopharmaceutical on the standardized mean difference of DR availability in meta-analysis of BMI cutoff of 25 kg/m2. Conclusions: Brain DR availability is not different between lean and overweight/obese subjects. However, the effect is dependent on the radiopharmaceutical and the degree of obesity. Further studies with multi-radiopharmaceutical in the same individuals are need to understand the association between DR and obesity.\nChronotype changes after sex hormone use: a prospective cohort study in transgender users of gender-affirming hormones\nAuthors: Morssinkhof, M. W. L.; Zwager, A.; van der Tuuk, K.; den Heijer, M.; van der Werf, Y. D.; Stenvers, D. J.; Broekman, B. F. P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291434\nBackgroundChronotype, an individuals preferred sleep-wake timing, is influenced by sex and age. Men report a later chronotype than women and age is associated with earlier chronotype. The sex-related changes in chronotype coincide with puberty and menopause. However, the effects of sex hormones on human chronotype remain unclear. AimTo examine the impact of 3 months of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on chronotype in transgender persons. MethodsThis study used data from 93 participants from the prospective RESTED cohort, including 49 transmasculine (TM) participants starting testosterone and 44 transfeminine (TF) participants starting estrogens and antiandrogens. Midpoint of sleep and sleep duration were measured using the ultra-short Munich ChronoType Questionnaire ({micro}MCTQ). ResultsAfter 3 months of GAHT, TM participants midpoint of sleep increased by 24 minutes (95%CI: 3 to 45), whereas TF participants midpoint of sleep decreased by 21 minutes (95%CI: -38 to -4). Total sleep duration did not change significantly in either group. ConclusionThis study provides the first prospective assessment of sex hormone use and chronotype in transgender persons, showing that GAHT can change chronotype in line with cisgender sex differences. These findings provide a basis for future studies on biological mechanisms and clinical consequences of chronotype changes.\n",
