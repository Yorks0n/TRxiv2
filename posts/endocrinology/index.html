Studies have reported inconsistent findings of dopamine receptor (DR) positron emission tomography (PET) scans in obesity. Here we investigated the association between DR availability and overweight/obesity using Bayesian and frequentist meta-analysis. MethodsWe performed a systematic search of Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science for studies which compared striatal DR availability between lean subjects and overweight/obese subjects. The standardized mean difference (Hedges g) of DR availability was calculated after extraction of data from each study. Studies were divided into two groups according to the definition of overweight/obese subjects (BMI cutoff of 25 and 30kg/m2). Both Bayesian and conventional meta-analysis was done in R Statistical Software version 4.2.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). ResultsNine studies were eligible for inclusion in this study. Three studies with C11-raclopride, one with C11-PNHO, two with F18-fallypride, one with I123-IBZM, one with C11-NMB and one with both C11-raclopride and C11-PNHO were included. In Bayesian meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference of DR availability between lean and overweight/obese subjects markedly overlapped with zero regardless of BMI cutoff for obesity. In frequentist meta-analysis the pooled standardized mean difference of DR availability did not show the significant difference between lean and overweight/obese subjects. There was an effect of the radiopharmaceutical on the standardized mean difference of DR availability in meta-analysis of BMI cutoff of 25 kg/m2. ConclusionsBrain DR availability is not different between lean and overweight/obese subjects. However, the effect is dependent on the radiopharmaceutical and the degree of obesity. Further studies with multi-radiopharmaceutical in the same individuals are need to understand the association between DR and obesity.\nAngiotensin I-Converting Enzyme type 2 expression is increased in pancreatic islets of type 2 diabetic donors.\nAuthors: Fignani, D.; Pedace, E.; Licata, G.; Grieco, G. E.; Aiello, E.; de Luca, C.; Marselli, L.; Marchetti, P.; Sebastiani, G.; Dotta, F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.23291752\nAimsAngiotensin I-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), a pivotal SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been shown to be expressed in multiple cells including human pancreatic beta-cells. A putative bidirectional relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes has been suggested, confirming the hypothesis that viral infection in beta-cells may lead to new-onset diabetes or to a worse glycometabolic control in diabetic patients. However, whether ACE2 expression levels are altered in beta-cells of diabetic patients has not yet been investigated. Here, we aimed at elucidating the in-situ expression pattern of ACE2 in T2D respect to non-diabetic donors which may account for a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in beta-cells. Material and methodsACE2 Immunofluorescence analysis using two antibodies alongside with insulin staining was performed on FFPE pancreatic sections obtained from n=20 T2D and n=20 non-diabetic multiorgan donors. Intensity and colocalization analyses were performed on a total of 1082 pancreatic islets. Macrophages detection was performed using anti-CD68 immunohistochemistry on serial sections from the same donors. ResultsUsing two different antibodies, ACE2 expression was confirmed in beta-cells and in pancreas microvasculature. ACE2 expression was increased in pancreatic islets of T2D donors in comparison to non-diabetic controls alongside with a higher colocalization rate between ACE2 and insulin using both anti-ACE2 antibodies. CD68+ cells tend to be increased in T2D pancreata, in line with higher ACE2 expression observed in serial sections. ConclusionsHigher ACE2 expression in T2D islets might increase their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during COVID-19 in T2D patients, thus worsening glycometabolic outcomes and disease severity.\n",
