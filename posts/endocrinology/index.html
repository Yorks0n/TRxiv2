X.; Bian, Z.-X.\nScore: 61.6, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299358\nDiabetes is associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability and mortality. COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.\nMachine learning across multiple imaging and biomarker modalities in the UK Biobank improves genetic discovery for liver fat accumulation\nAuthors: Somineni, H.; Mukherjee, S.; Amar, D.; Pei, J.; Guo, K.; Light, D.; Flynn, K.; insitro Research Team, ; Probert, C.; Soare, T.; Satapati, S.; Koller, D.; Lloyd, D. J.; O'Dushlaine, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.24300923\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), liver with more than 5.5% fat content, is a leading risk factor for chronic liver disease with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 30%. Though MASLD is widely recognized to be polygenic, genetic discovery has been lacking primarily due to the need for accurate and scalable phenotyping, which proves to be costly, time-intensive and variable in quality. Here, we used machine learning (ML) to predict liver fat content using three different data modalities available in the UK Biobank: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; n = 46,461 participants), plasma metabolites (n = 82,138), and anthropometric and blood-based biochemical measures (biomarkers; n = 262,927). Based on our estimates, up to 29% of participants in UKB met the criteria for MASLD. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of these estimates identified 15, 55, and 314 loci associated with liver fat predicted from DXA, metabolites and biomarkers, respectively, totalling 321 unique independent loci. In addition to replicating 9 of the 14 known loci at genome-wide significance, our GWASs identified 312 novel loci, significantly expanding our understanding of the genetic contributions to liver fat accumulation. Genetic correlation analysis indicated a strong correlation between ML-derived liver fat across modalities (rg ranging from 0.85 to 0.96) and with clinically diagnosed MASLD (rg ranging from 0.74 to 0.88), suggesting that a majority of the newly identified loci are likely to be relevant for clinical MASLD. DXA exhibited the highest precision, while biomarkers demonstrated the highest recall, respectively. Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of leveraging ML-based trait predictions across orthogonal data sources to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases.\nVitamin D for glycemic control: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF)\nAuthors: Sivapiromrat, A. K.; Hunt, W. R.; Alvarez, J. A.; Ziegler, T. R.; Tangpricha, V.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300862\nIndividuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) often incur damage to pancreas tissue due to a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, leading to altered chloride transport on epithelial surfaces and subsequent development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the development of CFRD. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a high-dose bolus of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on glycemic control. This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in adults with CF hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE). Glycemic control was assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose levels before and 12 months after the study intervention. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, participants were randomly assigned to a single dose of oral vitamin D3 (250,000 IU) or placebo, and subsequently, received 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo every other week, beginning at month 3 and ending on month 12. Fifty of the 91 participants in the parent study were eligible for the secondary analysis. There were no differences in 12-month changes in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose in patients randomized to vitamin D or placebo. A high-dose bolus of vitamin D3 followed by maintenance vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve glycemic control in patients with CF.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) often incur damage to pancreas tissue due to a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, leading to altered chloride transport on epithelial surfaces and subsequent development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the development of CFRD. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a high-dose bolus of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on glycemic control. This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in adults with CF hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE). Glycemic control was assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose levels before and 12 months after the study intervention. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, participants were randomly assigned to a single dose of oral vitamin D3 (250,000 IU) or placebo, and subsequently, received 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo every other week, beginning at month 3 and ending on month 12. Fifty of the 91 participants in the parent study were eligible for the secondary analysis. There were no differences in 12-month changes in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose in patients randomized to vitamin D or placebo. A high-dose bolus of vitamin D3 followed by maintenance vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve glycemic control in patients with CF.</p>
