K.; Lin, C.; Zhang, J.; Bao, G.; ZHANG, Y.; Xu, S.; Luo, J.; Yuan, S.; Wong, H. L. X.; Bian, Z.-X.\nScore: 51.9, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23299358\nDiabetes is associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability and mortality. COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.\nVitamin D for glycemic control: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF)\nAuthors: Sivapiromrat, A. K.; Hunt, W. R.; Alvarez, J. A.; Ziegler, T. R.; Tangpricha, V.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300862\nIndividuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) often incur damage to pancreas tissue due to a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, leading to altered chloride transport on epithelial surfaces and subsequent development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the development of CFRD. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a high-dose bolus of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on glycemic control. This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in adults with CF hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE). Glycemic control was assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose levels before and 12 months after the study intervention. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, participants were randomly assigned to a single dose of oral vitamin D3 (250,000 IU) or placebo, and subsequently, received 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo every other week, beginning at month 3 and ending on month 12. Fifty of the 91 participants in the parent study were eligible for the secondary analysis. There were no differences in 12-month changes in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose in patients randomized to vitamin D or placebo. A high-dose bolus of vitamin D3 followed by maintenance vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve glycemic control in patients with CF.\nVitamin D and Prebiotics for Intestinal Health in Cystic Fibrosis: Rationale and design for a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2 x 2 trial of administration of prebiotics and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (Pre-D Trial) in adults with cystic fibrosis\nAuthors: Sivapiromrat, A. K.; Suppakitjanusant, P.; Wang, Y.; Binongo, J.; Hunt, W. R.; Gewirtz, A.; Alvarez, J. A.; Hu, C.; Weinstein, S.; Jathal, I.; Ziegler, T. R.; Tangpricha, V.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300860\nIndividuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have dysfunctional intestinal microbiota and increased gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation also known as GI dysbiosis. It is hypothesized that administration of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) together with a prebiotic (inulin) will be effective, and possibly additive or synergistic, in reducing CF-related GI dysbiosis and improving intestinal functions. Thus, a 2 x 2 factorial design, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was proposed to test this hypothesis. Forty adult participants with CF will be block-randomized into one of four groups: 1) high-dose oral vitamin D3 (50,000 IU weekly) plus oral prebiotic placebo daily; 2) oral prebiotic (12 g inulin daily) plus oral placebo vitamin D3 weekly; 3) combined oral vitamin D3 weekly and oral prebiotic inulin daily; and 4) oral vitamin D3 placebo weekly and oral prebiotic placebo. The primary endpoints will include 12-week changes in the reduced relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria, and gut microbiota richness and diversity before and after the intervention. This clinical study will examine whether vitamin D3 with or without prebiotics will improve intestinal health and reduce GI dysbiosis, which in turn, should improve health outcomes and quality of life of patients with CF.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have dysfunctional intestinal microbiota and increased gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation also known as GI dysbiosis. It is hypothesized that administration of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) together with a prebiotic (inulin) will be effective, and possibly additive or synergistic, in reducing CF-related GI dysbiosis and improving intestinal functions. Thus, a 2 x 2 factorial design, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial was proposed to test this hypothesis. Forty adult participants with CF will be block-randomized into one of four groups: 1) high-dose oral vitamin D3 (50,000 IU weekly) plus oral prebiotic placebo daily; 2) oral prebiotic (12 g inulin daily) plus oral placebo vitamin D3 weekly; 3) combined oral vitamin D3 weekly and oral prebiotic inulin daily; and 4) oral vitamin D3 placebo weekly and oral prebiotic placebo. The primary endpoints will include 12-week changes in the reduced relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria, and gut microbiota richness and diversity before and after the intervention. This clinical study will examine whether vitamin D3 with or without prebiotics will improve intestinal health and reduce GI dysbiosis, which in turn, should improve health outcomes and quality of life of patients with CF.</p>
