COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.\nAssociation of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Pancreas Disease (MASPD) with Insulin Resistance\nAuthors: de Oliveira Andrade, L. J.; Matos de Oliveira, G. C.; Vinhaes Bittencourt, A.

The MASPD is a relatively new and emerging condition that has garnered significant attention in the field of metabolic disorders. Objectiveto investigate the association between MASPD and IR and explore the potential mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship. Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study involved 157 participants diagnosed with MASPD based on ultrasonography criteria. Baseline demographic data were collected, including age, gender, and body mass index. Serum levels of fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile (including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), glycated hemoglobin and insulin were measured using standardized laboratory techniques. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all participants using convex transducer (frequency range, 3,5 MHz) by experienced radiologist blinded to the clinical data. The association between MASPD and IR was assessed using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. ResultsThe logistic regression analysis was performed to verify whether IR was a risk factor for MASPD. After adjusting for gender and age, the results demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. TyG index: OR (95% IC) 5.72 (1.90 - 16.00), P 0.021, and HOMA -IR: OR (95% IC) 6.20 (2.1 - 22.00) P 0.037. ConclusionThis study presents the first description of MDASPD and its association with IR indices. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between MDASPD and markers of IR. These results suggest that MDASPD may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and further highlight the importance of pancreatic health in metabolic disorders.\nPrevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and its association with glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Ekpor, E.; Akyirem, S.; Adade Duodu, P.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300699\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver (MAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are interconnected metabolic disorders that pose serious repercussions on health, yet a comprehensive understanding of the extent of their co-occurrence in Africa is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MAFLD and its association with glycemic control (HbA1c) in persons with T2D in Africa. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Global Health, and Web of Science from their inception to December 6, 2023. Data on MAFLD prevalence and correlation coefficients for the association with glycemic control were pooled in random effect meta-analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis of MAFLD prevalence, while 2 incorporated in the analysis of the association between MAFLD and glycemic control. The pooled prevalence of MAFLD in persons with T2D was 48.1% (95% CI: 36.1-60.3). By region, the prevalence recorded were 44.7% (95% CI: 28.7-62.0) in sub-Saharan Africa and 55.3% (95% CI: 36.2-73.0) in Northern Africa. We observe an increasing trend in MAFLD prevalence, recording 55.1% (95% CI: 43.6- 66.1) in the recent five years. There was a weak positive correlation between MAFLD and HbA1c (r = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.47). There is a high prevalence of MAFLD in persons with T2D in Africa, with a suggested link between MAFLD and suboptimal glycemic control.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver (MAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are interconnected metabolic disorders that pose serious repercussions on health, yet a comprehensive understanding of the extent of their co-occurrence in Africa is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MAFLD and its association with glycemic control (HbA1c) in persons with T2D in Africa. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Global Health, and Web of Science from their inception to December 6, 2023. Data on MAFLD prevalence and correlation coefficients for the association with glycemic control were pooled in random effect meta-analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis of MAFLD prevalence, while 2 incorporated in the analysis of the association between MAFLD and glycemic control. The pooled prevalence of MAFLD in persons with T2D was 48.1% (95% CI: 36.1-60.3). By region, the prevalence recorded were 44.7% (95% CI: 28.7-62.0) in sub-Saharan Africa and 55.3% (95% CI: 36.2-73.0) in Northern Africa. We observe an increasing trend in MAFLD prevalence, recording 55.1% (95% CI: 43.6- 66.1) in the recent five years. There was a weak positive correlation between MAFLD and HbA1c (r = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.47). There is a high prevalence of MAFLD in persons with T2D in Africa, with a suggested link between MAFLD and suboptimal glycemic control.</p>
