Here, we sought to determine the effect of endogenous GLP-1 on prandial counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia after GB. Glucose fluxes, and islet-cell and gut hormone responses before and after mixed-meal ingestion were compared during a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic ({bsim}3.2 mmol/l) clamp with and without a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist exendin-(9-39) (Ex-9) in non-diabetic subjects with prior GB compared to matched subjects with SG and non-surgical controls. In this setting, GLP-1R blockade had no effect on insulin secretion or insulin action, whereas prandial glucagon was enhanced in all 3 groups. Ex-9 infusion raised prandial EGP response to hypoglycemia in every GB subject but had no consistent effects on EGP among subjects with SG or non-operated controls (P \u003c 0.05 for interaction). These results indicate that impaired post-meal glucose counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia after GB is partly mediated by endogenous GLP-1, highlighting a novel mechanism of action of GLP-1R antagonists for the treatment of prandial hypoglycemia in this population.\nMicrobiota based personalized nutrition improves hyperglycaemia and hypertension parameters and reduces inflammation: A prospective, open label, controlled, randomized, comparative, proof of concept study\nAuthors: Kallapura, G.; Prakash, A. S.; Sankaran, K.; Manjappa, P.; Chaudhary, P.; Ambhore, S.; Dhar, D.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.23300515\nRecent studies suggest that gut microbiota composition, abundance and diversity can influence many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Modulating gut microbiota through targeted nutrition can provide beneficial effects leading to the concept of personalized nutrition for health improvement. In this prospective clinical trial, we evaluated the impact of a microbiome-based targeted personalized diet on hyperglycaemic and hyperlipidaemic individuals. Specifically, BugSpeaks(R)- a microbiome profile test that profiles microbiota using next generation sequencing and provides personalized nutritional recommendation based on the individual microbiota profile was evaluated. The test arm [microbiome-based nutrition] showed a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c level [from 8.30 {+/-} 1.12 to 6.67 {+/-} 0.89, p\u003c0.001] after 90 days. The test arm, also showed a 5% decline in the systolic pressure whereas the control arm showed a 7% increase. Incidentally, a sub-cohort of the test arm of patients with \u003e130mm Hg systolic pressure showed a statistically significant decrease of systolic pressure by 14%. Interestingly, CRP level was also found to drop by 19.5%. Alpha diversity measures showed a significant increase in Shannon diversity measure [p\u003c0.05], after the microbiome-based personalized dietary intervention. The intervention led to a minimum 2-fold [Log2 fold change] increase in beneficial species like Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Levilactobacillus brevis, and a similar decrease in non-beneficial species like Alistipes finegoldii, Sutterella faecalis. Overall, the study indicated a net positive impact of the microbiota based personalized dietary regime on the gut microbiome and correlated clinical parameters.\nIncidence and Trends in Ischemic Stroke and Mortality in Patients with and Without Type 2 Diabetes in Taiwan 2000-2018\nAuthors: Yen, F.-S.; Wei, C.-C.; Hsu, T.-J.; Shih, Y.-H.; Yeh, Y. K.; Hsu, C.-C.; Hwu, C.-M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300417\nBACKGROUNDStroke has a significant impact on life expectancy, comparable to that of cardiovascular disease in Asia. We conducted this longitudinal study to examine the incidence of ischemic stroke and 30-day mortality among persons with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also compared outcomes between those over and under 60 years and between men and women. METHODSWe enrolled participants from the 2000 to 2018 National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to examine the outcomes. RESULTSThe incidence of in-hospital ischemic stroke in patients with and without T2D had significant reductions of 64.42% and 55.63%, respectively. The relative risk of stroke associated with diabetes remained significantly higher (2.01 to 2.33 times) than non-diabetes. The relative risk of stroke in patients under 60 with T2D was 2.56 to 4.36 times higher than in those without T2D. Between 2000 and 2018, there was a significant 83.24% and 88.55% reduction in the risk of 30-day mortality after stroke in patients with and without T2D. There was no significant increase in the risk of 30-day mortality in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. However, the relative risk of death from stroke in patients under 60 years with diabetes was 1.63 to 2.49 times higher than in those without diabetes. CONCLUSIONSThis nationwide cohort study showed that the incidence of in-hospital ischemic stroke and 30-day mortality in patients with and without T2D exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 2000 to 2018. Patients with T2D had about twice the relative risk of ischemic stroke compared to those without T2D.\nIndividual effect of diet on postprandial glycemic response and its relationship with gut microbiome profile in healthy subjects: protocol for a series of randomized N-of-1 trials\nAuthors: Zamparette, C. P.; Teixeira, B. L.; Cruz, G. N. F.; FIlho, V. B.; de Oliveira, L. F. V.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300429\nBackgroundType 2 diabetes causes over a million deaths annually, ranking in the top ten causes of death worldwide. Glycemic control through dietary adequacy is essential for treatment success and disease prevention. Recent evidence indicates that the glycemic response to various foods varies from individual to individual. The intestinal microbiome is seen as a potential key player, mediating the effect of foods on glycemic response. By design, however, most published studies cannot separate variation in the individual treatment effects (ITE) of different diets from within-individual variability of glycemic responses. In this context, the present study aims to assess the heterogeneity in the ITE of diet on glycemic response and investigate the relevance of the intestinal microbiome profile as a predictor of this heterogeneity. MethodsThis study is a series of N-of-1 randomized clinical trials. Each participant will undergo five treatment cycles of two prescribed diets (low-carb versus vegan) in one of two randomly chosen treatment sequences (ABBABAABBA or BAABABBAAB). The primary outcome is the positive incremental area-under-the-curve (iAUC) of the postprandial interstitial fluid glucose measured within 2 hours of meal consumption. The trial plans to recruit 80 healthy volunteers with ages between 18 and 60. Fecal samples will be collected at baseline for microbiome analysis by metagenomics shotgun technique. Random effects linear models will be used for the primary analysis. DiscussionWhile significant variation of individual effects warrants personalized interventions, it is well-known that glycemic responses to the same food, in the same individual, vary from occasion to occasion. Yet, most clinical studies are based on designs that are incapable of separating ITE variation from within-individual variability. This is a major limitation since the personalization of dietary interventions is only justified by clinically relevant heterogeneity of individual-level effects. In this study, if significant ITE variation is indeed observed, then we will also be able to estimate the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the expected diet effects. This is essential to identify predictive biomarkers, which can identify those who intrinsically benefit the most from which diet, going beyond pure associations with glycemic response. Conversely, observing negligible ITE variation in a large series of N-of-1 trials would cast major doubts on the relevance of personalizing dietary interventions for glycemic control. Therefore, the present study represents a major step toward understanding the clinical value of microbiome-driven precision nutrition.\n",

The test arm [microbiome-based nutrition] showed a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c level [from 8.30 {&#43;/-} 1.12 to 6.67 {&#43;/-} 0.89, p&lt;0.001] after 90 days. The test arm, also showed a 5% decline in the systolic pressure whereas the control arm showed a 7% increase. Incidentally, a sub-cohort of the test arm of patients with &gt;130mm Hg systolic pressure showed a statistically significant decrease of systolic pressure by 14%. Interestingly, CRP level was also found to drop by 19.5%. Alpha diversity measures showed a significant increase in Shannon diversity measure [p&lt;0.05], after the microbiome-based personalized dietary intervention. The intervention led to a minimum 2-fold [Log2 fold change] increase in beneficial species like Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, Bifidobacterium angulatum, Levilactobacillus brevis, and a similar decrease in non-beneficial species like Alistipes finegoldii, Sutterella faecalis. Overall, the study indicated a net positive impact of the microbiota based personalized dietary regime on the gut microbiome and correlated clinical parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDStroke has a significant impact on life expectancy, comparable to that of cardiovascular disease in Asia. We conducted this longitudinal study to examine the incidence of ischemic stroke and 30-day mortality among persons with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also compared outcomes between those over and under 60 years and between men and women.

METHODSWe enrolled participants from the 2000 to 2018 National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to examine the outcomes.

RESULTSThe incidence of in-hospital ischemic stroke in patients with and without T2D had significant reductions of 64.42% and 55.63%, respectively. The relative risk of stroke associated with diabetes remained significantly higher (2.01 to 2.33 times) than non-diabetes. The relative risk of stroke in patients under 60 with T2D was 2.56 to 4.36 times higher than in those without T2D. Between 2000 and 2018, there was a significant 83.24% and 88.55% reduction in the risk of 30-day mortality after stroke in patients with and without T2D. There was no significant increase in the risk of 30-day mortality in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. However, the relative risk of death from stroke in patients under 60 years with diabetes was 1.63 to 2.49 times higher than in those without diabetes.

CONCLUSIONSThis nationwide cohort study showed that the incidence of in-hospital ischemic stroke and 30-day mortality in patients with and without T2D exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 2000 to 2018. Patients with T2D had about twice the relative risk of ischemic stroke compared to those without T2D.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundType 2 diabetes causes over a million deaths annually, ranking in the top ten causes of death worldwide. Glycemic control through dietary adequacy is essential for treatment success and disease prevention. Recent evidence indicates that the glycemic response to various foods varies from individual to individual. The intestinal microbiome is seen as a potential key player, mediating the effect of foods on glycemic response. By design, however, most published studies cannot separate variation in the individual treatment effects (ITE) of different diets from within-individual variability of glycemic responses. In this context, the present study aims to assess the heterogeneity in the ITE of diet on glycemic response and investigate the relevance of the intestinal microbiome profile as a predictor of this heterogeneity.

MethodsThis study is a series of N-of-1 randomized clinical trials. Each participant will undergo five treatment cycles of two prescribed diets (low-carb versus vegan) in one of two randomly chosen treatment sequences (ABBABAABBA or BAABABBAAB). The primary outcome is the positive incremental area-under-the-curve (iAUC) of the postprandial interstitial fluid glucose measured within 2 hours of meal consumption. The trial plans to recruit 80 healthy volunteers with ages between 18 and 60. Fecal samples will be collected at baseline for microbiome analysis by metagenomics shotgun technique. Random effects linear models will be used for the primary analysis.

DiscussionWhile significant variation of individual effects warrants personalized interventions, it is well-known that glycemic responses to the same food, in the same individual, vary from occasion to occasion. Yet, most clinical studies are based on designs that are incapable of separating ITE variation from within-individual variability. This is a major limitation since the personalization of dietary interventions is only justified by clinically relevant heterogeneity of individual-level effects. In this study, if significant ITE variation is indeed observed, then we will also be able to estimate the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the expected diet effects. This is essential to identify predictive biomarkers, which can identify those who intrinsically benefit the most from which diet, going beyond pure associations with glycemic response. Conversely, observing negligible ITE variation in a large series of N-of-1 trials would cast major doubts on the relevance of personalizing dietary interventions for glycemic control. Therefore, the present study represents a major step toward understanding the clinical value of microbiome-driven precision nutrition.</p>
