C.; Scrape, S.; Pannu, S. R.; Liu, S.-L.; Vilgelm, A.; Wijeratne, S.; Bednash, J. S.; Demberg, T.; Funderburg, N. T.; Liyanage, N.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298322\nClinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.\nThe more symptoms the better? Covid-19 vaccine side effects and long-term neutralizing antibody response\nAuthors: Dutcher, E. G.; Epel, E. S.; Mason, A. E.; Hecht, F. M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 272.0, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nCountry wide surveillance reveals prevalent artemisinin partial resistance mutations with evidence for multiple origins and expansion of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations in northwest Tanzania\nAuthors: Juliano, J. J.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Simkin, A.; Fola, A. A.; Lyimo, B. M.; Perus, D.; Bakari, C.; Madebe, R. A.; Seth, M. D.; Mandara, C. I.; Popkin-Hall, Z. R.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Niare, K.; MacInnis, B.; Francis, F.; Mbwambo, D.; Garimo, I.; Chacky, F.; Aaron, S.; Lusasi, A.; Molteni, F.; Njau, R.; Lazaro, S.; Mohamed, A.; Bailey, J. A.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298207\nBackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526). InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.\nPhenotypic and genomic analysis of a large-scale Corynebacterium diphtheriae outbreak among migrant populations in Europe\nAuthors: Hoefer, A.; Seth-Smith, H. M.; Palma, F.; Schindler, S.; Freschi, L.; Dangel, A.; Berger, A.; D'Aeth, J. C.; 2022 European diphtheria Consortium, ; Indra, A.; Fry, N. K.; Palm, D.; Sing, A.; Brisse, S.; Egli, A.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23297228\nBackground. Increased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak. Methods. All 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied. Results. Four major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020. Conclusions. The multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.\nHigh prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent Plasmodium falciparum infections in Urban Bouake, Cote dIvoire, but no hrp2 deletions: Implications for Malaria Control\nAuthors: SAGNA, A. B.; Gebre, Y.; Vera-Arias, C. A.; Traore, D. F.; Tchekoi, B. N.; Assi, S. B.; Koffi, A. A.; Rogier, C.; Remoue, F.; Koepfli, C.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298263\nAsymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic settings, yet diagnosing these infections remains challenging because they are often below the limit of detection of conventional light microscopy (LM) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Deletions of the hrp2/3 gene, encoding the protein detected by the most sensitive class of RDTs, present a further threat. In this study, the prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent P. falciparum infections was characterized in the rainy season in the city of Bouake, Central Cote dIvoire. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine neighborhoods of Bouake, Cote dIvoire, in 2016. Matched LM, RDTs, and varATS qPCR, were used to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections and to compare the performance of the different diagnostic methods. P. falciparum hrp2/3 deletions were typed by digital PCR. Among 2313 individuals, malaria prevalence was 10.8% by microscopy, 13.0% by RDT, 35.1% by qPCR, and 37.3% (863/2313) when all three methods were combined. 96.4% (832/863) of individuals with P. falciparum infections did not report a recent fever. 57.1% (493/863) of infections were sub-patent. The prevalence was highly heterogeneous across the neighborhoods, ranging from 15% to 55.2%, and differed among age groups (\u003c5 years: 17.7%, 5-14 years: 42.7%, [\u0026ge;]15 years: 35.9%). Compared to varATS qPCR, LM and RDT had a low sensitivity of 24.3% and 34.2%, respectively, although both methods were highly specific (\u003e96%). Sub-microscopic malaria infections were more prevalent in [\u0026ge;]15-year-olds (69.9%, 349/499) and in the neighborhood of Dar es Salam (75.9%, 44/58). No hrp2 deletions were observed, and two samples carried hrp3 deletion/wild-type mixed infections. The high prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections prompts the implementation of strategies targeting these parasite reservoirs to achieve reductions in malaria burden in this high-transmission city of Cote dIvoire.\nPublished benefits of ivermectin use in Itajai, Brazil for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality are entirely explained by statistical artefacts\nAuthors: Mills, R.; Pecanha Antonio, A. C.; Tucker-Kellogg, G.\nScore: 423.3, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924\nBackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020. MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect. ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship. ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.\nOne year health outcomes associated with systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Leavy, O. C.; Russell, R. J.; Harrison, E. M.; Lone, N. I.; Kerr, S.; Docherty, A. B.; Sheikh, A.; Richardson, M.; Elneima, O.; Greening, N. J.; Harris, V. C.; Houchen-Wolloff, L.; McAuley, H. J.

G.; Jolley, C.; Thompson, A. R.; Chalder, T.; Davies, M. J.; De Soyza, A.; Geddes, J. R.; Greenhalf, W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.23298162\nBackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed. Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge\nComplement dysregulation is a predictive and therapeutically amenable feature of long COVID\nAuthors: Baillie, K.; Davies, H. E.; Keat, S. B. K.; Ladell, K.; Miners, K. L.; Jones, S. A.; Mellou, E.; Toonen, E. J. M.; Price, D. A.; Morgan, B. P.; Zelek, W. M.\nScore: 132.7, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597\nBackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID. MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID. FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID. FundingThis work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (COV-LT2-0041), the PolyBio Research Foundation, and the UK Dementia Research Institute.\nA multi-hospital, clinician-initiated bacterial genomics program to investigate treatment failure in severe Staphylococcus aureus infections\nAuthors: Giulieri, S. G.; Leroi, M.; Daniel, D.; Chean, R.; Bond, K.; Walker, H.; Holmes, N.; Mothobi, N.; Alexander, A.; Jenney, A.; Beckett, C.; Mahony, A.; Stevens, K.; Sherry, N.; Howden, B. P.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297384\nBacterial genomics is increasingly used for infectious diseases surveillance, outbreak control and prediction of antibiotic resistance. With expanding availability of rapid whole-genome sequencing, bacterial genomics data could become a valuable tool for clinicians managing bacterial infections, driving precision medicine strategies. Here, we present a novel clinician-driven bacterial genomics framework that applies within-patient evolutionary analysis to identify in real-time microbial genetic changes that have an impact on the outcome of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections, a strategy that is increasingly used in cancer genomics. Our approach uses a combination of bacterial genomics and novel microbiological testing to identify and track bacterial adaptive mutations that underlie antibiotic treatment failure. We show real-life examples of the impact of our approach and propose a roadmap for the use of bacterial genomics to advance the management of severe bacterial infections.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Clinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high.

MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform.

FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526).

InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background. Increased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak. Methods. All 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied. Results. Four major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020. Conclusions. The multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic settings, yet diagnosing these infections remains challenging because they are often below the limit of detection of conventional light microscopy (LM) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Deletions of the hrp2/3 gene, encoding the protein detected by the most sensitive class of RDTs, present a further threat. In this study, the prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent P. falciparum infections was characterized in the rainy season in the city of Bouake, Central Cote dIvoire. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine neighborhoods of Bouake, Cote dIvoire, in 2016. Matched LM, RDTs, and varATS qPCR, were used to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections and to compare the performance of the different diagnostic methods. P. falciparum hrp2/3 deletions were typed by digital PCR. Among 2313 individuals, malaria prevalence was 10.8% by microscopy, 13.0% by RDT, 35.1% by qPCR, and 37.3% (863/2313) when all three methods were combined. 96.4% (832/863) of individuals with P. falciparum infections did not report a recent fever. 57.1% (493/863) of infections were sub-patent. The prevalence was highly heterogeneous across the neighborhoods, ranging from 15% to 55.2%, and differed among age groups (&lt;5 years: 17.7%, 5-14 years: 42.7%, [&amp;ge;]15 years: 35.9%). Compared to varATS qPCR, LM and RDT had a low sensitivity of 24.3% and 34.2%, respectively, although both methods were highly specific (&gt;96%). Sub-microscopic malaria infections were more prevalent in [&amp;ge;]15-year-olds (69.9%, 349/499) and in the neighborhood of Dar es Salam (75.9%, 44/58). No hrp2 deletions were observed, and two samples carried hrp3 deletion/wild-type mixed infections. The high prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections prompts the implementation of strategies targeting these parasite reservoirs to achieve reductions in malaria burden in this high-transmission city of Cote dIvoire.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020.

MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect.

ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship.

ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge.

MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias.

FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups.

InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.

Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID.

MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID.

FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID.

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial genomics is increasingly used for infectious diseases surveillance, outbreak control and prediction of antibiotic resistance. With expanding availability of rapid whole-genome sequencing, bacterial genomics data could become a valuable tool for clinicians managing bacterial infections, driving precision medicine strategies. Here, we present a novel clinician-driven bacterial genomics framework that applies within-patient evolutionary analysis to identify in real-time microbial genetic changes that have an impact on the outcome of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections, a strategy that is increasingly used in cancer genomics. Our approach uses a combination of bacterial genomics and novel microbiological testing to identify and track bacterial adaptive mutations that underlie antibiotic treatment failure. We show real-life examples of the impact of our approach and propose a roadmap for the use of bacterial genomics to advance the management of severe bacterial infections.</p>
