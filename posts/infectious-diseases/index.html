A.; Bailey, C.\nScore: 123.8, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296100\nObjective Vaccination reduces the risk of acute COVID-19 in children, but it is less clear whether it protects against long COVID. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against long COVID in children aged 5 to 17 years. Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from 17 health systems in the RECOVER PCORnet electronic health record (EHR) Program for visits between vaccine availability, and October 29, 2022. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate VE against long COVID with matching on age group (5 to 11, 12 to 17) and time period and adjustment for sex, ethnicity, health system, comorbidity burden, and pre-exposure health care utilization. We examined both probable (symptom-based) and diagnosed long COVID in the year following vaccination. Results The vaccination rate was 56% in the cohort of 1,037,936 children. The incidence of probably long COVID was 4.5% among patients with COVID-19, while diagnosed long COVID was 0.7%. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness within 12 months was 35.4% (95 CI 24.5 - 44.5) against probable long COVID and 41.7% (15.0- 60.0) against diagnosed long COVID. VE was higher for adolescents 50.3% [36.3 - 61.0]) than children aged 5-11 (23.8% [4.9 -39.0]). VE was higher at 6 months (61.4% [51.0 - 69.6]), but decreased to 10.6% (-26.8 - 37.0%) at 18 months. Discussion This large retrospective study shows a moderate protective effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against long COVID. The effect is stronger in adolescents, who have higher risk of long COVID, and wanes over time. Understanding VE mechanism against long COVID requires more study, including EHR sources and prospective data.

L.; Essink, B.; Brosz, A.; Tomassini, J. E.; Girard, B.; Wu, K.; Edwards, D. K.; Nasir, A.; Lee, D.; Avena, L. E.; Feng, J.; Deng, W.; Montefiori, D. C.; Baden, L. R.; Miller, J. M.; Das, R.\nScore: 3369.2, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23293434\nBackgroundSubvariants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) omicron XBB-lineage have the potential to escape immunity provided by prior infection or vaccination. For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs) vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented. ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were numerically higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86 that were similar to those against XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines. ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1) as well as the recently emerged BA.2.86 variant. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results overall indicate that the XBB.1.5-containing mRNA-1273.815 vaccine has the potential to provide protection against these emerging variants and support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.\nQuantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing over the course of COVID-19 infection\nAuthors: Lane, G.; Zhou, G.; Hultquist, J. F.; Simons, L. M.; Lorenzo-Redondo, R.; Ozer, E. A.; McCarthy, D. M.; Ison, M. G.; Achenbach, C. J.; Wang, X.; Wai, C. M.; Wyatt, E.; Aalsburg, A.; Yang, Q.; Noto, T.; Alisoltani, A.; Ysselstein, D.; Awatramani, R.; Murphy, R.; Theron, G.; Zelano, C.\nScore: 627.1, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138\nSARS-CoV-2 is spread through exhaled breath of infected individuals. A fundamental question in understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is how much virus an individual is exhaling into the environment while they breathe, over the course of their infection. Research on viral load dynamics during COVID-19 infection has focused on internal swab specimens, which provide a measure of viral loads inside the respiratory tract, but not on breath. Therefore, the dynamics of viral shedding on exhaled breath over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we collected exhaled breath specimens from COVID-19 patients and used RTq-PCR to show that numbers of exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies during COVID-19 infection do not decrease significantly until day 8 from symptom-onset. COVID-19-positive participants exhaled an average of 80 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copies per minute during the first 8 days of infection, with significant variability both between and within individuals, including spikes over 800 copies a minute in some patients. After day 8, there was a steep drop to levels nearing the limit of detection, persisting for up to 20 days. We further found that levels of exhaled viral RNA increased with self-rated symptom-severity, though individual variation was high. Levels of exhaled viral RNA did not differ across age, sex, time of day, vaccination status or viral variant. Our data provide a fine-grained, direct measure of the number of SARS-CoV-2 viral copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing--including 312 breath specimens collected multiple times daily over the course of infection--in order to fill an important gap in our understanding of the time course of exhaled viral loads in COVID-19.\nRisk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Those Up-to-Date and Not Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Vaccination by US CDC Criteria\nAuthors: Shrestha, N. K.; Burke, P. C.; Nowacki, A. S.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 5128.1, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackgroundThe CDC recently defined being \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\". MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time- dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and number of prior vaccine doses. ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, being \"up-to-date\" was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.05; 95% C.I., 0.88-1.25; P-value, 0.58). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination by the CDC definition do not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"not up-to-date\", bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination did not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those not \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.\nThe more symptoms the better? Covid-19 vaccine side effects and long-term neutralizing antibody response\nAuthors: Dutcher, E. G.; Epel, E. S.; Mason, A. E.; Hecht, F. M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low. This study explores the link between post-vaccination symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 363) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, with serum nAB concentration measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater changes in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels. Skin temperature had a stronger predictive relationship for 6-month than 1-month nAB level. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nPre-dominance of dengue non-cross-reacting SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies during the Omicron era and their role in the ADE-mediated surge of Dengue virus serotype 3\nAuthors: Sarker, S.; Dutta, C.; Mallick, A.; Das, S.; Das Chowdhury, C.; De, A.; Gorai, S.; Biswas, S.\nScore: 41.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295136\nIn India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave (2020-21) gradually faded away with the advent of the Omicron variants (2021-present). Dengue incidences were observably less in Southeast Asia during the active years of the pandemic (2020-21). However, Dengue virus type 3 (DV3) cases were increasingly reported in India and many other dengue-endemic countries concurrent with the progression of the Omicron wave since 2022. This observation prompted us to investigate the current state of cross-reactivity between prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and different DV serotypes. Fifty-five COVID-19 serum samples (collected between January-September, 2022) and three pre-pandemic healthy serum samples were tested for DV or SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) using the lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab)-positive samples were further tested for their ability to cross-neutralize DV types 1-4 (DV1-4) in Huh7 cell lines. Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DV diminished with the shift from Delta to Omicron prevalence. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV cross-reactive neutralized all DV serotypes, including DV3. However, Omicron wave serum samples were predominantly DV non-cross-reactive (about 70%) in LFIAs and coincided with the prevalence of BA.2 Omicron variant. They also cross-neutralized DV1, 2 and 4 but enhanced DV3 infectivity as evident from increased DV3 titres in virus neutralization test (VNT) compared to control serum samples. In conclusion, DV non-cross-reactive COVID-19 serum samples are becoming increasingly prominent in the present times. These non-cross-reactive serums could neutralize DV1, 2 and 4 but they are contributing to the surge in DV3 cases worldwide by means of ADE.\nComparative performance of COVID-19 test methods in healthcare workers during the omicron wave\nAuthors: Tornberg, E. C.; Tomlinson, A.; Oshiro, N. T. T.; Derfalie, E.; Curlin, M.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296099\nIntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents unique requirements for accessible, reliable testing, and many testing platforms and sampling techniques have been developed. However, not all test methods have been systematically compared to each other or a common gold standard, and the performance of tests developed in the early epidemic have not been consistently re-evaluated in the context of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. MethodsWe conducted a repeated measures study with adult healthcare workers presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants were tested using seven test modalities: PCR with samples from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and saliva; and BinaxNOW and iHealth antigen-based rapid detection tests (AgRDT) sampling the oropharynx and the nares. Test sensitivity was compared using any positive PCR test as the gold standard. Results325 individuals participated in the study. PCR tests were the most sensitive with saliva PCR at 0.957 {+/-} 0.048, nasopharyngeal PCR at 0.877 {+/-} 0.075, and oropharyngeal PCR at 0.849 {+/-} 0.082. Standard nasal rapid antigen tests were less sensitive but roughly equivalent at 0.613 {+/-} 0.110 for BinaxNOW brand and 0.627 {+/-} 0.109 for iHealth. Oropharyngeal rapid antigen tests were the least sensitive with BinaxNOW and iHealth brands at 0.400 {+/-} 0.111 and 0.311 {+/-} 0.105 respectively. ConclusionPCR remains the most sensitive testing modality for COVID-19, with saliva PCR being significantly more sensitive than oropharyngeal PCR and equivalent to nasopharyngeal PCR. Saliva testing has patient comfort and financial benefits, making it a preferred testing modality. Nasal AgRDTs are less sensitive than PCR though more accessible and convenient.\nPositive selection underlies repeated knockout of ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 evolution\nAuthors: Wagner, C.; Kistler, K. E.; Perchetti, G. A.; Baker, N.; Frisbie, L. A.; Torres, L. M.; Aragona, F.; Yun, C.; Figgins, M.; Greninger, A. L.; Cox, A.; Oltean, H. N.; Roychoudhury, P.; Bedford, T. D.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295927\nKnockout of the ORF8 protein has repeatedly spread through the global viral population during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here we use both regional and global pathogen sequencing to explore the selection pressures underlying its loss. In Washington State, we identified transmission clusters with ORF8 knockout throughout SARS-CoV-2 evolution, not just on novel, high fitness viral backbones. Indeed, ORF8 is truncated more frequently and knockouts circulate for longer than for any other gene. Using a global phylogeny, we find evidence of positive selection to explain this phenomenon: nonsense mutations resulting in shortened protein products occur more frequently and are associated with faster clade growth rates than synonymous mutations in ORF8. Loss of ORF8 is also associated with reduced clinical severity, highlighting the diverse clinical impacts of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.\nLongitudinal analysis within one hospital in sub-Saharan Africa over 20 years reveals repeated replacements of dominant clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae and stresses the importance to include temporal patterns for vaccine design considerations\nAuthors: Heinz, E.; Pearse, O.; Zuza, A.; Bilima, S.; Msefula, C.; Musicha, P.; Siyabu, P.; Tewesa, E.; Graf, F. E.; Lester, R.; Lissauer, S.; Cornick, J.; Lewis, J. M.; Kawaza, K.; Thomson, N. R.; Feasey, N. A.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296137\nInfections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria present a severe threat to global public health. The WHO defines drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae as a priority pathogen for which alternative treatments are needed given the limited treatment options and the rapid acquisition of novel resistance mechanisms by this species. Longitudinal descriptions of genomic epidemiology of Klebsiella pneumoniae can inform management strategies but data from sub-Saharan Africa are lacking. We present a longitudinal analysis of all invasive K. pneumoniae isolates from a single hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, southern Africa, from 1998-2020, combining clinical data with genome sequence analysis of the isolates. We show that after a dramatic increase in the number of infections from 2016 K. pneumoniae becomes hyperendemic, driven by an increase in neonatal infections. Genomic data show repeated waves of clonal expansion of different, often ward-restricted, lineages, suggestive of hospital associated transmission. We describe temporal trends in resistance and surface antigens, of relevance for vaccine development. Our data highlight a clear need for new interventions to prevent rather than treat K. pneumoniae infections in our setting. Whilst one option may be a vaccine, the majority of cases could be avoided by an increased focus on and investment in infection prevention and control measures, which would reduce all healthcare associated infections and not just one.\nPrevalence of COVID-19 and long COVID - Results from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 50 states.\nAuthors: Adams, M. L.; Grandpre, J.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296352\nRecent MMWR results estimate long COVID prevalence at 6.0% in June 2023, while the percentage of those with COVID reporting long COVID was 11.0%. The 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System addressed COVID (positive test) and long COVID (symptoms lasting [\u0026ge;]3 months) in a population-based sample from each state and DC. Results for 385,617 adults indicated 34.4% had ever had COVID, 21.9% of whom reported long COVID, representing 7.4% of all adults. State rates ranged from 25.4% - 40.8% for COVID and 4.1%- 11.1% for long COVID. Groups with high rates for both included women, younger adults, those with children in the household, plus those reporting obesity, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Highest adjusted odds ratios for COVID were 2.34 (95% CI 2.20-2.49) for age 18-24 years vs. age 65+ while for long COVID it was 2.81 (2.53-3.13) for 3+ of the 5 conditions. Most frequently reported problems for those with long COVID were fatigue (26.0%), shortness of breath (18.8%), loss of taste or smell (17.2%), and memory problems (9.9%). Results show the need for state-based data and suggest a focus on younger adults is needed to address COVID and long COVID.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objective Vaccination reduces the risk of acute COVID-19 in children, but it is less clear whether it protects against long COVID. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against long COVID in children aged 5 to 17 years. Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from 17 health systems in the RECOVER PCORnet electronic health record (EHR) Program for visits between vaccine availability, and October 29, 2022. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate VE against long COVID with matching on age group (5 to 11, 12 to 17) and time period and adjustment for sex, ethnicity, health system, comorbidity burden, and pre-exposure health care utilization. We examined both probable (symptom-based) and diagnosed long COVID in the year following vaccination. Results The vaccination rate was 56% in the cohort of 1,037,936 children. The incidence of probably long COVID was 4.5% among patients with COVID-19, while diagnosed long COVID was 0.7%. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness within 12 months was 35.4% (95 CI 24.5 - 44.5) against probable long COVID and 41.7% (15.0- 60.0) against diagnosed long COVID. VE was higher for adolescents 50.3% [36.3 - 61.0]) than children aged 5-11 (23.8% [4.9 -39.0]). VE was higher at 6 months (61.4% [51.0 - 69.6]), but decreased to 10.6% (-26.8 - 37.0%) at 18 months. Discussion This large retrospective study shows a moderate protective effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against long COVID. The effect is stronger in adolescents, who have higher risk of long COVID, and wanes over time. Understanding VE mechanism against long COVID requires more study, including EHR sources and prospective data.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSubvariants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) omicron XBB-lineage have the potential to escape immunity provided by prior infection or vaccination. For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs) vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented.

ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were numerically higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86 that were similar to those against XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines.

ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1) as well as the recently emerged BA.2.86 variant. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results overall indicate that the XBB.1.5-containing mRNA-1273.815 vaccine has the potential to provide protection against these emerging variants and support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 is spread through exhaled breath of infected individuals. A fundamental question in understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is how much virus an individual is exhaling into the environment while they breathe, over the course of their infection. Research on viral load dynamics during COVID-19 infection has focused on internal swab specimens, which provide a measure of viral loads inside the respiratory tract, but not on breath. Therefore, the dynamics of viral shedding on exhaled breath over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we collected exhaled breath specimens from COVID-19 patients and used RTq-PCR to show that numbers of exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies during COVID-19 infection do not decrease significantly until day 8 from symptom-onset. COVID-19-positive participants exhaled an average of 80 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copies per minute during the first 8 days of infection, with significant variability both between and within individuals, including spikes over 800 copies a minute in some patients. After day 8, there was a steep drop to levels nearing the limit of detection, persisting for up to 20 days. We further found that levels of exhaled viral RNA increased with self-rated symptom-severity, though individual variation was high. Levels of exhaled viral RNA did not differ across age, sex, time of day, vaccination status or viral variant. Our data provide a fine-grained, direct measure of the number of SARS-CoV-2 viral copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing--including 312 breath specimens collected multiple times daily over the course of infection--in order to fill an important gap in our understanding of the time course of exhaled viral loads in COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CDC recently defined being &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34;.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time- dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#34;not up-to-date&#34; than the &#34;up-to-date&#34; state. On multivariable analysis, being &#34;up-to-date&#34; was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.05; 95% C.I., 0.88-1.25; P-value, 0.58). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#34;up-to-date&#34; after 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine.

ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination by the CDC definition do not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;not up-to-date&#34;, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.

SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination did not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those not &#34;up-to-date&#34;. The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low. This study explores the link between post-vaccination symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 363) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, with serum nAB concentration measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater changes in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels. Skin temperature had a stronger predictive relationship for 6-month than 1-month nAB level. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave (2020-21) gradually faded away with the advent of the Omicron variants (2021-present). Dengue incidences were observably less in Southeast Asia during the active years of the pandemic (2020-21). However, Dengue virus type 3 (DV3) cases were increasingly reported in India and many other dengue-endemic countries concurrent with the progression of the Omicron wave since 2022. This observation prompted us to investigate the current state of cross-reactivity between prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and different DV serotypes.

Fifty-five COVID-19 serum samples (collected between January-September, 2022) and three pre-pandemic healthy serum samples were tested for DV or SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) using the lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab)-positive samples were further tested for their ability to cross-neutralize DV types 1-4 (DV1-4) in Huh7 cell lines.

Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DV diminished with the shift from Delta to Omicron prevalence. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV cross-reactive neutralized all DV serotypes, including DV3. However, Omicron wave serum samples were predominantly DV non-cross-reactive (about 70%) in LFIAs and coincided with the prevalence of BA.2 Omicron variant. They also cross-neutralized DV1, 2 and 4 but enhanced DV3 infectivity as evident from increased DV3 titres in virus neutralization test (VNT) compared to control serum samples.

In conclusion, DV non-cross-reactive COVID-19 serum samples are becoming increasingly prominent in the present times. These non-cross-reactive serums could neutralize DV1, 2 and 4 but they are contributing to the surge in DV3 cases worldwide by means of ADE.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents unique requirements for accessible, reliable testing, and many testing platforms and sampling techniques have been developed. However, not all test methods have been systematically compared to each other or a common gold standard, and the performance of tests developed in the early epidemic have not been consistently re-evaluated in the context of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

MethodsWe conducted a repeated measures study with adult healthcare workers presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants were tested using seven test modalities: PCR with samples from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and saliva; and BinaxNOW and iHealth antigen-based rapid detection tests (AgRDT) sampling the oropharynx and the nares. Test sensitivity was compared using any positive PCR test as the gold standard.

Results325 individuals participated in the study. PCR tests were the most sensitive with saliva PCR at 0.957 {&#43;/-} 0.048, nasopharyngeal PCR at 0.877 {&#43;/-} 0.075, and oropharyngeal PCR at 0.849 {&#43;/-} 0.082. Standard nasal rapid antigen tests were less sensitive but roughly equivalent at 0.613 {&#43;/-} 0.110 for BinaxNOW brand and 0.627 {&#43;/-} 0.109 for iHealth. Oropharyngeal rapid antigen tests were the least sensitive with BinaxNOW and iHealth brands at 0.400 {&#43;/-} 0.111 and 0.311 {&#43;/-} 0.105 respectively.

ConclusionPCR remains the most sensitive testing modality for COVID-19, with saliva PCR being significantly more sensitive than oropharyngeal PCR and equivalent to nasopharyngeal PCR. Saliva testing has patient comfort and financial benefits, making it a preferred testing modality. Nasal AgRDTs are less sensitive than PCR though more accessible and convenient.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Knockout of the ORF8 protein has repeatedly spread through the global viral population during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here we use both regional and global pathogen sequencing to explore the selection pressures underlying its loss. In Washington State, we identified transmission clusters with ORF8 knockout throughout SARS-CoV-2 evolution, not just on novel, high fitness viral backbones. Indeed, ORF8 is truncated more frequently and knockouts circulate for longer than for any other gene. Using a global phylogeny, we find evidence of positive selection to explain this phenomenon: nonsense mutations resulting in shortened protein products occur more frequently and are associated with faster clade growth rates than synonymous mutations in ORF8. Loss of ORF8 is also associated with reduced clinical severity, highlighting the diverse clinical impacts of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria present a severe threat to global public health. The WHO defines drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae as a priority pathogen for which alternative treatments are needed given the limited treatment options and the rapid acquisition of novel resistance mechanisms by this species. Longitudinal descriptions of genomic epidemiology of Klebsiella pneumoniae can inform management strategies but data from sub-Saharan Africa are lacking.

We present a longitudinal analysis of all invasive K. pneumoniae isolates from a single hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, southern Africa, from 1998-2020, combining clinical data with genome sequence analysis of the isolates. We show that after a dramatic increase in the number of infections from 2016 K. pneumoniae becomes hyperendemic, driven by an increase in neonatal infections. Genomic data show repeated waves of clonal expansion of different, often ward-restricted, lineages, suggestive of hospital associated transmission. We describe temporal trends in resistance and surface antigens, of relevance for vaccine development.

Our data highlight a clear need for new interventions to prevent rather than treat K. pneumoniae infections in our setting. Whilst one option may be a vaccine, the majority of cases could be avoided by an increased focus on and investment in infection prevention and control measures, which would reduce all healthcare associated infections and not just one.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent MMWR results estimate long COVID prevalence at 6.0% in June 2023, while the percentage of those with COVID reporting long COVID was 11.0%. The 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System addressed COVID (positive test) and long COVID (symptoms lasting [&amp;ge;]3 months) in a population-based sample from each state and DC. Results for 385,617 adults indicated 34.4% had ever had COVID, 21.9% of whom reported long COVID, representing 7.4% of all adults. State rates ranged from 25.4% - 40.8% for COVID and 4.1%- 11.1% for long COVID. Groups with high rates for both included women, younger adults, those with children in the household, plus those reporting obesity, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Highest adjusted odds ratios for COVID were 2.34 (95% CI 2.20-2.49) for age 18-24 years vs. age 65&#43; while for long COVID it was 2.81 (2.53-3.13) for 3&#43; of the 5 conditions. Most frequently reported problems for those with long COVID were fatigue (26.0%), shortness of breath (18.8%), loss of taste or smell (17.2%), and memory problems (9.9%). Results show the need for state-based data and suggest a focus on younger adults is needed to address COVID and long COVID.</p>
