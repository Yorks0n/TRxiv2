M.\nScore: 323.2, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301374\nRepeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.\nBlood transcriptomics reveal persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA and candidate biomarkers in Long COVID patients\nAuthors: MENEZES, S. M.; JAMOULLE, M.; Carletto, M. P.; Van Holm, B.; Moens, L.; Meyts, I.; Maes, P.; Van Weyenbergh, J.\nScore: 331.4, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301293\nWith an estimated 65 million individuals suffering from Long COVID, validated therapeutic strategies as well as non-invasive biomarkers are direly needed to guide clinical management. We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.\nRoutes of importation and spatial dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants during localised interventions in Chile\nAuthors: Gutierrez, B.; Tsui, J. L.- H.; Pullano, G.; Mazzoli, M.; Gangavarapu, K.; Inward, R.; Bajaj, S.; Evans Pena, R.; Busch Moreno, S.; Suchard, M. A.; Pybus, O. G.; Dunner, A.; Puentes, R.; Ayala, S.; Fernandez, J.; Araos, R.; Ferres, L.; Colizza, V.; Kraemer, M. U. G.\nScore: 48.0, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301504\nSouth America suffered large SARS-CoV-2 epidemics between 2020 and 2022 caused by multiple variants of interest and concern, some causing substantial morbidity and mortality. However, their transmission dynamics are poorly characterised. The epidemic situation in Chile enables us to investigate differences in the distribution and spread of variants Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Delta. Chile implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and an integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance system that included airport and community surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we combine viral genomic data and anonymised human mobility data from mobile phones to characterise the routes of importation of different variants into Chile, the relative contributions of airport-based importations to viral diversity versus land border crossings and test the impact of the mobility network on the diffusion of viral lineages within the country. We find that Alpha, Lambda and Mu were identified in Chile via airport surveillance six, four and five weeks ahead of their detection via community surveillance, respectively. Further, some variants that originated in South America were imported into Chile via land rather than international air travel, most notably Gamma. Different variants exhibited similar trends of viral dissemination throughout the country following their importation, and we show that the mobility network predicts the time of arrival of imported lineages to different Chilean comunas. Higher stringency of local NPIs was also associated with fewer domestic viral importations. Our results show how genomic surveillance combined with high resolution mobility data can help predict the multi-scale geographic expansion of emerging infectious diseases. Significance statementGlobal preparedness for pandemic threats requires an understanding of the global variations of spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. Regional differences are important because the local context sets the conditions for the unfolding of local epidemics, which in turn affect transmission dynamics at a broader scale. Knowledge gaps from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remain for regions like South America, where distinct sets of viral variants emerged and spread from late 2020 onwards, and where changes in human behaviour resulted in epidemics which differed from those observed in other regions. Our interdisciplinary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Chile provides insights into the spatiotemporal trends of viral diffusion in the region which shed light on the drivers that can influence future epidemic waves and pandemics.\nMonitoring Report: Respiratory Viruses - December 2023 Data\nAuthors: Gratzl, S.; Cartwright, B. M. G.; Rodriguez, P. J.; Baker, C.; Stucky, N.\nScore: 42.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301528\nBackgroundFew sources regularly monitor hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses. This study provides current hospitalization trends associated with six common respiratory viruses: COVID-19, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. ObjectiveThis study aims to supplement the surveillance data provided by the CDC by describing trends overall and for each respiratory virus. This study also provides valuable insight into two at-risk populations: infants and children (age 0-4) and older adults (age 65 and over). MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the USA consortium of US healthcare systems, we identified people who were hospitalized between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. We identified people who tested positive for any of the six respiratory virus within 14 days of the hospitalization. We report weekly trends in the rate of hospitalizations associated with each virus per all hospitalizations for the overall population and the two high-risk sub populations, infants and children and older adults. ResultsWe included 502,484 hospitalizations of 471,401 unique patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. Overall, the rate of hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses continue to increase through the end of December 2023 (92.8% increase since November 2023). The largest increases over the past month have been seen in influenza- (251.7% increase), HMPV- (115.0% increase), and COVID-associated (88.6% increase) hospitalizations. For infants and children, RSV accounted for the most respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations, despite decreases throughout December 2023. In this population, COVID-associated hospitalizations had the biggest increase in the last month. For the older adult population, respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations increased to 10.3% per all hospitalizations. COVID remained the largest contributor; 5.3% of all hospitalizations were associated with COVID in the older adult population. DiscussionRespiratory virus-associated hospitalizations continued to increase overall, including for the two high risk populations we studied. RSV-associated hospitalizations continue to be the main contributor to illness in infants and children, while COVID-associated hospitalizations are the largest contributor for the older adult population. We will continue to monitor trends in all respiratory viruses.

Specifically, COVID- (88.6%), influenza- (251.7%), and HMPV- (115.0%) associated hospitalization trends increased. COVID and influenza-associated hospitalizations are at 3.3% and 3.0% of all hospitalizations, respectively. Other viruses are each below 1% of hospitalizations. Nevertheless, at the end of December 2023, respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations accounted for 7.7% of all hospitalizations.

COVID-associated hospitalizations continue to make up the largest percentage of hospitalizations in this age group (5.3% in December).\nPredicting COVID-19 cases across a large university campus using complementary built environment and wastewater surveillance approaches\nAuthors: Hinz, A.; Moggridge, J. A.; Ke, H.; Hicks, A. M. A.; Doukhanine, E.; Fralick, M.; Hug, L.; MacFadden, D.; Mejbel, H.; Nott, C.; Raudanskis, A.; Thampi, N.; Wong, A.; Kassen, R.\nScore: 34.7, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.23300025\nBackgroundEnvironmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater has become an invaluable tool for population-level surveillance. Built environment sampling may provide complementary spatially-refined detection for viral surveillance in congregate settings such as universities. MethodsWe conducted a prospective environmental surveillance study at the University of Ottawa between September 2021 and April 2022. Floor surface samples were collected twice weekly from six university buildings. Samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. A Poisson regression was used to model the campus-wide COVID-19 cases predicted from the fraction of floor swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, building CO2 levels, Wi-Fi usage, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in regional wastewater. We used a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis to model building-level cases using viral copies detected in floor samples as a predictor. A random intercepts logistic regression model tested whether floor samples collected in high-traffic areas were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 present than low-traffic areas. ResultsOver the 32-week study period, we collected 554 floor swabs at six university buildings. Overall, 13% of swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2, with positivity ranging between 4.8% and 32.7% among university buildings. Both floor swab positivity (Spearman r = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-0.87) and regional wastewater signal (Spearman r = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.18-0.73) were positively correlated with on-campus COVID-19 cases. In addition, built environment detection was a predictor of cases linked to individual university buildings (IRlog10(copies) + 1 = 17, 95% CI: 7-44). There was no significant difference in detection between floors sampled in high-traffic versus low-traffic areas (OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.8-2.1). ConclusionsDetection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on floors and viral RNA levels found in wastewater were strongly associated with the incidence of COVID-19 cases on a university campus. These data suggest a potential role for institutional built environment sampling, used together with wastewater surveillance, for predicting COVID-19 cases at both campus-wide and building level scales.\nPossible roles of phytochemicals with bioactive properties in the prevention of and recovery from COVID-19\nAuthors: Koyama, S.; Shields, V.

V.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301882\nPurpose There have been large geographical differences in the infection and death rates of COVID-19. Foods and beverages containing high amounts of phytochemicals with bioactive properties were suggested to prevent contracting, to limit the severity of, and to facilitate recovery from COVID-19. The goal of our study was to determine the correlation of the type of foods/beverages people consumed and the risk reduction of contracting COVID-19 and the recovery from COVID-19. Methods We developed an online survey that asked the participants whether they contracted COVID-19, their symptoms, time to recover, and their frequency of eating various types of foods/beverages. The survey was first developed in English and then translated into 10 different languages. Results The participants who did not contract COVID-19 consumed vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages significantly more than the participants who contracted COVID-19 and those who were not tested but became sick most likely from COVID-19. The geographic location of participants corresponded with the language of the survey, except for the English version, thus, nine out of the 10 language versions represented a country. Among the six countries (India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain) with over one hundred participants, we found that in India and Japan the people who contracted COVID-19 showed significantly shorter recovery time, and greater daily intake of vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages was associated with faster recovery. Conclusion Our results suggest that phytochemical compounds included in the vegetables may have contributed in not only preventing contraction of COVID-19, but also accelerating their recovery.\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the first year after hematopoietic cell transplant or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy: A prospective, multicenter, observational study (BMT CTN 2101)\nAuthors: Hill, J.

ObjectiveTo describe humoral and cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination initiated \u003c4 months versus 4-12 months after cellular therapy. DesignMulticenter prospective observational study. Setting34 centers in the United States. Participants466 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT; n=231), autologous HCT (n=170), or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy (n=65) recipients enrolled between April 2021 and June 2022. InterventionsSARS-CoV-2 vaccination as part of routine care. MeasurementsWe obtained blood prior to and after vaccinations at up to five time points and tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike (anti-S) IgG in all participants and neutralizing antibodies for Wuhan D614G, Delta B.1.617.2, and Omicron B.1.1.529 strains, as well as SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell receptors (TCRs), in a subgroup. ResultsAnti-S IgG and neutralizing antibody responses increased with vaccination in HCT recipients irrespective of vaccine initiation timing but were unchanged in CAR-T cell recipients initiating vaccines within 4 months. Anti-S IgG [\u0026ge;]2,500 U/mL was correlated with high neutralizing antibody titers and attained by the last time point in 70%, 69%, and 34% of allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and CAR-T cell recipients, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were attained in 57%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. Humoral and cellular responses did not significantly differ among participants initiating vaccinations \u003c4 months vs 4-12 months after cellular therapy. Pre-cellular therapy SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination were key predictors of post-cellular therapy anti-S IgG levels. LimitationsThe majority of participants were adults and received mRNA vaccines. ConclusionsThese data support starting mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination three to four months after allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and CAR-T cell therapy.

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is among the strongest risk factors for mortality from COVID-19, however, therapeutic options have been lacking in this patient population given exclusion of ESKD in the registrational trials of antiviral therapy leading to limited FDA approval. In our retrospective study of patients with ESKD on dialysis admitted for symptomatic COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2020, we found that majority of patients (\u003e80%) were admitted to the hospital early during their disease course (within 5 days of symptom onset). Despite this pattern of early admission, there was a high risk of respiratory failure within 90 days since admission (30%) among this population. We argue that this unique pattern of early presentation and high risk of progression to respiratory failure of the ESKD patients suggests an opportunity for further research to determine if outpatient antiviral therapies should be expanded to patients with ESKD to address the huge unmet need of therapeutic intervention in this vulnerable population.\nXenomonitoring of Lymphatic filariasis and risk factors for transmission on the Kenyan coast\nAuthors: Bartilol, B.; Adipo, L. B.; Garama, K.; Karisa, J.; Kamau, A.; Mwandawiro, C.; Wanjiku, C.; Mbogo, C.; Maia, M.; Mwangangi, J.; Rono, M.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.24301642\nLymphatic filariasis (LF) is an infectious neglected tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne nematode and is a major cause of disability. In 2022, it was estimated that 51 million people were infected with LF. In Kenya filariasis is endemic along the entire coastal strip. The main vectors are Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae in rural areas and Culex quinquefaciatus mosquitoes in urban areas. In 2022, mosquitoes were collected from Kilifi, Kwale and Taita-Taveta counties which are located within the LF endemic region in Kenya. Subsequently, genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was then extracted from these mosquitoes for speciation and analysis of W. bancrofti infection rates. The impact of socio-demographic and household attributes on infection rates were assessed using generalized estimating equations. A total of 18,121 mosquitoes belonging to Culex (n = 11,414) and Anopheles (n = 6,707) genera were collected. Morphological identification revealed that Anopheline mosquito were dominated by An. funestus (n = 3,045) and An. gambiae (n = 2,873). Wuchereria bancrofti infection rates were highest in Kilifi (35.4%; 95% CI 28%-43.3%, n = 57/161) and lowest in Taita Taveta (5.3%; 95% CI 3.3%-8.0%, n = 22/412). The major vectors incriminated are An. rivulorum, An. funestus sensu stricto and An. arabiensis. The risk of W. bancrofti infection was significantly higher in An. funestus complex (OR = 18.0; 95% CI 1.80-180; p = 0.014) compared to An. gambiae (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 0.16-15.10; p = 0.7). Additionally, higher risk was observed in outdoor resting mosquitoes (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.06-2.78; p = 0.027) and in homesteads that owned livestock (OR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.11-3.73; p = 0.021). Bednet (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.12-1.32; p = 0.13) and poultry ownership (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.30-0.89, p = 0.018) seems to provide protection. Anopheles funestus complex emerged as the primary vectors of lymphatic filariasis along the Kenyan coast. These findings also highlight that a significant portion of disease transmission potentially occurs outdoors. Therefore, control measures targeting outdoor resting mosquitoes such as zooprophylaxis, larval source management and attractive sugar baits may have potential for LF transmission reduction. Author summaryLymphatic filariasis (LF) in the African continent is mainly caused by a mosquito-borne nematode: Wuchereria bancrofti. In urban areas transmission is mainly by Culex quinquefaciatus whereas in rural areas it is dominated by Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We investigated the vectorial systems for LF in rural coastal Kenya and factors associated with the risk of diseases transmission in the region. We identified An. funestus sensu lato sibling species An. rivulorum and An. funestus sensu stricto as the dominant vectors of lymphatic filariasis along the Kenyan coast. We also show that a higher proportion of transmission is likely to take place outdoors necessitating the implementation of vector control strategies that target exophilic mosquitoes such as zooprophylaxis and larval source management. Factors associated with transmission of LF include ownership of livestock and houses made of natural materials such as thatched roof and mud walls. Bednet and poulty ownership were associated with protection. We also highlight the importance of molecular xenomonitoring in the surveillance of lymphatic filariasis, because of its non-invasive nature and potential for incriminating new vectors of lymphatic filariasis.\nDODGE: Automated point source bacterial outbreak detection using cumulative long term genomic surveillance.\nAuthors: Payne, M.; Hu, D.; Wang, Q.; Sullivan, G.; Graham, R. M.; Rathnayake, I. U.; Jennison, A.; Sintchenko, V.; Lan, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301506\nSummaryThe reliable and timely recognition of outbreaks is a key component of public health surveillance for foodborne diseases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers high resolution typing of foodborne bacterial pathogens and facilitates the accurate detection of outbreaks. This detection relies on grouping WGS data into clusters at an appropriate genetic threshold, however, methods and tools for selecting and adjusting such thresholds according to the required resolution of surveillance and epidemiological context are lacking. Here we present DODGE (Dynamic Outbreak Detection for Genomic Epidemiology), an algorithm to dynamically select and compare these genetic thresholds. DODGE can analyse expanding datasets over time and clusters that are predicted to correspond to outbreaks (or investigation clusters) can be named with the established genomic nomenclature systems to facilitate integrated analysis across jurisdictions. DODGE was tested in two real-world genomic surveillance datasets of different duration, two months from Australia and nine years from the UK. In both cases only a minority of isolates were identified as investigation clusters. Two known outbreaks in the UK dataset were detected by DODGE and were recognised at an earlier timepoint than the outbreaks were reported. These findings demonstrated the potential of the DODGE approach to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of genomic surveillance for foodborne diseases and the effectiveness of the algorithm developed. Availability and implementationDODGE is freely available at https://github.com/LanLab/dodge and can easily be installed using Conda.

        <p class="abstract">Repeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With an estimated 65 million individuals suffering from Long COVID, validated therapeutic strategies as well as non-invasive biomarkers are direly needed to guide clinical management. We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">South America suffered large SARS-CoV-2 epidemics between 2020 and 2022 caused by multiple variants of interest and concern, some causing substantial morbidity and mortality. However, their transmission dynamics are poorly characterised. The epidemic situation in Chile enables us to investigate differences in the distribution and spread of variants Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Delta. Chile implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and an integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance system that included airport and community surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we combine viral genomic data and anonymised human mobility data from mobile phones to characterise the routes of importation of different variants into Chile, the relative contributions of airport-based importations to viral diversity versus land border crossings and test the impact of the mobility network on the diffusion of viral lineages within the country. We find that Alpha, Lambda and Mu were identified in Chile via airport surveillance six, four and five weeks ahead of their detection via community surveillance, respectively. Further, some variants that originated in South America were imported into Chile via land rather than international air travel, most notably Gamma. Different variants exhibited similar trends of viral dissemination throughout the country following their importation, and we show that the mobility network predicts the time of arrival of imported lineages to different Chilean comunas. Higher stringency of local NPIs was also associated with fewer domestic viral importations. Our results show how genomic surveillance combined with high resolution mobility data can help predict the multi-scale geographic expansion of emerging infectious diseases.

Significance statementGlobal preparedness for pandemic threats requires an understanding of the global variations of spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. Regional differences are important because the local context sets the conditions for the unfolding of local epidemics, which in turn affect transmission dynamics at a broader scale. Knowledge gaps from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remain for regions like South America, where distinct sets of viral variants emerged and spread from late 2020 onwards, and where changes in human behaviour resulted in epidemics which differed from those observed in other regions. Our interdisciplinary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Chile provides insights into the spatiotemporal trends of viral diffusion in the region which shed light on the drivers that can influence future epidemic waves and pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFew sources regularly monitor hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses. This study provides current hospitalization trends associated with six common respiratory viruses: COVID-19, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus.

ObjectiveThis study aims to supplement the surveillance data provided by the CDC by describing trends overall and for each respiratory virus. This study also provides valuable insight into two at-risk populations: infants and children (age 0-4) and older adults (age 65 and over).

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the USA consortium of US healthcare systems, we identified people who were hospitalized between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. We identified people who tested positive for any of the six respiratory virus within 14 days of the hospitalization. We report weekly trends in the rate of hospitalizations associated with each virus per all hospitalizations for the overall population and the two high-risk sub populations, infants and children and older adults.

ResultsWe included 502,484 hospitalizations of 471,401 unique patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023.

Overall, the rate of hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses continue to increase through the end of December 2023 (92.8% increase since November 2023). The largest increases over the past month have been seen in influenza- (251.7% increase), HMPV- (115.0% increase), and COVID-associated (88.6% increase) hospitalizations. For infants and children, RSV accounted for the most respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations, despite decreases throughout December 2023. In this population, COVID-associated hospitalizations had the biggest increase in the last month. For the older adult population, respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations increased to 10.3% per all hospitalizations. COVID remained the largest contributor; 5.3% of all hospitalizations were associated with COVID in the older adult population.

DiscussionRespiratory virus-associated hospitalizations continued to increase overall, including for the two high risk populations we studied. RSV-associated hospitalizations continue to be the main contributor to illness in infants and children, while COVID-associated hospitalizations are the largest contributor for the older adult population. We will continue to monitor trends in all respiratory viruses.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEnvironmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater has become an invaluable tool for population-level surveillance. Built environment sampling may provide complementary spatially-refined detection for viral surveillance in congregate settings such as universities.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective environmental surveillance study at the University of Ottawa between September 2021 and April 2022. Floor surface samples were collected twice weekly from six university buildings. Samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. A Poisson regression was used to model the campus-wide COVID-19 cases predicted from the fraction of floor swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, building CO2 levels, Wi-Fi usage, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in regional wastewater. We used a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis to model building-level cases using viral copies detected in floor samples as a predictor. A random intercepts logistic regression model tested whether floor samples collected in high-traffic areas were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 present than low-traffic areas.

ResultsOver the 32-week study period, we collected 554 floor swabs at six university buildings. Overall, 13% of swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2, with positivity ranging between 4.8% and 32.7% among university buildings. Both floor swab positivity (Spearman r = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-0.87) and regional wastewater signal (Spearman r = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.18-0.73) were positively correlated with on-campus COVID-19 cases. In addition, built environment detection was a predictor of cases linked to individual university buildings (IRlog10(copies) &#43; 1 = 17, 95% CI: 7-44). There was no significant difference in detection between floors sampled in high-traffic versus low-traffic areas (OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.8-2.1).

ConclusionsDetection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on floors and viral RNA levels found in wastewater were strongly associated with the incidence of COVID-19 cases on a university campus. These data suggest a potential role for institutional built environment sampling, used together with wastewater surveillance, for predicting COVID-19 cases at both campus-wide and building level scales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose There have been large geographical differences in the infection and death rates of COVID-19. Foods and beverages containing high amounts of phytochemicals with bioactive properties were suggested to prevent contracting, to limit the severity of, and to facilitate recovery from COVID-19. The goal of our study was to determine the correlation of the type of foods/beverages people consumed and the risk reduction of contracting COVID-19 and the recovery from COVID-19. Methods We developed an online survey that asked the participants whether they contracted COVID-19, their symptoms, time to recover, and their frequency of eating various types of foods/beverages. The survey was first developed in English and then translated into 10 different languages. Results The participants who did not contract COVID-19 consumed vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages significantly more than the participants who contracted COVID-19 and those who were not tested but became sick most likely from COVID-19. The geographic location of participants corresponded with the language of the survey, except for the English version, thus, nine out of the 10 language versions represented a country. Among the six countries (India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain) with over one hundred participants, we found that in India and Japan the people who contracted COVID-19 showed significantly shorter recovery time, and greater daily intake of vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages was associated with faster recovery. Conclusion Our results suggest that phytochemical compounds included in the vegetables may have contributed in not only preventing contraction of COVID-19, but also accelerating their recovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe optimal timing of vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines after cellular therapy is incompletely understood.

ObjectiveTo describe humoral and cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination initiated &lt;4 months versus 4-12 months after cellular therapy.

DesignMulticenter prospective observational study.

Setting34 centers in the United States.

Participants466 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT; n=231), autologous HCT (n=170), or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy (n=65) recipients enrolled between April 2021 and June 2022.

InterventionsSARS-CoV-2 vaccination as part of routine care.

MeasurementsWe obtained blood prior to and after vaccinations at up to five time points and tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike (anti-S) IgG in all participants and neutralizing antibodies for Wuhan D614G, Delta B.1.617.2, and Omicron B.1.1.529 strains, as well as SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell receptors (TCRs), in a subgroup.

ResultsAnti-S IgG and neutralizing antibody responses increased with vaccination in HCT recipients irrespective of vaccine initiation timing but were unchanged in CAR-T cell recipients initiating vaccines within 4 months. Anti-S IgG [&amp;ge;]2,500 U/mL was correlated with high neutralizing antibody titers and attained by the last time point in 70%, 69%, and 34% of allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and CAR-T cell recipients, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were attained in 57%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. Humoral and cellular responses did not significantly differ among participants initiating vaccinations &lt;4 months vs 4-12 months after cellular therapy. Pre-cellular therapy SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination were key predictors of post-cellular therapy anti-S IgG levels.

LimitationsThe majority of participants were adults and received mRNA vaccines.

ConclusionsThese data support starting mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination three to four months after allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and CAR-T cell therapy.

        <p class="abstract">Antiviral medications such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are most effective when used early in the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These medications are mainly authorized for outpatient use in high risk populations. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is among the strongest risk factors for mortality from COVID-19, however, therapeutic options have been lacking in this patient population given exclusion of ESKD in the registrational trials of antiviral therapy leading to limited FDA approval. In our retrospective study of patients with ESKD on dialysis admitted for symptomatic COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2020, we found that majority of patients (&gt;80%) were admitted to the hospital early during their disease course (within 5 days of symptom onset). Despite this pattern of early admission, there was a high risk of respiratory failure within 90 days since admission (30%) among this population. We argue that this unique pattern of early presentation and high risk of progression to respiratory failure of the ESKD patients suggests an opportunity for further research to determine if outpatient antiviral therapies should be expanded to patients with ESKD to address the huge unmet need of therapeutic intervention in this vulnerable population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is an infectious neglected tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne nematode and is a major cause of disability. In 2022, it was estimated that 51 million people were infected with LF. In Kenya filariasis is endemic along the entire coastal strip. The main vectors are Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae in rural areas and Culex quinquefaciatus mosquitoes in urban areas.

In 2022, mosquitoes were collected from Kilifi, Kwale and Taita-Taveta counties which are located within the LF endemic region in Kenya. Subsequently, genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was then extracted from these mosquitoes for speciation and analysis of W. bancrofti infection rates. The impact of socio-demographic and household attributes on infection rates were assessed using generalized estimating equations.

A total of 18,121 mosquitoes belonging to Culex (n = 11,414) and Anopheles (n = 6,707) genera were collected. Morphological identification revealed that Anopheline mosquito were dominated by An. funestus (n = 3,045) and An. gambiae (n = 2,873). Wuchereria bancrofti infection rates were highest in Kilifi (35.4%; 95% CI 28%-43.3%, n = 57/161) and lowest in Taita Taveta (5.3%; 95% CI 3.3%-8.0%, n = 22/412). The major vectors incriminated are An. rivulorum, An. funestus sensu stricto and An. arabiensis. The risk of W. bancrofti infection was significantly higher in An. funestus complex (OR = 18.0; 95% CI 1.80-180; p = 0.014) compared to An. gambiae (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 0.16-15.10; p = 0.7). Additionally, higher risk was observed in outdoor resting mosquitoes (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.06-2.78; p = 0.027) and in homesteads that owned livestock (OR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.11-3.73; p = 0.021). Bednet (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.12-1.32; p = 0.13) and poultry ownership (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.30-0.89, p = 0.018) seems to provide protection.

Anopheles funestus complex emerged as the primary vectors of lymphatic filariasis along the Kenyan coast. These findings also highlight that a significant portion of disease transmission potentially occurs outdoors. Therefore, control measures targeting outdoor resting mosquitoes such as zooprophylaxis, larval source management and attractive sugar baits may have potential for LF transmission reduction.

Author summaryLymphatic filariasis (LF) in the African continent is mainly caused by a mosquito-borne nematode: Wuchereria bancrofti. In urban areas transmission is mainly by Culex quinquefaciatus whereas in rural areas it is dominated by Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We investigated the vectorial systems for LF in rural coastal Kenya and factors associated with the risk of diseases transmission in the region. We identified An. funestus sensu lato sibling species An. rivulorum and An. funestus sensu stricto as the dominant vectors of lymphatic filariasis along the Kenyan coast. We also show that a higher proportion of transmission is likely to take place outdoors necessitating the implementation of vector control strategies that target exophilic mosquitoes such as zooprophylaxis and larval source management. Factors associated with transmission of LF include ownership of livestock and houses made of natural materials such as thatched roof and mud walls. Bednet and poulty ownership were associated with protection. We also highlight the importance of molecular xenomonitoring in the surveillance of lymphatic filariasis, because of its non-invasive nature and potential for incriminating new vectors of lymphatic filariasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SummaryThe reliable and timely recognition of outbreaks is a key component of public health surveillance for foodborne diseases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers high resolution typing of foodborne bacterial pathogens and facilitates the accurate detection of outbreaks. This detection relies on grouping WGS data into clusters at an appropriate genetic threshold, however, methods and tools for selecting and adjusting such thresholds according to the required resolution of surveillance and epidemiological context are lacking. Here we present DODGE (Dynamic Outbreak Detection for Genomic Epidemiology), an algorithm to dynamically select and compare these genetic thresholds. DODGE can analyse expanding datasets over time and clusters that are predicted to correspond to outbreaks (or  investigation clusters) can be named with the established genomic nomenclature systems to facilitate integrated analysis across jurisdictions. DODGE was tested in two real-world genomic surveillance datasets of different duration, two months from Australia and nine years from the UK. In both cases only a minority of isolates were identified as investigation clusters. Two known outbreaks in the UK dataset were detected by DODGE and were recognised at an earlier timepoint than the outbreaks were reported. These findings demonstrated the potential of the DODGE approach to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of genomic surveillance for foodborne diseases and the effectiveness of the algorithm developed.

These clusters are compared to existing investigation and non-investigation clusters from previous time periods (blue arrow) to identify expanded or unchanged investigation clusters. Remaining non investigation clusters are then used to identify novel investigation clusters using the DODGE algorithm detailed in B and C. Green boxes are input files, red outlined boxes are output files, blue arrows represent outputs from one time period used as inputs in the next. D. Investigation clusters identified from the Australian dataset over time. X axis is date of collection by week. Y axis is investigation cluster with MGT ST based ID. The area of circles is proportional to number of isolates in that investigation cluster in that week. Colour represents the genetic threshold used for that investigation cluster. Red outline indicates the week in which the cluster was identified as an investigation cluster by the DODGE algorithm.
