For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented. ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1 that were similar to those seen for XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines. ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2) as well as more recent (EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1) variants. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.\nKinetics and durability of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination\nAuthors: Srivastava, K.; Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Gleason, C.; Monahan, B.; Singh, G.; Abbad, A.; Tcheou, J.; Raskin, A.; Kleiner, G.; van Bakel, H.; Sordillo, E. M.; PARIS Study Group, ; Krammer, F. M.; Simon, V.\nScore: 416.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294679\nWe analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using \u003e8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.\nPost-COVID conditions during Delta and early-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant periods among adults in the United States\nAuthors: Edwards, D. L.; Logan, P.; Feldstein, L.; Accorsi, E.; Fairlie, T.; Saydah, S.\nScore: 212.0, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293776\nBackgroundPost-COVID conditions after infection with new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been incompletely described. We compared the prevalence and risk factors for ongoing symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer (often referred to as post-COVID Conditions) among adults who had tested positive vs. negative during the Delta and early-Omicron periods. MethodsSelf-reported survey data regarding symptoms and previous SARS-CoV 2 test results were collected from May 31 - July 6, 2022, from a probability sampling of United States adults. Respondents were classified according to their test result, predominant circulating variant when respondents first tested positive (Delta vs early-Omicron), and demographic risk factors. ResultsAmong 2,421 respondents, 256 tested positive during Delta, 460 during early-Omicron, and 1,705 always tested negative. Nearly one-fourth (22.3%) of negative respondents reported [\u0026ge;]1symptom that lasted [\u0026ge;]4 weeks, compared to 60.6% (p\u003c0.05) of respondents who tested positive during the Delta period and 47.8% (p\u003c0.05) during the early-Omicron period. Fatigue, change in smell/taste, and cough were commonly reported by respondents who tested positive. Demographic risk factors associated with ongoing symptoms were being female and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55; aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.87). ConclusionThe reported occurrence of ongoing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions was reduced during the early-Omicron period, compared with Delta.\nRetrospective, observational analysis of the first one hundred consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium\nAuthors: Pirnay, J.-P.; Djebara, S.; Steurs, G.; Griselain, J.; Cochez, C.; De Soir, S.; Glonti, T.; Spiessens, A.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Green, S.; Wagemans, J.; Lood, C.; Schrevens, E.; Chanishvili, N.; Kutateladze, M.; de Jode, M.; Ceyssens, P.-J.; Draye, J.-P.; Verbeken, G.; De Vos, D.; Rose, T.; Onsea, J.; Van Nieuwenhuyse, B.; Bacteriophage Therapy Providers, ; Bacteriophage Donors, ; Soentjens, P.; Lavigne, R.; Merabishvili, M.\nScore: 50.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294728\nIn contrast to the many reports of successful cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy, randomized controlled trials of non-personalized bacteriophage products did not bring the expected results. Here, we present the outcomes of a retrospective, observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin \u0026 soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively. Eradication was 70% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds-ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.127-0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage-antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8% (7/16 patients) and 90% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5% (5/13) of screened patients. (BT100 study, ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05498363.)\nImprovement of immune dysregulation and health-related quality of life in individuals with long COVID at 24-months following SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Phetsouphanh, C.; Jacka, B.; Ballouz, S.; Jackson, K. J.; Wilson, D. B.; Manandhar, B.; Klemm, V.; Tan, H.-X.; Wheatley, A.; Aggarwal, A.; Akerman, A.; Milogiannakis, V.; Starr, M.; Cunningham, P.; Turville, S. G.; Kent, S. J.; Byrne, A.; Brew, B. J.; Darley, D. R.; Dore, G. J.; Kelleher, A. D.; Matthews, G. V.\nScore: 37.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.23294704\nThis study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in individuals with long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24-months. LC participants showed elevated spike and nucleocapsid IgG levels, higher neutralizing capacity, and increased spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 3- and 8-months, but these differences did not persist at 24-months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{beta}, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 24-month timepoint revealed similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of naive T and B cell subsets in LC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones were observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24-months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count were associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.\nA molnupiravir-associated mutational signature in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.; Hisner, R.; Donovan-Banfield, I.; Hartman, H.; Lochen, A.; Peacock, T. P.; Ruis, C.\nScore: 2449.4, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.26.23284998\nMolnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm a direct association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.\nProtection conferred by COVID-19 vaccination, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or hybrid immunity against Omicron-associated severe outcomes among community-dwelling adults\nAuthors: Lee, N.; Nguyen, L.; Austin, P. C.; Brown, K. A.; Grewal, R.; Buchan, S. A.; Nasreen, S.; Gubbay, J.; Schwartz, K. L.; Tadrous, M.; Wilson, K.; Wilson, S. E.; Kwong, J. C.\nScore: 20.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294503\nIntroductionWe assessed protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron-associated severe outcomes during successive sublineage-predominant periods. MethodsWe used a test-negative design to estimate protection by vaccines and/or prior infection against hospitalization/death among community-dwelling, PCR-tested adults aged [\u0026ge;]50 years in Ontario, Canada between January 2, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relative change in the odds of hospitalization/death with each vaccine dose (2-5) and/or prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (compared with unvaccinated, uninfected subjects) up to 15 months since the last vaccination or infection. ResultsWe included 18,526 cases with Omicron-associated severe outcomes and 90,778 test-negative controls. Vaccine protection was high during BA.1/BA.2 predominance, but was generally \u003c50% during periods of BA.4/BA.5 and BQ/XBB predominance without boosters. A third/fourth dose transiently increased protection during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 68%, 95%CI 63%-72%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 80%, 95%CI 77%-83%), but was lower and waned quickly during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 59%, 95%CI 48%-67%; 12-month: 49%, 95%CI 41%-56%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 62%, 95%CI 56%-68%, 12-months: 51%, 95%CI 41%-56%). Hybrid immunity conferred nearly 90% protection throughout BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 predominance, but was reduced during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 60%, 95%CI 36%-75%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 63%, 95%CI 42%-76%). Protection was restored with a fifth dose (bivalent; 6-month: 91%, 95%CI 79%-96%). Prior infection alone did not confer lasting protection. ConclusionProtection from COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infections against severe outcomes is reduced when immune-evasive variants/subvariants emerge and may also wane over time. Our findings support a variant-adapted booster vaccination strategy with periodic review.\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection Biomarkers Reveal an Extended RSAD2 Dependant Metabolic Pathway\nAuthors: Sala, S.; Nitschke, P.; Masuda, R.; Gray, N.; Lawler, N.; Wood, J. M.; Butler, J. N.; Berezhnoy, G.; Bolanos, A.; Boughton, B. A.; Lonati, C.; Roessler, T.; Singh, Y.; Wilson, I. D.; Lodge, S.; Morillon, A.-C.; Loo, R. L.; Hall, D.; Whiley, L.; Evans, G. B.; Grove, T. L.; Almo, S. C.; Harris, L. D.; Holmes, E.; Merle, U.; Trautwein, C.; Nicholson, J. K.; Wist, J.\nScore: 27.4, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.08.23289637\nWe present compelling evidence for the existence of an extended innate viperin dependent pathway which provides crucial evidence for an adaptive response to viral agents like SARS-CoV-2. We show the in vivo biosynthesis of a family of endogenous cytosine metabolites with potential antiviral activity. Two dimensional Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed a characteristic spin-system motif indicating the presence of an extended panel of urinary metabolites during the acute viral replication phase. Mass spectrometry additionally allowed the characterization and quantification of the most abundant serum metabolites showing potential diagnostic value of the compounds for viral infections. In total, we unveiled ten nucleoside (cytosine and uracil based) analogue structures, eight of which were previously unknown in humans. The molecular structures of the nucleoside analogues and their correlation with an array of serum cytokines, including IFN-2, IFN-{gamma} and IL-10, suggest an association with the viperin enzyme contributing to an endogenous innate immune defence mechanism against viral infection.\nImmune and behavioral correlates of protection against symptomatic post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Goguet, E.; Olsen, C.; Meyer, W.

H.; Campbell, W.; Robinson, S.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294626\nBackgroundWe sought to determine immune and behavioral pre-infection correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccine infections in a joint analysis of epidemiological and immunological cohort data. MethodsSerum and saliva samples from 176 BNT162b2-vaccinated adults in the Prospective Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion study were collected between October and December 2021 and assessed for serum and saliva levels of Wuhan-1 wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG and IgA binding antibodies (bAb) using a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA). Serum samples were also assessed for WT receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific bAb by two commercial assays, BA.1 S-specific IgG bAb by MMIA, and neutralization activity against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants using a lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay. After the Fall 2021 visit, participants reported all positive PCR and/or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Duration, severity, and type of symptoms, as well as risk exposures and adherence to precautionary measures, were assessed by questionnaires during the Spring 2022 visit. ResultsThirty-two participants (18.2%) developed symptomatic post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections (PVI) between December 7, 2021 and April 1, 2022. Pre-infection WT (geometric mean (GM) of 3,863 vs 2,736 binding antibody unit [BAU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0098) and BA.1 (GM of 276.9 vs 179.9 arbitrary bAb unit [AU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.04) anti-S IgG bAb levels measured by MMIA and neutralizing titers (NT) against BA.1 (GM titer [GMT] of 493.6 vs 286.2, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0313) and BA.1.1 (GMT of 552.0 vs 302.5, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.021) were significantly higher in individuals that did not develop PVIs. WT anti-S bAb levels greater than 5,000 BAU/ml were associated with \u003e 90% protection against symptomatic PVI. In individuals that developed PVI, WT anti-S IgG bAb levels correlated with lower disease severity scores ({rho}= -0.3859, p=0.032) and shorter duration of clinical disease ({rho}= -0.5273, p=0.0023). WT anti-RBD bAb levels measured by commercial assays correlated strongly with bAb levels measured by MMIA ({rho}=0.8239, p\u003c0.0001 and {rho}=0.6929, p\u003c0.0001, Roche and Siemens assays, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance for correlation with protection against PVI. Home risk score, but neither work nor home precautionary measures, correlated strongly with risk of PVI (mean score of 20.77 vs 47.33, uninfected vs PVI respectively, p\u003c0.0001). ConclusionsAnti-S IgG bAb levels (directed against either WT or Omicron BA.1 subvariant) and NTs served as correlates of protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-S (WT) IgG bAb levels remained a significant correlate of protection against PVIs when adjusting for demography and risk behavior. Results of this study also suggest that commercial assays for anti-S bAb may need to be reformatted to enable detection of higher maximum values for use as predictors of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDistinct COVID-19 vaccine combinations result in divergent immune responses\nAuthors: Zaeck, L.

D.; SWITCH-ON Research Group, Score: 18.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294606\nWaning antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination combined with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage led to reduced vaccine effectiveness. As a countermeasure, bivalent mRNA-based booster vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein in combination with that of Omicron BA.1 or BA.5 were introduced. Since then, BA.2-descendent lineages have become dominant, such as XBB.1.5 or BA.2.86. Here, we assessed how different COVID-19 priming regimens affect the immunogenicity of the recently used bivalent booster vaccinations and breakthrough infections. BA.1 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines boosted neutralizing antibodies and T-cells up to 3 months after boost; however, cross-neutralization of XBB.1.5 was poor. Interestingly, different combinations of prime-boost regimens induced divergent responses: participants primed with Ad26.COV2.S developed lower binding antibody levels after bivalent boost while neutralization and T-cell responses were similar to mRNA-based primed participants. In contrast, the breadth of neutralization was higher in mRNA-primed and bivalent BA.5 boosted participants. Combined, we highlight important lessons learned from the employed COVID-19 vaccination strategies. Our data further support the use of monovalent vaccines based on circulating strains when vaccinating risk groups, as recently recommended by the WHO. We emphasize the importance of the continuous assessment of immune responses targeting circulating variants to guide future COVID-19 vaccination policies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSubvariants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) omicron XBB-lineage have the potential to escape immunity provided by prior infection or vaccination. For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented.

ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1 that were similar to those seen for XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines.

ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2) as well as more recent (EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1) variants. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using &gt;8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-COVID conditions after infection with new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been incompletely described. We compared the prevalence and risk factors for ongoing symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer (often referred to as post-COVID Conditions) among adults who had tested positive vs. negative during the Delta and early-Omicron periods.

MethodsSelf-reported survey data regarding symptoms and previous SARS-CoV 2 test results were collected from May 31 - July 6, 2022, from a probability sampling of United States adults. Respondents were classified according to their test result, predominant circulating variant when respondents first tested positive (Delta vs early-Omicron), and demographic risk factors.

ResultsAmong 2,421 respondents, 256 tested positive during Delta, 460 during early-Omicron, and 1,705 always tested negative. Nearly one-fourth (22.3%) of negative respondents reported [&amp;ge;]1symptom that lasted [&amp;ge;]4 weeks, compared to 60.6% (p&lt;0.05) of respondents who tested positive during the Delta period and 47.8% (p&lt;0.05) during the early-Omicron period. Fatigue, change in smell/taste, and cough were commonly reported by respondents who tested positive. Demographic risk factors associated with ongoing symptoms were being female and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55; aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.87).

ConclusionThe reported occurrence of ongoing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions was reduced during the early-Omicron period, compared with Delta.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In contrast to the many reports of successful cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy, randomized controlled trials of non-personalized bacteriophage products did not bring the expected results. Here, we present the outcomes of a retrospective, observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin &amp; soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively. Eradication was 70% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds-ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.127-0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage-antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8% (7/16 patients) and 90% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5% (5/13) of screened patients. (BT100 study, ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05498363.)</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in individuals with long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24-months. LC participants showed elevated spike and nucleocapsid IgG levels, higher neutralizing capacity, and increased spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4&#43; T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells at 3- and 8-months, but these differences did not persist at 24-months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{beta}, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 24-month timepoint revealed similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of naive T and B cell subsets in LC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones were observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24-months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count were associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm a direct association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWe assessed protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron-associated severe outcomes during successive sublineage-predominant periods.

MethodsWe used a test-negative design to estimate protection by vaccines and/or prior infection against hospitalization/death among community-dwelling, PCR-tested adults aged [&amp;ge;]50 years in Ontario, Canada between January 2, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relative change in the odds of hospitalization/death with each vaccine dose (2-5) and/or prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (compared with unvaccinated, uninfected subjects) up to 15 months since the last vaccination or infection.

ResultsWe included 18,526 cases with Omicron-associated severe outcomes and 90,778 test-negative controls. Vaccine protection was high during BA.1/BA.2 predominance, but was generally &lt;50% during periods of BA.4/BA.5 and BQ/XBB predominance without boosters. A third/fourth dose transiently increased protection during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 68%, 95%CI 63%-72%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 80%, 95%CI 77%-83%), but was lower and waned quickly during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 59%, 95%CI 48%-67%; 12-month: 49%, 95%CI 41%-56%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 62%, 95%CI 56%-68%, 12-months: 51%, 95%CI 41%-56%). Hybrid immunity conferred nearly 90% protection throughout BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 predominance, but was reduced during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 60%, 95%CI 36%-75%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 63%, 95%CI 42%-76%). Protection was restored with a fifth dose (bivalent; 6-month: 91%, 95%CI 79%-96%). Prior infection alone did not confer lasting protection.

ConclusionProtection from COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infections against severe outcomes is reduced when immune-evasive variants/subvariants emerge and may also wane over time. Our findings support a variant-adapted booster vaccination strategy with periodic review.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present compelling evidence for the existence of an extended innate viperin dependent pathway which provides crucial evidence for an adaptive response to viral agents like SARS-CoV-2. We show the in vivo biosynthesis of a family of endogenous cytosine metabolites with potential antiviral activity. Two dimensional Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed a characteristic spin-system motif indicating the presence of an extended panel of urinary metabolites during the acute viral replication phase. Mass spectrometry additionally allowed the characterization and quantification of the most abundant serum metabolites showing potential diagnostic value of the compounds for viral infections. In total, we unveiled ten nucleoside (cytosine and uracil based) analogue structures, eight of which were previously unknown in humans. The molecular structures of the nucleoside analogues and their correlation with an array of serum cytokines, including IFN-2, IFN-{gamma} and IL-10, suggest an association with the viperin enzyme contributing to an endogenous innate immune defence mechanism against viral infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe sought to determine immune and behavioral pre-infection correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccine infections in a joint analysis of epidemiological and immunological cohort data.

MethodsSerum and saliva samples from 176 BNT162b2-vaccinated adults in the Prospective Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion study were collected between October and December 2021 and assessed for serum and saliva levels of Wuhan-1 wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG and IgA binding antibodies (bAb) using a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA). Serum samples were also assessed for WT receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific bAb by two commercial assays, BA.1 S-specific IgG bAb by MMIA, and neutralization activity against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants using a lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay. After the Fall 2021 visit, participants reported all positive PCR and/or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Duration, severity, and type of symptoms, as well as risk exposures and adherence to precautionary measures, were assessed by questionnaires during the Spring 2022 visit.

ResultsThirty-two participants (18.2%) developed symptomatic post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections (PVI) between December 7, 2021 and April 1, 2022. Pre-infection WT (geometric mean (GM) of 3,863 vs 2,736 binding antibody unit [BAU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0098) and BA.1 (GM of 276.9 vs 179.9 arbitrary bAb unit [AU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.04) anti-S IgG bAb levels measured by MMIA and neutralizing titers (NT) against BA.1 (GM titer [GMT] of 493.6 vs 286.2, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0313) and BA.1.1 (GMT of 552.0 vs 302.5, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.021) were significantly higher in individuals that did not develop PVIs. WT anti-S bAb levels greater than 5,000 BAU/ml were associated with &gt; 90% protection against symptomatic PVI. In individuals that developed PVI, WT anti-S IgG bAb levels correlated with lower disease severity scores ({rho}= -0.3859, p=0.032) and shorter duration of clinical disease ({rho}= -0.5273, p=0.0023). WT anti-RBD bAb levels measured by commercial assays correlated strongly with bAb levels measured by MMIA ({rho}=0.8239, p&lt;0.0001 and {rho}=0.6929, p&lt;0.0001, Roche and Siemens assays, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance for correlation with protection against PVI. Home risk score, but neither work nor home precautionary measures, correlated strongly with risk of PVI (mean score of 20.77 vs 47.33, uninfected vs PVI respectively, p&lt;0.0001).

ConclusionsAnti-S IgG bAb levels (directed against either WT or Omicron BA.1 subvariant) and NTs served as correlates of protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-S (WT) IgG bAb levels remained a significant correlate of protection against PVIs when adjusting for demography and risk behavior. Results of this study also suggest that commercial assays for anti-S bAb may need to be reformatted to enable detection of higher maximum values for use as predictors of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Waning antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination combined with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage led to reduced vaccine effectiveness. As a countermeasure, bivalent mRNA-based booster vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein in combination with that of Omicron BA.1 or BA.5 were introduced. Since then, BA.2-descendent lineages have become dominant, such as XBB.1.5 or BA.2.86. Here, we assessed how different COVID-19 priming regimens affect the immunogenicity of the recently used bivalent booster vaccinations and breakthrough infections. BA.1 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines boosted neutralizing antibodies and T-cells up to 3 months after boost; however, cross-neutralization of XBB.1.5 was poor. Interestingly, different combinations of prime-boost regimens induced divergent responses: participants primed with Ad26.COV2.S developed lower binding antibody levels after bivalent boost while neutralization and T-cell responses were similar to mRNA-based primed participants. In contrast, the breadth of neutralization was higher in mRNA-primed and bivalent BA.5 boosted participants. Combined, we highlight important  lessons learned from the employed COVID-19 vaccination strategies. Our data further support the use of monovalent vaccines based on circulating strains when vaccinating risk groups, as recently recommended by the WHO. We emphasize the importance of the continuous assessment of immune responses targeting circulating variants to guide future COVID-19 vaccination policies.</p>
