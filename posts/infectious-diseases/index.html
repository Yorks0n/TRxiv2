K.\nScore: 423.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291827\nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.\nSARS-CoV-2 virologic rebound with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir therapy\nAuthors: Edelstein, G. E.; Boucau, J.; Uddin, R.; Marino, C.; Liew, M. Y.; Barry, M.; Choudhary, M. C.; Gilbert, R. F.; Reynolds, Z.; Li, Y.; Tien, D.; Sagar, S.; Vyas, T. D.; Kawano, Y.; Sparks, J. A.; Hammond, S. P.; Wallace, Z.; Vyas, J. M.; Barczak, A. K.; Lemieux, J. E.; Li, J. Z.; Siedner, M. J.\nScore: 122.9, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23288598\nObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound. DesignObservational cohort study. SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts. ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy. Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [\u0026ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to \u003c4.0 log10 copies/milliliter. ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [\u0026ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene. Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.\nRisk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Those Up-to-Date and Not Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Vaccination\nAuthors: Shrestha, N. K.; Burke, P. C.; Nowacki, A. S.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 5156.5, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackgroundThe CDC recently defined being \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than in the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, not being \"up-to-date\" with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, \u003c0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"not up-to-date\" by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.\nInternal tremors and vibrations in long COVID: a cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Zhou, T.; McAlpine, L.; Michelsen, T.; Caraballo, C.; Sawano, M.; Bhattacharjee, B.; Lu, Y.; Iwasaki, A.; Krumholz, H.\nScore: 128.1, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291598\nBackgroundInternal tremors and vibrations symptoms have been described as part of neurologic disorders but have not been fully described as a part of long COVID. We compared demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, pre-pandemic comorbidities, and new-onset conditions between people with internal tremors and vibrations as part of their long COVID symptoms and people with long COVID but without these symptoms. MethodsA cross-sectional study, Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN), collected data from adults with long COVID. The study sample included 423 participants enrolled between May 2022 and June 2023. ResultsThe 423 participants had a median age of 46 years (interquartile range, 38-56), 74% were female, 87% were Non-Hispanic White, and 158 (37%) reported \"internal tremors, or buzzing/vibration\" as a long COVID symptom. Before long COVID, the groups had similar comorbidities. Post-COVID, participants with internal tremors and vibrations had significantly worse health as measured by the Euro-QoL visual analogue scale (median: 40 vs. 50 points, P = 0.007), higher rates of financial difficulties caused by the pandemic and housing insecurity (P \u003c 0.001 for each), and were significantly more likely to have new-onset conditions of mast cell disorders (11% vs. 2.6%), neurologic conditions (22% vs. 8.3%), anxiety (20% vs. 8.7%), and trauma- or stress-related mental health disorders (12% vs. 3.4%) compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni-adjusted P \u003c 0.05 for each). Participants with internal tremors also reported significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurologic long COVID symptoms compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni- adjusted P \u003c 0.05 for each). Conclusions and RelevanceAmong people with long COVID, those with internal tremors and vibrations have more associated symptoms and worse health status, suggesting it may be associated with a severe phenotype of the condition.\nMetformin reduces SARS-CoV-2 in a Phase 3 Randomized Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial\nAuthors: Bramante, C.

D.; Lee, S.; Griffiths, G.; Pullen, M. F.; Thompson, J. L.; Sherwood, N.; Murray, T. A.; Rose, M. R.; Boulware, D. R.; Huling, J. D.\nScore: 1207.3, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23290989\nCurrent antiviral treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not available globally, cannot be used with many medications, and are limited to virus-specific targets.1-3 Biophysical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 replication predicted that protein translation is an especially attractive target for antiviral therapy.4 Literature review identified metformin, widely known as a treatment for diabetes, as a potential suppressor of protein translation via targeting of the host mTor pathway.5 In vitro, metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.6,7 In the COVID-OUT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of COVID-19, metformin had a 42% reduction in ER visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days; a 58% reduction in hospitalizations/death through 28 days, and a 42% reduction in Long COVID through 10 months.8,9 Here we show viral load analysis of specimens collected in the COVID-OUT trial that the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95%CI, -1.05 to -0.06, p=0.027) while there was no virologic effect for ivermectin or fluvoxamine vs placebo. The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and with emerging data.10,11 Our results demonstrate, consistent with model predictions, that a safe, widely available,12 well-tolerated, and inexpensive oral medication, metformin, can be repurposed to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.\nEarly Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin: A Real-Life Monocentric Retrospective Cohort Study of 30,423 COVID-19 Patients\nAuthors: Million, M.; Cortaredona, S.; Delorme, L.; Colson, P.; LEVASSEUR, A.; Tissot-Dupont, H.; bendamardji, K.; Lahouel, S.; LA SCOLA, B.; Camoin, L.; Fenollar, F.; Gautret, P.; Parola, P.; Lagier, J.-C.; Gentile, S.; BROUQUI, P.; Raoult, D.\nScore: 4835.4, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.03.23287649\nThe authors have withdrawn this manuscript because analytic strategies for this project have changed.

S.; Lee, J.; Mehrotra-Varma, S.; Mehrotra-Varma, J.; Hsu, K.; Hilliard, I.; Lee, K.; Li, A.; Essibayi, M. A.; Yee, J.; Altschul, D. J.; Eskandar, E.; Mehler, M. F.; Duong, T. Q.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291883\nBackground and Objectives: Acute neurological manifestations are a common complication of acute COVID-19 disease. This study investigated the 3-year outcomes of patients with and without significant neurological manifestations during initial COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and April 16, 2020 and hospitalized in the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, an epicenter of the early pandemic, were included. Follow-up data was captured up to January 23, 2023 (3 years post COVID-19). This cohort consisted of 414 COVID-19 patients with significant neurological manifestations and 1199 propensity-matched COVID-19 patients without neurological manifestations. Primary outcomes were mortality, stroke, heart attack, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), reinfection, and hospital readmission post-discharge. Secondary outcomes were clinical neuroimaging findings (hemorrhage, active stroke, prior stroke, mass effect, and microhemorrhage, white-matter changes, microvascular disease, and volume loss). Predictive models were used to identify risk factors of mortality post-discharge. Results: More patients in the neurological cohort were discharged to acute rehabilitation (10.54% vs 3.68%, p\u003c0.0001), skilled nursing facilities (30.67% vs 20.78%, p=0.0002) and fewer to home (55.27% vs 70.21%, p\u003c0.0001) compared to the matched controls. Incidence of readmission for any medical reason (65.70% vs 60.72%, p=0.036), stroke (6.28% vs 2.34%, p\u003c0.0001), and MACE (20.53% vs 16.51%, p=0.032) was higher in the neurological cohort post-discharge. Neurological patients were more likely to die post-discharge (58 (14.01%) vs 94 (7.84%), p=0.0001) compared to controls (HR=2.346, 95% CI=(1.586, 3.470), p\u003c0.0001). The major causes of death post-discharge were heart disease (14.47%), sepsis (13.82%), influenza and pneumonia (11.18%), COVID-19 (8.55%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (7.89%). Factors associated with mortality after leaving the hospital were belonging to the neurological cohort (OR=1.802 (1.237, 2.608), p=0.002), discharge disposition (OR=1.508, 95% CI=(1.276, 1.775), p\u003c0.0001), congestive heart failure (OR=2.281 (1.429, 3.593), p=0.0004), higher COVID-19 severity score (OR=1.177 (1.062, 1.304), p=0.002), and older age (OR=1.027 (1.010, 1.044), p=0.002). There were no group differences in gross radiological findings, except the neurological cohort showed significantly more age-adjusted brain volume loss (p\u003c0.05) compared to controls. Discussion: COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations have worse long-term outcomes compared to matched controls. These findings raise awareness and the need for closer monitoring and timely interventions for COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations.\nTargeting Multiple Conserved T-Cell Epitopes for Protection against COVID-19 Moderate-Severe Disease by a Pan-Sarbecovirus Vaccine\nAuthors: Wang, C. Y.; Kuo, B.-S.; Lee, Y.-H.; Ho, Y.-H.; Pan, Y.-H.; Yang, Y.-T.; Chang, H.-C.; Fu, L.-F.; Peng, W.-J.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.23291948\nBackgroundMost of current approved vaccines, based on a Spike-only as single immunogen, fall short of producing a full-blown T-cell immunity. SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with ever-emergent higher-contagious mutants that may take a turn going beyond Omicron to bring about a new pandemic outbreak. New recombinant SARS-CoV-2 species could be man-made through genetic manipulation to infect systemically. Development of composition-innovated, pan-variant COVID-19 vaccines to prevent from hospitalization and severe disease, and to forestall the next pandemic catastrophe, is an urgent global objective. Methods and findingsIn a retrospective, e-questionnaire Observational Study, extended from a clinical Phase-2 trial conducted in Taiwan, during the prime time of Omicron outbreak dominated by BA.2 and BA.5 variants, we investigated the preventive effects against COVID-19 moderate-severe disease (hospitalization and ICU admission) by a pan-Sarbecovirus vaccine UB-612 that targets monomeric S1-RBD-focused subunit protein and five designer peptides comprising sequence-conserved, non-mutable helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Th/CTL) epitopes derived from Spike (S2), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Per UB-612 vaccination, there were no hospitalization and ICU admission cases (0% rate, 6 months after Omicron outbreak) reported [\u0026ge;]14 months post-2nd dose of primary series, and [\u0026ge;]10 months post-booster (3rd dose), to which the potent memory cytotoxic CD8 T cell immunity may be the pivotal in control of the infection disease severity. Six months post-booster, the infection rate (asymptomatic and symptomatic mild) was only 1.2%, which increased to 27.8% observed [\u0026ge;]10 months post-booster. The notable protection effects are in good alignment with a preliminary Phase-3 heterologous booster trial report showing that UB-612 can serve as a competent booster substitute for other EUA-approved vaccine platforms to enhance their seroconversion rate and viral-neutralizing titer against Omicron BA.5. ConclusionsUB-612, a universal multitope vaccine promoting full-blown T cell immunity, may work as a competent primer and booster for persons vulnerable to Sarbecovirus infection. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04773067. AUTHOR SUMMARYA COVID-19 vaccine based on a Spike-only single immunogen would fall short of producing a full-blown, escape-proof T cell immunity. In Omicron era plagued with ever-evolving and higher-contagious SARS-CoV-2 mutants, immune antibodies against variants beyond BA.5 are seen on a cliff drop, rendering the viral-neutralizing titer strength an increasingly less relevant immunity parameter. The true, urgent issue at heart in vaccine development has not been updating variant component to increase antibody titer for prevention of infection, but to validate universal vaccines that would have a potential to head off hospitalization, severe disease and ultimately reinfection altogether, and so to forestall a new catastrophe of pandemic outbreak. To reach the ideal goals, a universal vaccine able to produce potent, broadly recognizing and durable memory T cell immunity would be essential. UB-612, a pan-Sarbecovirus T cell immunity-promoting mutitope vaccine, has been shown to provide strong and long-lasting [\u0026ge;]10 month protective effect against COVID-19 moderate-severe disease (0% cases of hospitalization and ICU admission). UB-612 is a unique S1-RBD subunit protein vaccine armed with five designer peptides comprising sequence-conserved helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Th/CTL) epitopes derived from Spike (S2x3), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins across Sarbecovirus species.\nPre-pandemic activity on a myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome support forum is highly associated with later activity on a long COVID support forum for a variety of reasons: a mixed methods study.\nAuthors: Meyerson, W. U.; Hoyle, R. H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.23292087\nEncephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID share some clinical and social characteristics. We predicted that this would lead to an increased interaction between pre-pandemic members of a ME/CFS online support community and a long COVID community. We performed a mixed-methods retrospective observational study of the Reddit activity of 7,544 users active on Reddit's long COVID forum. From among 1600 forums, pre-pandemic activity specifically on a ME/CFS forum is the top predictor of later participation on the long COVID forum versus an acute COVID support forum. In the qualitative portion, motives for this co-participation included seeking mutual support and dual identification with both conditions. Some of this effect may be explained by pre-existing ME/CFS possibly being a risk factor for long COVID and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection being a cause of ME/CFS relapse. The high rate of ME/CFS patients seeking mutual support on a long COVID forum speaks to the long-suffering experience of these patients not feeling heard or respected, and the hope of some ME/CFS patients to gain legitimacy through the public's growing recognition of long COVID.\nDetection of parasite DNA in soil samples from rural Yucatan, Mexico\nAuthors: Villanueva-Lizama, L.; Cruz-Coral, A.; Teh-Poot, C.; Cruz-Chan, V.; Mejia, R.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291958\nThe soil is the primary environmental reservoir for many parasites transmitted to humans through the fecal-oral route, causing disease. Our environmental study used a high-throughput multi-parallel real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect parasites DNA in soil collected from the outdoor built environments of 34 houses. The total parasite prevalence was Acanthamoeba spp. (53%), Blastocystis spp. (12%), Ascaris lumbricoides (12%), Toxocara canis (9%), Ancylostoma spp. (3%), Trichuris trichiura (3%), Entamoeba histolytica (3%) and Giardia intestinalis (3%). No DNA from Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Toxocara catis, and Cryptosporidium spp was detected. A total of 65% of houses were positive for at least one parasite, 15% had poly-parasites, and up to six different parasites were detected in a single sample. This is the first report of parasites-DNA detected in soil samples from a rural community in Yucatan and suggests higher rates of transmission of parasites with both a zoonotic and medical importance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts.

ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [&amp;ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to &lt;4.0 log10 copies/milliliter.

ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [&amp;ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene.

Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CDC recently defined being &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included.

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#34;not up-to-date&#34; than in the &#34;up-to-date&#34; state. On multivariable analysis, not being &#34;up-to-date&#34; with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, &lt;0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#34;up-to-date&#34; after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine.

ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#34;not up-to-date&#34; by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.

SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34;. The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInternal tremors and vibrations symptoms have been described as part of neurologic disorders but have not been fully described as a part of long COVID. We compared demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, pre-pandemic comorbidities, and new-onset conditions between people with internal tremors and vibrations as part of their long COVID symptoms and people with long COVID but without these symptoms.

MethodsA cross-sectional study, Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN), collected data from adults with long COVID. The study sample included 423 participants enrolled between May 2022 and June 2023.

ResultsThe 423 participants had a median age of 46 years (interquartile range, 38-56), 74% were female, 87% were Non-Hispanic White, and 158 (37%) reported &#34;internal tremors, or buzzing/vibration&#34; as a long COVID symptom. Before long COVID, the groups had similar comorbidities. Post-COVID, participants with internal tremors and vibrations had significantly worse health as measured by the Euro-QoL visual analogue scale (median: 40 vs. 50 points, P = 0.007), higher rates of financial difficulties caused by the pandemic and housing insecurity (P &lt; 0.001 for each), and were significantly more likely to have new-onset conditions of mast cell disorders (11% vs. 2.6%), neurologic conditions (22% vs. 8.3%), anxiety (20% vs. 8.7%), and trauma- or stress-related mental health disorders (12% vs. 3.4%) compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni-adjusted P &lt; 0.05 for each). Participants with internal tremors also reported significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurologic long COVID symptoms compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni- adjusted P &lt; 0.05 for each).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong people with long COVID, those with internal tremors and vibrations have more associated symptoms and worse health status, suggesting it may be associated with a severe phenotype of the condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current antiviral treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not available globally, cannot be used with many medications, and are limited to virus-specific targets.1-3 Biophysical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 replication predicted that protein translation is an especially attractive target for antiviral therapy.4 Literature review identified metformin, widely known as a treatment for diabetes, as a potential suppressor of protein translation via targeting of the host mTor pathway.5 In vitro, metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.6,7 In the COVID-OUT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of COVID-19, metformin had a 42% reduction in ER visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days; a 58% reduction in hospitalizations/death through 28 days, and a 42% reduction in Long COVID through 10 months.8,9 Here we show viral load analysis of specimens collected in the COVID-OUT trial that the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95%CI, -1.05 to -0.06, p=0.027) while there was no virologic effect for ivermectin or fluvoxamine vs placebo. The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and with emerging data.10,11 Our results demonstrate, consistent with model predictions, that a safe, widely available,12 well-tolerated, and inexpensive oral medication, metformin, can be repurposed to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Objectives: Acute neurological manifestations are a common complication of acute COVID-19 disease. This study investigated the 3-year outcomes of patients with and without significant neurological manifestations during initial COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and April 16, 2020 and hospitalized in the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, an epicenter of the early pandemic, were included. Follow-up data was captured up to January 23, 2023 (3 years post COVID-19). This cohort consisted of 414 COVID-19 patients with significant neurological manifestations and 1199 propensity-matched COVID-19 patients without neurological manifestations. Primary outcomes were mortality, stroke, heart attack, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), reinfection, and hospital readmission post-discharge. Secondary outcomes were clinical neuroimaging findings (hemorrhage, active stroke, prior stroke, mass effect, and microhemorrhage, white-matter changes, microvascular disease, and volume loss). Predictive models were used to identify risk factors of mortality post-discharge. Results: More patients in the neurological cohort were discharged to acute rehabilitation (10.54% vs 3.68%, p&lt;0.0001), skilled nursing facilities (30.67% vs 20.78%, p=0.0002) and fewer to home (55.27% vs 70.21%, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the matched controls. Incidence of readmission for any medical reason (65.70% vs 60.72%, p=0.036), stroke (6.28% vs 2.34%, p&lt;0.0001), and MACE (20.53% vs 16.51%, p=0.032) was higher in the neurological cohort post-discharge. Neurological patients were more likely to die post-discharge (58 (14.01%) vs 94 (7.84%), p=0.0001) compared to controls (HR=2.346, 95% CI=(1.586, 3.470), p&lt;0.0001). The major causes of death post-discharge were heart disease (14.47%), sepsis (13.82%), influenza and pneumonia (11.18%), COVID-19 (8.55%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (7.89%). Factors associated with mortality after leaving the hospital were belonging to the neurological cohort (OR=1.802 (1.237, 2.608), p=0.002), discharge disposition (OR=1.508, 95% CI=(1.276, 1.775), p&lt;0.0001), congestive heart failure (OR=2.281 (1.429, 3.593), p=0.0004), higher COVID-19 severity score (OR=1.177 (1.062, 1.304), p=0.002), and older age (OR=1.027 (1.010, 1.044), p=0.002). There were no group differences in gross radiological findings, except the neurological cohort showed significantly more age-adjusted brain volume loss (p&lt;0.05) compared to controls. Discussion: COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations have worse long-term outcomes compared to matched controls. These findings raise awareness and the need for closer monitoring and timely interventions for COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMost of current approved vaccines, based on a Spike-only as single immunogen, fall short of producing a full-blown T-cell immunity. SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with ever-emergent higher-contagious mutants that may take a turn going beyond Omicron to bring about a new pandemic outbreak. New recombinant SARS-CoV-2 species could be man-made through genetic manipulation to infect systemically. Development of composition-innovated, pan-variant COVID-19 vaccines to prevent from hospitalization and severe disease, and to forestall the next pandemic catastrophe, is an urgent global objective.

Methods and findingsIn a retrospective, e-questionnaire Observational Study, extended from a clinical Phase-2 trial conducted in Taiwan, during the prime time of Omicron outbreak dominated by BA.2 and BA.5 variants, we investigated the preventive effects against COVID-19 moderate-severe disease (hospitalization and ICU admission) by a pan-Sarbecovirus vaccine UB-612 that targets monomeric S1-RBD-focused subunit protein and five designer peptides comprising sequence-conserved, non-mutable helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Th/CTL) epitopes derived from Spike (S2), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Per UB-612 vaccination, there were no hospitalization and ICU admission cases (0% rate, 6 months after Omicron outbreak) reported [&amp;ge;]14 months post-2nd dose of primary series, and [&amp;ge;]10 months post-booster (3rd dose), to which the potent memory cytotoxic CD8 T cell immunity may be the pivotal in control of the infection disease severity. Six months post-booster, the infection rate (asymptomatic and symptomatic mild) was only 1.2%, which increased to 27.8% observed [&amp;ge;]10 months post-booster. The notable protection effects are in good alignment with a preliminary Phase-3 heterologous booster trial report showing that UB-612 can serve as a competent booster substitute for other EUA-approved vaccine platforms to enhance their seroconversion rate and viral-neutralizing titer against Omicron BA.5.

ConclusionsUB-612, a universal multitope vaccine promoting full-blown T cell immunity, may work as a competent primer and booster for persons vulnerable to Sarbecovirus infection.

Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04773067.

AUTHOR SUMMARYA COVID-19 vaccine based on a Spike-only single immunogen would fall short of producing a full-blown, escape-proof T cell immunity. In Omicron era plagued with ever-evolving and higher-contagious SARS-CoV-2 mutants, immune antibodies against variants beyond BA.5 are seen on a cliff drop, rendering the viral-neutralizing titer strength an increasingly less relevant immunity parameter. The true, urgent issue at heart in vaccine development has not been updating variant component to increase antibody titer for prevention of infection, but to validate universal vaccines that would have a potential to head off hospitalization, severe disease and ultimately reinfection altogether, and so to forestall a new catastrophe of pandemic outbreak. To reach the ideal goals, a universal vaccine able to produce potent, broadly recognizing and durable memory T cell immunity would be essential. UB-612, a pan-Sarbecovirus T cell immunity-promoting mutitope vaccine, has been shown to provide strong and long-lasting [&amp;ge;]10 month protective effect against COVID-19 moderate-severe disease (0% cases of hospitalization and ICU admission). UB-612 is a unique S1-RBD subunit protein vaccine armed with five designer peptides comprising sequence-conserved helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Th/CTL) epitopes derived from Spike (S2x3), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins across Sarbecovirus species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID share some clinical and social characteristics. We predicted that this would lead to an increased interaction between pre-pandemic members of a ME/CFS online support community and a long COVID community. We performed a mixed-methods retrospective observational study of the Reddit activity of 7,544 users active on Reddit&#39;s long COVID forum. From among 1600 forums, pre-pandemic activity specifically on a ME/CFS forum is the top predictor of later participation on the long COVID forum versus an acute COVID support forum. In the qualitative portion, motives for this co-participation included seeking mutual support and dual identification with both conditions. Some of this effect may be explained by pre-existing ME/CFS possibly being a risk factor for long COVID and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection being a cause of ME/CFS relapse. The high rate of ME/CFS patients seeking mutual support on a long COVID forum speaks to the long-suffering experience of these patients not feeling heard or respected, and the hope of some ME/CFS patients to gain legitimacy through the public&#39;s growing recognition of long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The soil is the primary environmental reservoir for many parasites transmitted to humans through the fecal-oral route, causing disease. Our environmental study used a high-throughput multi-parallel real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect parasites DNA in soil collected from the outdoor built environments of 34 houses. The total parasite prevalence was Acanthamoeba spp. (53%), Blastocystis spp. (12%), Ascaris lumbricoides (12%), Toxocara canis (9%), Ancylostoma spp. (3%), Trichuris trichiura (3%), Entamoeba histolytica (3%) and Giardia intestinalis (3%). No DNA from Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Toxocara catis, and Cryptosporidium spp was detected. A total of 65% of houses were positive for at least one parasite, 15% had poly-parasites, and up to six different parasites were detected in a single sample. This is the first report of parasites-DNA detected in soil samples from a rural community in Yucatan and suggests higher rates of transmission of parasites with both a zoonotic and medical importance.</p>
