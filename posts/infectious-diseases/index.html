D.\nScore: 308.1, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292649\nTo understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC. Onset Sentence SummaryEarly viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC.\nRisk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during multiple Omicron variant waves in the UK general population\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Stoesser, N.; Matthews, P.; Khera, T.; Gethings, O.; Diamond, I.; Studley, R.; Taylor, N.; peto, t. E.; Walker, A. S.; Pouwels, K.; Eyre, D. W.\nScore: 123.5, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292043\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [\u0026ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally \u003e1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those \u003e180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.\nNationally representative prevalence and determinants of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) amongst Mexican adults in 2022\nAuthors: Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Fermin-Martinez, C. A.; Fernandez-Chirino, L.; Ramirez-Garcia, D.; Vargas-Vazquez, A.; Basile-Alvarez, M. R.; Sanchez-Castro, P.; Nunez-Luna, A.; Antonio-Villa, N. E.\nScore: 51.3, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292475\nOBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data. METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [\u0026ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [\u0026ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights. RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [\u0026ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [\u0026ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance. CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.\nRapid Identification of Bacterial isolates Using Microfluidic Adaptive Channels and Multiplexed Fluorescence Microscopy\nAuthors: Chatzimichail, S.; Turner, P. B.; Feehily, C.; Farrar, A. E.; Crook, D.; Andersson, M.; Oakley, S.; Barrett, L.; El Sayyed, H.; Kyropoulos, J.; Nellaker, C.; Stoesser, N.; Kapanidis, A. N.\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292615\nWe demonstrate the rapid capture, enrichment, and identification of bacterial pathogens using Adaptive Channel Bacterial Capture (ACBC) devices. Using controlled tuning of device backpressure in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices, we enable the controlled formation of capture regions capable of trapping bacteria from low cell density samples with near 100% capture efficiency. The technical demands to prepare such devices are much lower compared to conventional methods for bacterial trapping and can be achieved with simple benchtop fabrication methods. We demonstrate the capture and identification of seven species of bacteria with bacterial concentrations lower than 1000 cells/mL, including common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. We further demonstrate that species identification of the trapped bacteria can be undertaken in the order of one-hour using multiplexed 16S rRNA-FISH with identification accuracies of 73-99% with unsupervised classification methods.\nIncreased circulating fibronectin, depletion of natural IgM and heightened EBV, HSV-1 reactivation in ME/CFS and long COVID\nAuthors: Liu, Z.; Hollmann, C.; Kalanidhi, S.; Grothey, A.; Keating, S.; Mena-Palomo, I.; Lamer, S.; Schlosser, A.; Kaiping, A.; Scheller, C.; Sotzny, F.; Horn, A.; Nuernberger, C.; Cejka, V.; Afshar, B.; Bahmer, T.; Schreiber, S.; Janne Vehreschild, J.; Milljukov, O.; Schaefer, C.; Kretzler, L.; Keil, T.; Reese, J.-P.; Eichner, F. A.; Schmidbauer, L.; Heuschmann, P. U.; Stoerk, S.; Morbach, C.; Riemekasten, G.; Beyersdorf, N.; Scheibenbogen, C.; Naviaux, R. K.; Williams, M.; Ariza, M. E.; Prusty, B. K.\nScore: 474.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291827\nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.\nSystems immunology reveals the molecular mechanisms of heterogeneous influenza vaccine response in the elderly\nAuthors: Dileep Kumar, S.; Zoodsma, M.; Nguyen, N.; Pedroso, R.; Trittel, S.; Riese, P.; Bottey-Bataller, J.; Zhou, L.; Alaswad, A.; Arshad, H.; Netea, M.; Xu, C.-J.; Pessler, F.; Guzman, C. A.; Graca, L.; Li, Y.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292445\nVaccination-induced protection against influenza is greatly diminished and increasingly heterogeneous with age. We investigated longitudinally (up to five timepoints) a cohort of 234 elderly influenza vaccinees across two independent seasons including up to six modalities (multi-omics and immunological parameters). System-level analyses revealed responders exhibited time-dependent changes attributed to a productive vaccine response across all omics layers whereas non-responders did not follow such dynamics, suggestive of systemic dysregulation. Through multi-omics integration, we identified key metabolites and proteins and their likely role in immune response to vaccination. High pre-vaccination IL-15 concentrations negatively associated with antibody production, further supported by experimental validation in mice revealing an IL-15-driven NK-cell axis with a suppressing role on antibody production. Finally, we propose certain long-chain fatty acids as modulators of persistent inflammation in non-responders. Our findings highlight the potential for stratification of vaccinees and open avenues for possible pharmacological interventions to enhance vaccine responses. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPre-vaccination pro-inflammatory status impedes vaccine responsiveness in the elderly. C_LIO_LIMulti-omics integration reveals key molecules involved in vaccine response. C_LIO_LIHigh pre-vaccination concentrations of IL-15 suppresses vaccine response through NK cell activation. C_LIO_LICertain long-chain fatty acids may act as modulators against chronic inflammation and are potential targets to improve vaccine response.

L.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292426\nOBJECTIVEThis study was designed to investigate intranasal lavage with a hypochlorous acid solution in the reduction of symptoms in the ambulatory COVID-19 patient. STUDY DESIGNStudy approval granted by the Institutional Review Board of Reading Hospital (IRB 036-20), with informed consent obtained from all adult participants(age\u003e18 years). SETTINGAll enrollees, taken from the same ambulatory testing facility, received nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing by reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR) or the COVID-19 antigen specific test (Binax NOW, Abbott Lab) METHODSConvenience sampling methodology was utilized. Each enrollee was provided with the study devices which included a Nasaflo Neti Pot (NeilMed Pharmaceutical, Inc.), and the hypochlorous acid solution (Vashe Wound Solution, Urgo Medical North America, LLC). Participants were instructed to irrigate each nostril with 120 cc (four ounces) of the solution for ten consecutive days, and record the presence or absence of symptoms in a scripted diary log. RESULTSThe study included 88 patients of which 74 (84.1%) completed the ten days of nasal lavage. All data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25.0. Chi square test of association found no significant difference related to gender, age group race, ethnicity, residence, or living arrangements (all p-values \u003e 0.05). There were no statistical differences in any of the co-morbid conditions. Mild adverse reactions included burning, epistaxis, and oral metallic taste. No enrollees required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONThis study suggests the feasibility and safety of using intranasal lavage with a hypochlorous acid solution in relieving symptoms in the ambulatory Covid-19 patient.\nTwo Decades of Endemic Dengue in Bangladesh (2000-2022): Trends, Seasonality, and impact of Temperature and Rainfall Patterns on transmission dynamics\nAuthors: Hasan, M. N.; Khalil, I.; Chowdhury, M. A. B.; Rahman, M.; Asaduzzaman, M.; Billah, M.; Banu, L. A.; Alam, M.-U.; Ahsan, A.; Traore, T.; Uddin, M. J.; Galizi, R.; Russo, I.; Zumla, A.; Haider, N.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292380\nBackgroundThe objectives of this study were to compare the dengue virus (DENV) infection, deaths, case-fatality ratio, as well as meteorological parameters between the first and and the recent decade (2000-2010 vs. 2011-2022) and to understand the trends, seasonality, and impact of change of temperature and rainfall pattern on transmission dynamics of Dengue in Bangladesh MethodsFor the period 2000-2022, dengue cases and death data from Bangladeshs Ministry of Health and Family Welfares website, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department were analyzed. Mann-Kendall and Sens slop tests were used for trends and variations and fitted a time series Poisson regression model to identify the impact of meteorological parameters on the incidence of dengue cases. A forecast of dengue cases was performed using an autoregressive integrated moving average model. ResultsOver the past 22 years, a total of 244,246 dengue cases were reported including 849 deaths (Case fatality ratio [CFR] =0.34%). The mean annual number of dengue cases increased eight-fold during the second decade, with 2216 cases during 2000-2011 vs. 18,321 during 2012-2022. The mean annual deaths have doubled (21 vs. 46) although the overall CFR had decreased to one-third (0.69 vs 0.24). Between the periods, the annual temperature increased by 0.49 {degrees}C, and rainfall decreased by 314 mm despite increasing unusual rainfall in the pre-and-post monsoon period. An increasing trend of dengue cases is observed with a much stiffer rise after 2018. Monthly mean temperature (Incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 1.26), first-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.08), and second-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.17) were significantly associated with monthly dengue incidence. ConclusionsThe increased local temperature and unusual rainfall might have contributed to the increased incidence of DENV infection in Bangladesh. Community engagement, vector control, and destruction of mosquito habitats are key to controlling dengue.\nHigh resolution imaging and five-year tuberculosis contact outcomes\nAuthors: Esmail, H.; Coussens, A.

R.; Horsburgh, C. R.; Salgame, P.; Alland, D.; Barry, C. E.; Flynn, J. L.; Ellner, J. J.; Wilkinson, R. J.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292111\nBackgroundThe evolution of tuberculosis (TB) disease during the clinical latency period remains incompletely understood. Methods250 HIV-uninfected, adult household contacts of rifampicin-resistant TB with a negative symptom screen underwent baseline 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT), repeated in 112 after 5-15 months. Following South African and WHO guidelines, participants did not receive preventive therapy. All participants had intensive baseline screening with spontaneous, followed by induced, sputum sampling and were then observed for an average of 4.7 years for culture-positive disease. Baseline PET/CT abnormalities were evaluated in relation to culture-positive disease. ResultsAt baseline, 59 (23.6%) participants had lung PET/CT findings consistent with TB of which 29 (11.6%) were defined as Subclinical TB, and 30 (12%) Subclinical TB-inactive. A further 83 (33.2%) had other lung parenchymal abnormalities and 108 (43.2%) had normal lungs. Over 1107-person years of follow-up 14 cases of culture-positive TB were diagnosed. Six cases were detected by intensive baseline screening, all would have been missed by the South African symptom-based screening strategy and only one detected by a WHO-recommended chest X-Ray screening strategy. Those with baseline Subclinical TB lesions on PET/CT were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with culture-positive TB over the study period, compared to those with normal lung parenchyma (10/29 [34.5%] vs 2/108 [1.9%], Hazard Ratio 22.37 [4.89-102.47, p\u003c0.001]). ConclusionsThese findings challenge the latent/active TB paradigm demonstrating that subclinical disease exists up to 4 years prior to microbiological detection and/or symptom onset. There are important implications for screening and management of TB.\nSARS-CoV-2 virologic rebound with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir therapy\nAuthors: Edelstein, G.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [\u0026ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to \u003c4.0 log10 copies/milliliter. ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [\u0026ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene. Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [&amp;ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally &gt;1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those &gt;180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [&amp;ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [&amp;ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights.

RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [&amp;ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [&amp;ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance.

CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We demonstrate the rapid capture, enrichment, and identification of bacterial pathogens using Adaptive Channel Bacterial Capture (ACBC) devices. Using controlled tuning of device backpressure in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices, we enable the controlled formation of capture regions capable of trapping bacteria from low cell density samples with near 100% capture efficiency. The technical demands to prepare such devices are much lower compared to conventional methods for bacterial trapping and can be achieved with simple benchtop fabrication methods. We demonstrate the capture and identification of seven species of bacteria with bacterial concentrations lower than 1000 cells/mL, including common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. We further demonstrate that species identification of the trapped bacteria can be undertaken in the order of one-hour using multiplexed 16S rRNA-FISH with identification accuracies of 73-99% with unsupervised classification methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vaccination-induced protection against influenza is greatly diminished and increasingly heterogeneous with age. We investigated longitudinally (up to five timepoints) a cohort of 234 elderly influenza vaccinees across two independent seasons including up to six modalities (multi-omics and immunological parameters). System-level analyses revealed responders exhibited time-dependent changes attributed to a productive vaccine response across all omics layers whereas non-responders did not follow such dynamics, suggestive of systemic dysregulation. Through multi-omics integration, we identified key metabolites and proteins and their likely role in immune response to vaccination. High pre-vaccination IL-15 concentrations negatively associated with antibody production, further supported by experimental validation in mice revealing an IL-15-driven NK-cell axis with a suppressing role on antibody production. Finally, we propose certain long-chain fatty acids as modulators of persistent inflammation in non-responders. Our findings highlight the potential for stratification of vaccinees and open avenues for possible pharmacological interventions to enhance vaccine responses.

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEThis study was designed to investigate intranasal lavage with a hypochlorous acid solution in the reduction of symptoms in the ambulatory COVID-19 patient.

STUDY DESIGNStudy approval granted by the Institutional Review Board of Reading Hospital (IRB 036-20), with informed consent obtained from all adult participants(age&gt;18 years).

SETTINGAll enrollees, taken from the same ambulatory testing facility, received nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing by reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR) or the COVID-19 antigen specific test (Binax NOW, Abbott Lab)

METHODSConvenience sampling methodology was utilized. Each enrollee was provided with the study devices which included a Nasaflo Neti Pot (NeilMed Pharmaceutical, Inc.), and the hypochlorous acid solution (Vashe Wound Solution, Urgo Medical North America, LLC). Participants were instructed to irrigate each nostril with 120 cc (four ounces) of the solution for ten consecutive days, and record the presence or absence of symptoms in a scripted diary log.

RESULTSThe study included 88 patients of which 74 (84.1%) completed the ten days of nasal lavage. All data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25.0.

Chi square test of association found no significant difference related to gender, age group race, ethnicity, residence, or living arrangements (all p-values &gt; 0.05). There were no statistical differences in any of the co-morbid conditions. Mild adverse reactions included burning, epistaxis, and oral metallic taste. No enrollees required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths.

CONCLUSIONThis study suggests the feasibility and safety of using intranasal lavage with a hypochlorous acid solution in relieving symptoms in the ambulatory Covid-19 patient.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe objectives of this study were to compare the dengue virus (DENV) infection, deaths, case-fatality ratio, as well as meteorological parameters between the first and and the recent decade (2000-2010 vs. 2011-2022) and to understand the trends, seasonality, and impact of change of temperature and rainfall pattern on transmission dynamics of Dengue in Bangladesh

MethodsFor the period 2000-2022, dengue cases and death data from Bangladeshs Ministry of Health and Family Welfares website, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department were analyzed. Mann-Kendall and Sens slop tests were used for trends and variations and fitted a time series Poisson regression model to identify the impact of meteorological parameters on the incidence of dengue cases. A forecast of dengue cases was performed using an autoregressive integrated moving average model.

ResultsOver the past 22 years, a total of 244,246 dengue cases were reported including 849 deaths (Case fatality ratio [CFR] =0.34%). The mean annual number of dengue cases increased eight-fold during the second decade, with 2216 cases during 2000-2011 vs. 18,321 during 2012-2022. The mean annual deaths have doubled (21 vs. 46) although the overall CFR had decreased to one-third (0.69 vs 0.24). Between the periods, the annual temperature increased by 0.49 {degrees}C, and rainfall decreased by 314 mm despite increasing unusual rainfall in the pre-and-post monsoon period. An increasing trend of dengue cases is observed with a much stiffer rise after 2018. Monthly mean temperature (Incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 1.26), first-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.08), and second-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.17) were significantly associated with monthly dengue incidence.

ConclusionsThe increased local temperature and unusual rainfall might have contributed to the increased incidence of DENV infection in Bangladesh. Community engagement, vector control, and destruction of mosquito habitats are key to controlling dengue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe evolution of tuberculosis (TB) disease during the clinical latency period remains incompletely understood.

Methods250 HIV-uninfected, adult household contacts of rifampicin-resistant TB with a negative symptom screen underwent baseline 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT), repeated in 112 after 5-15 months. Following South African and WHO guidelines, participants did not receive preventive therapy. All participants had intensive baseline screening with spontaneous, followed by induced, sputum sampling and were then observed for an average of 4.7 years for culture-positive disease. Baseline PET/CT abnormalities were evaluated in relation to culture-positive disease.

ResultsAt baseline, 59 (23.6%) participants had lung PET/CT findings consistent with TB of which 29 (11.6%) were defined as Subclinical TB, and 30 (12%) Subclinical TB-inactive. A further 83 (33.2%) had other lung parenchymal abnormalities and 108 (43.2%) had normal lungs. Over 1107-person years of follow-up 14 cases of culture-positive TB were diagnosed. Six cases were detected by intensive baseline screening, all would have been missed by the South African symptom-based screening strategy and only one detected by a WHO-recommended chest X-Ray screening strategy. Those with baseline Subclinical TB lesions on PET/CT were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with culture-positive TB over the study period, compared to those with normal lung parenchyma (10/29 [34.5%] vs 2/108 [1.9%], Hazard Ratio 22.37 [4.89-102.47, p&lt;0.001]).

ConclusionsThese findings challenge the latent/active TB paradigm demonstrating that subclinical disease exists up to 4 years prior to microbiological detection and/or symptom onset. There are important implications for screening and management of TB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts.

ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [&amp;ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to &lt;4.0 log10 copies/milliliter.

ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [&amp;ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene.

Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.</p>
