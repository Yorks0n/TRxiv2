K.\nScore: 432.5, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291827\nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.\nSARS-CoV-2 virologic rebound with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir therapy\nAuthors: Edelstein, G. E.; Boucau, J.; Uddin, R.; Marino, C.; Liew, M. Y.; Barry, M.; Choudhary, M. C.; Gilbert, R. F.; Reynolds, Z.; Li, Y.; Tien, D.; Sagar, S.; Vyas, T. D.; Kawano, Y.; Sparks, J. A.; Hammond, S. P.; Wallace, Z.; Vyas, J. M.; Barczak, A. K.; Lemieux, J. E.; Li, J. Z.; Siedner, M. J.\nScore: 161.5, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23288598\nObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound. DesignObservational cohort study. SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts. ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy. Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [\u0026ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to \u003c4.0 log10 copies/milliliter. ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [\u0026ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene. Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.\nRisk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Those Up-to-Date and Not Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Vaccination\nAuthors: Shrestha, N. K.; Burke, P. C.; Nowacki, A. S.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 5162.9, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackgroundThe CDC recently defined being \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than in the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, not being \"up-to-date\" with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, \u003c0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"not up-to-date\" by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.\nHealthy adults possess cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition antibodies to an A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b avian influenza virus A/Black Faced Spoonbill/Hong Kong/AFCD-HKU-22-21429-01012/2022\nAuthors: Daulagala, P.; Cheng, S.

NI titers to A(H5N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were correlated.\nRisk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during multiple Omicron variant waves in the UK general population\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Stoesser, N.; Matthews, P.; Khera, T.; Gethings, O.; Diamond, I.; Studley, R.; Taylor, N.; peto, t. E.; Walker, A. S.; Pouwels, K.; Eyre, D. W.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292043\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [\u0026ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally \u003e1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those \u003e180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.\nA new Omicron lineage with Spike Y451H mutation that dominated a new COVID-19 wave in Kilifi, Coastal Kenya: March-May 2023\nAuthors: Mwanga, M. J.; LAMBISIA, A. W.; Morobe, J. M.; Murunga, N.; Moraa, E.; Ndwiga, L.; Robinson, C.; Mutunga, M.; Guzman Rincon, L. M.; Sande, C.; Mwangangi, J.; Bejon, P.; Ochola-Oyier, l. I.; Nokes, J.; Agoti, C. N.; Nyiro, J.; Githinji, G.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292158\nWe report a newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage, named FY.4, that has two unique mutations; spike:Y451H and ORF3a:P42L. FY.4 emergence has coincided with increased SARS-CoV-2 cases in coastal Kenya, April-May 2023. We demonstrate the value of continued SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in the post-acute pandemic era in understanding new COVID-19 outbreaks.\nIdentification of a molnupiravir-associated mutational signature in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.; Hisner, R.; Donovan-Banfield, I.; Hartman, H.; Lochen, A.; Peacock, T.; Ruis, C.\nScore: 2271.9, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.26.23284998\nMolnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load 2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm the association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.\nEarly Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin: A Real-Life Monocentric Retrospective Cohort Study of 30,423 COVID-19 Patients\nAuthors: Million, M.; Cortaredona, S.; Delorme, L.; Colson, P.; LEVASSEUR, A.; Tissot-Dupont, H.; bendamardji, K.; Lahouel, S.; LA SCOLA, B.; Camoin, L.; Fenollar, F.; Gautret, P.; Parola, P.; Lagier, J.-C.; Gentile, S.; BROUQUI, P.; Raoult, D.\nScore: 4838.4, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.03.23287649\nThe authors have withdrawn this manuscript because analytic strategies for this project have changed.

Q.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291883\nBackground and ObjectivesAcute neurological manifestations are a common complication of acute COVID-19 disease. This study investigated the 3-year outcomes of patients with and without significant neurological manifestations during initial COVID-19 hospitalization. MethodsPatients infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and April 16, 2020 and hospitalized in the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, an epicenter of the early pandemic, were included. Follow-up data was captured up to January 23, 2023 (3 years post COVID-19). This cohort consisted of 414 COVID-19 patients with significant neurological manifestations and 1199 propensity-matched COVID- 19 patients without neurological manifestations. Primary outcomes were mortality, stroke, heart attack, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), reinfection, and hospital readmission post-discharge. Secondary outcomes were clinical neuroimaging findings (hemorrhage, active stroke, prior stroke, mass effect, and microhemorrhage, white-matter changes, microvascular disease, and volume loss). Predictive models were used to identify risk factors of mortality post-discharge. ResultsMore patients in the neurological cohort were discharged to acute rehabilitation (10.54% vs 3.68%, p\u003c0.0001), skilled nursing facilities (30.67% vs 20.78%, p=0.0002) and fewer to home (55.27% vs 70.21%, p\u003c0.0001) compared to the matched controls. Incidence of readmission for any medical reason (65.70% vs 60.72%, p=0.036), stroke (6.28% vs 2.34%, p\u003c0.0001), and MACE (20.53% vs 16.51%, p=0.032) was higher in the neurological cohort post-discharge. Neurological patients were more likely to die post-discharge (58 (14.01%) vs 94 (7.84%), p=0.0001) compared to controls (HR=2.346, 95% CI=(1.586, 3.470), p\u003c0.0001). The major causes of death post-discharge were heart disease (14.47%), sepsis (13.82%), influenza and pneumonia (11.18%), COVID-19 (8.55%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (7.89%). Factors associated with mortality after leaving the hospital were belonging to the neurological cohort (OR=1.802 (1.237, 2.608), p=0.002), discharge disposition (OR=1.508, 95% CI=(1.276, 1.775), p\u003c0.0001), congestive heart failure (OR=2.281 (1.429, 3.593), p=0.0004), higher COVID-19 severity score (OR=1.177 (1.062, 1.304), p=0.002), and older age (OR=1.027 (1.010, 1.044), p=0.002). There were no group differences in gross radiological findings, except the neurological cohort showed significantly more age-adjusted brain volume loss (p\u003c0.05) compared to controls. DiscussionCOVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations have worse long-term outcomes compared to matched controls. These findings raise awareness and the need for closer monitoring and timely interventions for COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations.\nPre-pandemic activity on a myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome support forum is highly associated with later activity on a long COVID support forum for a variety of reasons: a mixed methods study.\nAuthors: Meyerson, W. U.; Hoyle, R. H.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.23292087\nEncephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID share some clinical and social characteristics. We predicted that this would lead to an increased interaction between pre-pandemic members of an ME/CFS online support community and a long COVID community. We performed a mixed-methods retrospective observational study of the Reddit activity of 7,544 users active on Reddits long COVID forum. From among 1600 forums, pre-pandemic activity specifically on a ME/CFS forum is the top predictor of later participation on the long COVID forum versus an acute COVID support forum. In the qualitative portion, motives for this co-participation included seeking mutual support and dual identification with both conditions. Some of this effect may be explained by pre-existing ME/CFS possibly being a risk factor for long COVID and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection being a cause of ME/CFS relapse. The high rate of ME/CFS patients seeking mutual support on a long COVID forum speaks to the longsuffering experience of these patients not feeling heard or respected, and the hope of some ME/CFS patients to gain legitimacy through the publics growing recognition of long COVID.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts.

ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [&amp;ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to &lt;4.0 log10 copies/milliliter.

ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [&amp;ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene.

Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CDC recently defined being &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included.

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#34;not up-to-date&#34; than in the &#34;up-to-date&#34; state. On multivariable analysis, not being &#34;up-to-date&#34; with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, &lt;0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#34;up-to-date&#34; after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine.

ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#34;not up-to-date&#34; by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.

SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34;. The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [&amp;ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally &gt;1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those &gt;180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load 2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm the association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectivesAcute neurological manifestations are a common complication of acute COVID-19 disease. This study investigated the 3-year outcomes of patients with and without significant neurological manifestations during initial COVID-19 hospitalization.

MethodsPatients infected by SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and April 16, 2020 and hospitalized in the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, an epicenter of the early pandemic, were included. Follow-up data was captured up to January 23, 2023 (3 years post COVID-19). This cohort consisted of 414 COVID-19 patients with significant neurological manifestations and 1199 propensity-matched COVID- 19 patients without neurological manifestations. Primary outcomes were mortality, stroke, heart attack, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), reinfection, and hospital readmission post-discharge. Secondary outcomes were clinical neuroimaging findings (hemorrhage, active stroke, prior stroke, mass effect, and microhemorrhage, white-matter changes, microvascular disease, and volume loss). Predictive models were used to identify risk factors of mortality post-discharge.

ResultsMore patients in the neurological cohort were discharged to acute rehabilitation (10.54% vs 3.68%, p&lt;0.0001), skilled nursing facilities (30.67% vs 20.78%, p=0.0002) and fewer to home (55.27% vs 70.21%, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the matched controls. Incidence of readmission for any medical reason (65.70% vs 60.72%, p=0.036), stroke (6.28% vs 2.34%, p&lt;0.0001), and MACE (20.53% vs 16.51%, p=0.032) was higher in the neurological cohort post-discharge. Neurological patients were more likely to die post-discharge (58 (14.01%) vs 94 (7.84%), p=0.0001) compared to controls (HR=2.346, 95% CI=(1.586, 3.470), p&lt;0.0001). The major causes of death post-discharge were heart disease (14.47%), sepsis (13.82%), influenza and pneumonia (11.18%), COVID-19 (8.55%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (7.89%). Factors associated with mortality after leaving the hospital were belonging to the neurological cohort (OR=1.802 (1.237, 2.608), p=0.002), discharge disposition (OR=1.508, 95% CI=(1.276, 1.775), p&lt;0.0001), congestive heart failure (OR=2.281 (1.429, 3.593), p=0.0004), higher COVID-19 severity score (OR=1.177 (1.062, 1.304), p=0.002), and older age (OR=1.027 (1.010, 1.044), p=0.002). There were no group differences in gross radiological findings, except the neurological cohort showed significantly more age-adjusted brain volume loss (p&lt;0.05) compared to controls.

DiscussionCOVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations have worse long-term outcomes compared to matched controls. These findings raise awareness and the need for closer monitoring and timely interventions for COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID share some clinical and social characteristics. We predicted that this would lead to an increased interaction between pre-pandemic members of an ME/CFS online support community and a long COVID community. We performed a mixed-methods retrospective observational study of the Reddit activity of 7,544 users active on Reddits long COVID forum. From among 1600 forums, pre-pandemic activity specifically on a ME/CFS forum is the top predictor of later participation on the long COVID forum versus an acute COVID support forum. In the qualitative portion, motives for this co-participation included seeking mutual support and dual identification with both conditions. Some of this effect may be explained by pre-existing ME/CFS possibly being a risk factor for long COVID and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection being a cause of ME/CFS relapse. The high rate of ME/CFS patients seeking mutual support on a long COVID forum speaks to the longsuffering experience of these patients not feeling heard or respected, and the hope of some ME/CFS patients to gain legitimacy through the publics growing recognition of long COVID.</p>
