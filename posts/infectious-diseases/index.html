A.\nScore: 247.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nImpact of sampling site on diagnostic test accuracy of RT-PCR in diagnosing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection since the emergence of omicron: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saal-Bauernschubert, L.; Wagner, C.; Fomenko, A.; Daehne, T.; Bora, A.-M.; Janka, H.; Stangl, S.; Skoetz, N.; Weibel, S.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296728\nNasopharyngeal sampling (NP) is the routine standard for SASR-CoV-2 detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this systematic review, we assessed diagnostic test accuracy of alternative sampling sites compared to NP for RT-PCR testing of Omicron (sub)-variants. We systematically searched for studies from January 2022 until February 2023 investigating any type of respiratory sample for RT-PCR in people with suspected, known, or known absence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE. We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low. Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.\nNo evidence that analgesic use after COVID-19 vaccination negatively impacts antibody responses\nAuthors: LaFleur, B.; White, L.; Dake, M. D.; Nikolich-Zugich, J.; Sprissler, R.; Bhattacharya, D.\nScore: 284.0, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.14.22281103\nUptake of mRNA vaccines, especially booster immunizations, against COVID-19 has been lower than hoped, perhaps in part due to their reactogenicity. Analgesics might alleviate symptoms associated with vaccination, but studies to measure their impact on immune responses have been limited to relatively small cohorts. We semi-quantitatively measured antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination in 2354 human participants surveyed about analgesic use. Participants who used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen after vaccination showed elevated antibody levels against the receptor binding domain of Spike protein relative to those who did not use analgesics. This pattern was observed for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and across age groups. Participants who used analgesics more frequently reported fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches than those who did not use painkillers. Amongst participants who reported these symptoms, we observed no statistically significant differences in antibody levels irrespective of analgesic use. These data suggest that antibody levels are elevated as a function of symptoms and inflammatory processes rather than painkiller use per se. Taken together, we find no evidence that analgesic use reduces antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendation of their use to alleviate symptoms might improve uptake of booster immunizations.\nSafety of SARS-CoV-2 test-to-stay in daycare: a regression discontinuity in time analysis\nAuthors: Dewald, F.; Steger, G.; Fish, I.; Torre-Lage, I.; Hellriegel, C.; Milz, E.; Kolb-Bastigkeit, A.; Heger, E.; Fries, M.; Buess, M.; Marizy, N.; Michaelis, B.; Suarez, I.; Quintanares, G. H.

This study aims to assess safety of a test-to-stay screening in daycare facilities. Methods714 daycare facilities and approximately 50,000 children [\u0026le;]6 years in Cologne, Germany participated in a SARS-CoV-2 Pool-PCR screening from March 2021 to April 2022. The screening initially comprised post-exposure quarantine and was adapted to a test-to-stay approach during its course. To assess safety of the test-to-stay approach, we explored potential changes in frequencies of infections among children following the adaptation to the test-to-stay approach by applying regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analyses. To this end, PCR-test data were linked with routinely collected data on reported infections in children and analyzed using ordinary least squares regressions. Results219,885 Pool-PCRs and 352,305 Single-PCRs were performed. 6,440 (2.93%) Pool-PCRs tested positive, and 17,208 infections in children were reported. We estimated that during a period of 30 weeks, the test-to-stay concept avoided between 7 and 20 days of quarantine per eligible daycare child. RDiT revealed a 26% reduction (Exp. Coef: 0.74, CI:0.52;1.06) in infection frequency among children and indicated no significant increase attributable to the test-to-stay approach. This result was not sensitive to adjustments for 7-day incidence, season, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and socioeconomic status. ConclusionOur analyses provide evidence that suggest safety of the test-to-stay approach compared to traditional quarantine measures. This approach offers a promising option to avoid use of quarantine after exposure to respiratory pathogens in daycare settings.\nReanalysis of cluster randomized trial data to account for exposure misclassification using a per-protocol and complier-restricted approach\nAuthors: Dufault, S. M.; Tanamas, S. K.; Indriani, C.; Ahmad, R. A.; Utarini, A.; Jewell, N. P.; Simmons, C. P.; Anders, K. L.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.20.23288835\nThe intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial estimated a protective efficacy of 77.1% for participants resident in areas randomised to receive releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, an emerging dengue preventive intervention. The limiting assumptions of ITT analyses in cluster randomised trials and the mobility of mosquitoes and humans across cluster boundaries indicate the primary analysis is likely to underestimate the full public health benefit. Using spatiotemporally-resolved data on the distribution of Wolbachia mosquitoes and on the mobility of AWED participants (n = 6,306), we perform complier-restricted and per-protocol re-examinations of the efficacy of the Wolbachia intervention. Increased intervention efficacy was estimated in all analyses by the refined exposure measures. The complier-restricted analysis returned an estimated efficacy of 80.7% (95% CI: 65.9, 89.0) and the per-protocol analysis estimated 82.7% (71.7, 88.4) efficacy when comparing participants with an estimated wMel exposure of[\u0026ge;] 80% compared to those with \u003c20%. These reanalyses demonstrate how human and mosquito movement can lead to underestimation of intervention effects in trials of vector interventions and indicate that the protective efficacy of Wolbachia is even higher than reported in the primary trial results.\nLong-term experience operating CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour in a K-5 elementary school using HEPA and MERV 16 Do-It-Yourself (DIY) portable air cleaners\nAuthors: Srikrishna, D.\nScore: 55.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.05.22281734\nOn May 12, 2023 CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour (5 ACH) and in July 2021 California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 ACH to reduce long-range, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens in classrooms. EPA recommends MERV 13+ DIY air cleaners for temporary use during wildfires, and a recent EPA study reported inconsistent usage in homes due to excessive noise generated by the DIY air cleaners. Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 MERV 16 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during two academic school years from spring 2021 through fall of 2023 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet 6 to 12 ACH. Teachers reported noise generated by MERV 16 DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 m (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5\" MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averaged 77% after six months (1st batch in February 2022) compared to 92% for newly installed filters (2nd batch in October 2022). Follow up testing on both batches of filters after an additional academic year (June 2023) showed only slight changes in average filtration efficiency. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for $200-$650 with DIY versus $600-$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. Based on this long-term experience, specific recommendations for enhancing and improving CDCs web page \"Ventilation in Buildings\" include: (1) recommended operation of MERV 13+ DIY at their low speed for low noise, cost-effective air cleaning (2) electro-mechanical safety especially in relation to power outlets (3) an open-source procedure known as the \"spike test\" using ambient aerosols to verify ACH in a room, like the Portacount for mask fit testing. Spike testing can become the basis for ACH certification or verification in any room without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers which may be unsafe or disallowed indoors).\nEvolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the RhineNeckar/Heidelberg Region 01/2021 07/2023\nAuthors: Bundschuh, C.; Weidner, N.; Klein, J.; Rausch, T.; Azevedo, N.; Telzerow, A.; Mallm, J.-P.; Kim, H.; Steiger, S.; Seufert, I.; Boerner, K.; Bauer, K.; Huebschmann, D.; Jost, K. L.; Parthe, S.; Schnitzler, P.; Boutros, M.; Rippe, K.; Mueller, B.; Bartenschlager, R.; Kraeusslich, H.-G.; Benes, V.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296928\nAt the beginning of 2021 the monitoring of the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 was established in Germany in accordance with the Corona Surveillance Act (discontinued after July 2023) to allow a better containment of the pandemic, because certain amino acid exchanges (especially) in the spike protein lead to higher transmission as well as a reduced vaccination efficacy. Therefore, our group performed whole genome sequencing applying the ARTIC protocol (currently V4) on Illuminas NextSeq 500 platform (and starting in May 2023 on the MiSeq DX platform) for SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen from patients of the Heidelberg University Hospital (and associated hospitals) as well as the Public health office in Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region. Our group sequenced a total of 26,795 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples between January 2021 and July 2023 - valid sequences, according to the requirements for sequence upload to the German electronic sequencing data hub (DESH) operated by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), could be determined for 24,852 samples, while the lineage/clade could be identified for 25,912 samples. While the year 2021 was very dynamic and changing regarding the circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region with the initial non-variant of concerns, followed by A.27.RN and the rise of B.1.1.7 in winter/spring and its displacement by B.1.617.2 in spring/summer, which remained almost exclusive until the beginning of December and the first B.1.1.529 incidences, which rose to a proportion of 40 percent by the end of 2021 (and superseded B.1.617.2 by January 2022 with a proportion of over 90 percent). The years 2022 and 2023 were then dominated by B.1.1.529 and its numerous sublineages, especially BA.5 and BA.2, and more recently by the rise of recombinant variants, such as XBB.1.5. By the end of July 2023 (and since calendar week 20) the proportion of the recombinant variants amounted to 100 percent of all circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region.\nComparative performance of COVID-19 test methods in healthcare workers during the omicron wave\nAuthors: Tornberg, E. C.; Tomlinson, A.; Oshiro, N. T. T.; Derfalie, E.; Curlin, M.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296099\nIntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents unique requirements for accessible, reliable testing, and many testing platforms and sampling techniques have been developed. However, not all test methods have been systematically compared to each other or a common gold standard, and the performance of tests developed in the early epidemic have not been consistently re-evaluated in the context of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. MethodsWe conducted a repeated measures study with adult healthcare workers presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants were tested using seven test modalities: PCR with samples from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and saliva; and BinaxNOW and iHealth antigen-based rapid detection tests (AgRDT) sampling the oropharynx and the nares. Test sensitivity was compared using any positive PCR test as the gold standard. Results325 individuals participated in the study. PCR tests were the most sensitive with saliva PCR at 0.957 {+/-} 0.048, nasopharyngeal PCR at 0.877 {+/-} 0.075, and oropharyngeal PCR at 0.849 {+/-} 0.082. Standard nasal rapid antigen tests were less sensitive but roughly equivalent at 0.613 {+/-} 0.110 for BinaxNOW brand and 0.627 {+/-} 0.109 for iHealth. Oropharyngeal rapid antigen tests were the least sensitive with BinaxNOW and iHealth brands at 0.400 {+/-} 0.111 and 0.311 {+/-} 0.105 respectively. ConclusionPCR remains the most sensitive testing modality for COVID-19, with saliva PCR being significantly more sensitive than oropharyngeal PCR and equivalent to nasopharyngeal PCR. Saliva testing has patient comfort and financial benefits, making it a preferred testing modality. Nasal AgRDTs are less sensitive than PCR though more accessible and convenient.\nSocioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake among children and adolescents in Catalonia, Spain\nAuthors: Lopez-Sanchez, I.; Perramon, A.; Soriano-Arandes, A.; Prats, C.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Raventos, B.; Roel, E.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297134\nIMPORTANCE The relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain. DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children. PARTICIPANTS Children (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data. EXPOSURE Deprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1. RESULTS Before COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.\nHigh prevalence and risk of malaria among asymptomatic individuals from villages with high rates of artemisinin partial resistance in Kyerwa district, North-western Tanzania.\nAuthors: Mandai, S.

This study assessed the prevalence and risk of malaria infections among asymptomatic individuals living in a hyperendemic area which has high prevalence of artemisinin partial resistant parasites in Kyerwa District of Kagera region, North-western Tanzania. MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional survey that recruited participants from five villages of Kyerwa district in Kagera region. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, parasitological, types of houses inhabited and socio-economic status (SES) data were collected using electronic capture tools running on Open Data Kit (ODK). Risk factors associated with malaria infections were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression and the results were presented as crude (cOR) and adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ResultsA total of 4,454 individuals were tested using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and 1,979 (44.4%) had a positive test. The prevalence of malaria varied from 14.4% to 68.5% with significant differences among the villages (p\u003c0.001). The prevalence and risk of malaria infections were significantly higher in males (aOR =1.25, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.48, p=0.04), school children ((aged 5 - 10 years, aOR =4.09, 95% CI: 3.39 - 5.10, p\u003c0.001) and (10-15 years, aOR=4.40, 95% CI: 3.46 - 5.59, p\u003c0.001)) and among individuals who were not using bed nets (aOR =1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.42, p=0.002). Other risks of malaria infections included lower SES (aOR=1.27, 95% CI:1.04 - 1.55, p\u003c0.001) and living in houses with open windows (aOR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.03 -1.54, p=0.024). ConclusionThis study showed high prevalence of malaria infections and high heterogeneity at micro-geographic levels. The risk of malaria infections was higher in school children, males, individuals who did not use bed nets, and among participants with low SES or living in poorly constructed houses. These findings provide important baseline data in an area with a high prevalence of artemisinin partial-resistant parasites and will be utilized in future studies to monitor the trends and potential spread of such parasites.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nasopharyngeal sampling (NP) is the routine standard for SASR-CoV-2 detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this systematic review, we assessed diagnostic test accuracy of alternative sampling sites compared to NP for RT-PCR testing of Omicron (sub)-variants.

We systematically searched for studies from January 2022 until February 2023 investigating any type of respiratory sample for RT-PCR in people with suspected, known, or known absence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE.

We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low.

Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Uptake of mRNA vaccines, especially booster immunizations, against COVID-19 has been lower than hoped, perhaps in part due to their reactogenicity. Analgesics might alleviate symptoms associated with vaccination, but studies to measure their impact on immune responses have been limited to relatively small cohorts. We semi-quantitatively measured antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination in 2354 human participants surveyed about analgesic use. Participants who used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen after vaccination showed elevated antibody levels against the receptor binding domain of Spike protein relative to those who did not use analgesics. This pattern was observed for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and across age groups. Participants who used analgesics more frequently reported fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches than those who did not use painkillers. Amongst participants who reported these symptoms, we observed no statistically significant differences in antibody levels irrespective of analgesic use. These data suggest that antibody levels are elevated as a function of symptoms and inflammatory processes rather than painkiller use per se. Taken together, we find no evidence that analgesic use reduces antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendation of their use to alleviate symptoms might improve uptake of booster immunizations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and ObjectivesTest-to-stay concepts apply serial testing of children in daycare after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 without use of quarantine. This study aims to assess safety of a test-to-stay screening in daycare facilities.

Methods714 daycare facilities and approximately 50,000 children [&amp;le;]6 years in Cologne, Germany participated in a SARS-CoV-2 Pool-PCR screening from March 2021 to April 2022. The screening initially comprised post-exposure quarantine and was adapted to a test-to-stay approach during its course. To assess safety of the test-to-stay approach, we explored potential changes in frequencies of infections among children following the adaptation to the test-to-stay approach by applying regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analyses. To this end, PCR-test data were linked with routinely collected data on reported infections in children and analyzed using ordinary least squares regressions.

Results219,885 Pool-PCRs and 352,305 Single-PCRs were performed. 6,440 (2.93%) Pool-PCRs tested positive, and 17,208 infections in children were reported. We estimated that during a period of 30 weeks, the test-to-stay concept avoided between 7 and 20 days of quarantine per eligible daycare child. RDiT revealed a 26% reduction (Exp. Coef: 0.74, CI:0.52;1.06) in infection frequency among children and indicated no significant increase attributable to the test-to-stay approach. This result was not sensitive to adjustments for 7-day incidence, season, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and socioeconomic status.

ConclusionOur analyses provide evidence that suggest safety of the test-to-stay approach compared to traditional quarantine measures. This approach offers a promising option to avoid use of quarantine after exposure to respiratory pathogens in daycare settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial estimated a protective efficacy of 77.1% for participants resident in areas randomised to receive releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, an emerging dengue preventive intervention. The limiting assumptions of ITT analyses in cluster randomised trials and the mobility of mosquitoes and humans across cluster boundaries indicate the primary analysis is likely to underestimate the full public health benefit. Using spatiotemporally-resolved data on the distribution of Wolbachia mosquitoes and on the mobility of AWED participants (n = 6,306), we perform complier-restricted and per-protocol re-examinations of the efficacy of the Wolbachia intervention. Increased intervention efficacy was estimated in all analyses by the refined exposure measures. The complier-restricted analysis returned an estimated efficacy of 80.7% (95% CI: 65.9, 89.0) and the per-protocol analysis estimated 82.7% (71.7, 88.4) efficacy when comparing participants with an estimated wMel exposure of[&amp;ge;] 80% compared to those with &lt;20%. These reanalyses demonstrate how human and mosquito movement can lead to underestimation of intervention effects in trials of vector interventions and indicate that the protective efficacy of Wolbachia is even higher than reported in the primary trial results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">On May 12, 2023 CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour (5 ACH) and in July 2021 California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 ACH to reduce long-range, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens in classrooms. EPA recommends MERV 13&#43; DIY air cleaners for temporary use during wildfires, and a recent EPA study reported inconsistent usage in homes due to excessive noise generated by the DIY air cleaners. Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 MERV 16 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during two academic school years from spring 2021 through fall of 2023 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet 6 to 12 ACH. Teachers reported noise generated by MERV 16 DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 m (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5&#34; MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averaged 77% after six months (1st batch in February 2022) compared to 92% for newly installed filters (2nd batch in October 2022). Follow up testing on both batches of filters after an additional academic year (June 2023) showed only slight changes in average filtration efficiency. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for $200-$650 with DIY versus $600-$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. Based on this long-term experience, specific recommendations for enhancing and improving CDCs web page &#34;Ventilation in Buildings&#34; include: (1) recommended operation of MERV 13&#43; DIY at their low speed for low noise, cost-effective air cleaning (2) electro-mechanical safety especially in relation to power outlets (3) an open-source procedure known as the &#34;spike test&#34; using ambient aerosols to verify ACH in a room, like the Portacount for mask fit testing. Spike testing can become the basis for ACH certification or verification in any room without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers which may be unsafe or disallowed indoors).</p>

        <p class="abstract">At the beginning of 2021 the monitoring of the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 was established in Germany in accordance with the Corona Surveillance Act (discontinued after July 2023) to allow a better containment of the pandemic, because certain amino acid exchanges (especially) in the spike protein lead to higher transmission as well as a reduced vaccination efficacy.

Therefore, our group performed whole genome sequencing applying the ARTIC protocol (currently V4) on Illuminas NextSeq 500 platform (and starting in May 2023 on the MiSeq DX platform) for SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen from patients of the Heidelberg University Hospital (and associated hospitals) as well as the Public health office in Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region.

Our group sequenced a total of 26,795 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples between January 2021 and July 2023 - valid sequences, according to the requirements for sequence upload to the German electronic sequencing data hub (DESH) operated by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), could be determined for 24,852 samples, while the lineage/clade could be identified for 25,912 samples.

While the year 2021 was very dynamic and changing regarding the circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region with the initial non-variant of concerns, followed by A.27.RN and the rise of B.1.1.7 in winter/spring and its displacement by B.1.617.2 in spring/summer, which remained almost exclusive until the beginning of December and the first B.1.1.529 incidences, which rose to a proportion of 40 percent by the end of 2021 (and superseded B.1.617.2 by January 2022 with a proportion of over 90 percent). The years 2022 and 2023 were then dominated by B.1.1.529 and its numerous sublineages, especially BA.5 and BA.2, and more recently by the rise of recombinant variants, such as XBB.1.5. By the end of July 2023 (and since calendar week 20) the proportion of the recombinant variants amounted to 100 percent of all circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents unique requirements for accessible, reliable testing, and many testing platforms and sampling techniques have been developed. However, not all test methods have been systematically compared to each other or a common gold standard, and the performance of tests developed in the early epidemic have not been consistently re-evaluated in the context of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

MethodsWe conducted a repeated measures study with adult healthcare workers presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants were tested using seven test modalities: PCR with samples from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and saliva; and BinaxNOW and iHealth antigen-based rapid detection tests (AgRDT) sampling the oropharynx and the nares. Test sensitivity was compared using any positive PCR test as the gold standard.

Results325 individuals participated in the study. PCR tests were the most sensitive with saliva PCR at 0.957 {&#43;/-} 0.048, nasopharyngeal PCR at 0.877 {&#43;/-} 0.075, and oropharyngeal PCR at 0.849 {&#43;/-} 0.082. Standard nasal rapid antigen tests were less sensitive but roughly equivalent at 0.613 {&#43;/-} 0.110 for BinaxNOW brand and 0.627 {&#43;/-} 0.109 for iHealth. Oropharyngeal rapid antigen tests were the least sensitive with BinaxNOW and iHealth brands at 0.400 {&#43;/-} 0.111 and 0.311 {&#43;/-} 0.105 respectively.

ConclusionPCR remains the most sensitive testing modality for COVID-19, with saliva PCR being significantly more sensitive than oropharyngeal PCR and equivalent to nasopharyngeal PCR. Saliva testing has patient comfort and financial benefits, making it a preferred testing modality. Nasal AgRDTs are less sensitive than PCR though more accessible and convenient.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IMPORTANCE The relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain. DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children. PARTICIPANTS Children (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data. EXPOSURE Deprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1. RESULTS Before COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTanzania adopted and has been implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended interventions to control and eventually eliminate malaria. However, malaria is still a leading public health problem and the country experiences heterogeneous transmission; but the drivers of these patterns are not clearly known. This study assessed the prevalence and risk of malaria infections among asymptomatic individuals living in a hyperendemic area which has high prevalence of artemisinin partial resistant parasites in Kyerwa District of Kagera region, North-western Tanzania.

MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional survey that recruited participants from five villages of Kyerwa district in Kagera region. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, parasitological, types of houses inhabited and socio-economic status (SES) data were collected using electronic capture tools running on Open Data Kit (ODK). Risk factors associated with malaria infections were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression and the results were presented as crude (cOR) and adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

ResultsA total of 4,454 individuals were tested using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and 1,979 (44.4%) had a positive test. The prevalence of malaria varied from 14.4% to 68.5% with significant differences among the villages (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence and risk of malaria infections were significantly higher in males (aOR =1.25, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.48, p=0.04), school children ((aged 5 - 10 years, aOR =4.09, 95% CI: 3.39 - 5.10, p&lt;0.001) and (10-15 years, aOR=4.40, 95% CI: 3.46 - 5.59, p&lt;0.001)) and among individuals who were not using bed nets (aOR =1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.42, p=0.002). Other risks of malaria infections included lower SES (aOR=1.27, 95% CI:1.04 - 1.55, p&lt;0.001) and living in houses with open windows (aOR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.03 -1.54, p=0.024).

ConclusionThis study showed high prevalence of malaria infections and high heterogeneity at micro-geographic levels. The risk of malaria infections was higher in school children, males, individuals who did not use bed nets, and among participants with low SES or living in poorly constructed houses. These findings provide important baseline data in an area with a high prevalence of artemisinin partial-resistant parasites and will be utilized in future studies to monitor the trends and potential spread of such parasites.</p>
