S.; Parekh, A.; Gorinson, D.; Cai, R.; Mahato, S.; Ramanathan, P.; Aurelia, L. C.; John Selva, K.; Marchese, A. M.; Fries, L.; Chung, A. W.; Dunkle, L. M.\nScore: 480.8, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301374\nRepeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.\nPredicting COVID-19 booster immunogenicity against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and the benefits of vaccine updates\nAuthors: Cromer, D.; Reynaldi, A.; Hie, A.; Schlub, T. E.; Juno, J. A.; Wheatley, A. K.; Kent, S. J.; Khoury, D. S.; Davenport, M. P.\nScore: 48.7, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.24302032\nThe ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a move to update vaccine antigens in 2022 and 2023. These updated antigens were chosen and approved based on in vitro neutralisation titres against recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, unavoidable delays in viral manufacture and distribution meant that the updated booster vaccine was no longer well matched to the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant by the time of its deployment. Understanding whether the updating of booster vaccine antigens improves immune responses to subsequent SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants is a major priority in justifying future vaccine updates. Here we analyse all available data on the immunogenicity of variant containing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their ability to neutralise later circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that updated booster antigens give a 1.4-fold [95%CI 1.07-1.82] greater increase in neutralising antibody levels when compared with a historical vaccine immunogen. We then use this to predict the relative protection that can be expected from an updated vaccine even when the circulating variant has evolved away from the updated vaccine immunogen. These findings help inform the roll out of future booster vaccination programs.\nImmune activation and immune-associated neurotoxicity in Long-COVID: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 82 studies comprising 58 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors.\nAuthors: Almulla, A. F.; Thipakorn, Y.; Zhou, B.; Vojdani, A.; Maes, M.\nScore: 30.0, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.24302516\nBackground: Multiple studies have shown that Long COVID (LC) disease is associated with heightened immune activation, as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators. However, there is no comprehensive meta-analysis focusing on activation of the immune inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immunoregulatory system (CIRS) along with other immune phenotypes in LC patients. Objectives: This meta-analysis is designed to explore the IRS and CIRS profiles in LC patients, the individual cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, along with C-reactive protein (CRP) and immune-associated neurotoxicity. Methods: To gather relevant studies for our research, we conducted a thorough search using databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciFinder, covering all available literature up to December 20th, 2023. Results: The current meta-analysis encompassed 82 studies that examined multiple immune profiles, C-reactive protein, and 58 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in 3836 LC patients versus 4537 normal controls (NC). LC patients showed significant increases in IRS/CIRS ratio (standardized mean difference (SMD:0.156, confidence interval (CI): 0.051;0.261), IRS (SMD: 0.345, CI: 0.222;0.468), M1 macrophage (SMD: 0.421, CI: 0.290;0.551), T helper (Th)1 (SMD: 0.353, CI: 0.189;0.517), Th17 (SMD: 0.492, CI: 0.332;0.651) and immune-associated neurotoxicity (SMD: 0.327 CI: 0.205;0.448). In addition, CRP and 19 different cytokines displayed significantly elevated levels in LC patients compared to NC. Conclusion: LC disease is characterized by IRS activation and increased immune-associated neurotoxicity.\nBlood transcriptomics reveal persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA and candidate biomarkers in Long COVID patients\nAuthors: MENEZES, S. M.; JAMOULLE, M.; Carletto, M. P.; Van Holm, B.; Moens, L.; Meyts, I.; Maes, P.; Van Weyenbergh, J.\nScore: 355.1, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301293\nWith an estimated 65 million individuals suffering from Long COVID, validated therapeutic strategies as well as non-invasive biomarkers are direly needed to guide clinical management. We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.\nPossible roles of phytochemicals with bioactive properties in the prevention of and recovery from COVID-19\nAuthors: Koyama, S.; Shields, V. D.; Heinbockel, T.; Joseph, P. V.; Adhikari, P.; Kaur, R.; Kumar, R.; Alizadeh, R.; Bhutani, S.; Calcinoni, O.; Mucignat-Caretta, C.; Chen, J.; Cooper, K. W.; Das, S.; Dominguez, P. R.; Guardia, M. D.; Klyuchnikova, M. A.; Laktionova, T. K.; MOri, E.; Namjoo, Z.; Nguyen, H.; Ozdener, M. H.; Parsa, S.; Poyraz, E. O.; Strub, D. J.; Taghizadeh-Hesary, F.; Ueha, R.; Voznessenskaya, V. V.\nScore: 77.4, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301882\nPurposeThere have been large geographical differences in the infection and death rates of COVID-19. Foods and beverages containing high amounts of phytochemicals with bioactive properties were suggested to prevent contracting, to limit the severity of, and to facilitate recovery from COVID-19. The goal of our study was to determine the correlation of the type of foods/beverages people consumed and the risk reduction of contracting COVID-19 and the recovery from COVID-19. MethodsWe developed an online survey that asked the participants whether they contracted COVID-19, their symptoms, time to recover, and their frequency of eating various types of foods/beverages. The survey was first developed in English and then translated into 10 different languages. ResultsThe participants who did not contract COVID-19 consumed vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages significantly more than the participants who contracted COVID-19 and those who were not tested but became sick most likely from COVID-19. The geographic location of participants corresponded with the language of the survey, except for the English version, thus, nine out of the 10 language versions represented a country. Among the six countries (India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain) with over one hundred participants, we found that in India and Japan the people who contracted COVID-19 showed significantly shorter recovery time, and greater daily intake of vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages was associated with faster recovery. ConclusionOur results suggest that phytochemical compounds included in the vegetables may have contributed in not only preventing contraction of COVID-19, but also accelerating their recovery.

F.; Lezcano-Coba, C.; Galue, J.; Rodriguez, X.; Juarez, Y.; de Souza, W. M.; Capitan-Barrios, Z.; Valderrama, A.; Abrego, L.; Cedeno, H.; Jackman, C.; Waggoner, J.; Aguilar, P. V.; Guzman, H.; Weaver, S.; Tesh, R. B.; Lopez-Verges, S. L.; Donnelly, C. A.; Estofolete, C. F.; Faria, N. R.; Vasilakis, N.; Vittor, A. Y.; Smith, D. R.; Carrera, J.-P.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302220\nMadariaga virus (MADV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are emerging arboviruses affecting rural and remote areas of Latin America. However, there are limited clinical and epidemiological reports available, and outbreaks are occurring at an increasing frequency. We addressed this gap by analyzing all the available clinical and epidemiological data of MADV and VEEV infections recorded since 1961 in Panama. A total of 168 of human alphavirus encephalitis cases were detected in Panama from 1961 to 2023. Here we describe the clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological characteristics of these cases, and also explored signs and symptoms as potential predictors of encephalitic alphavirus infection when compared to those of other arbovirus infections occurring in the region. Our results highlight the challenges clinical diagnosis of alphavirus disease in endemic regions with overlapping circulation of multiple arboviruses.\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Household Transmission during the Omicron Era in Massachusetts: A Prospective, Case-Ascertained Study using Genomic Epidemiology\nAuthors: Banga, J.; Brock-Fisher, T.; Petros, B. A.; Dai, E. Y.; Leonelli, A. T.; Dobbins, S. T.; Messer, K. S.; Nathanson, A. B.; Capone, A. A.; Littlehale, N. A.; Appiah-Danquah, V.; Dim, S.; Moreno, G. K.; Crowther, M.; Lee, K. A.; DeRuff, K. C.; MacInnis, B. L.; Springer, M.; Sabeti, P. C.; Stephenson, K. E.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.24302348\nBackgroundHouseholds are a major setting for SARS-CoV-2 infections, but there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the dynamics of viral transmission, particularly in the setting of widespread pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity and evolving variants. MethodsWe conducted a prospective, case-ascertained household transmission study in the greater Boston area in March-July 2022. Anterior nasal swabs, along with clinical and demographic data, were collected for 14 days. Nasal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Whole genome sequencing was performed on high-titer samples. ResultsWe enrolled 33 households in a primary analysis set, with a median age of participants of 25 years old (range 2-66); 98% of whom had received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. 58% of households had a secondary case during follow up and the secondary attack rate (SAR) for contacts infected was 39%. We further examined a strict analysis set of 21 households that had only 1 PCR+ case at baseline, finding an SAR of 22.5%. Genomic epidemiology further determined that there were multiple sources of infection for household contacts, including the index case and outside introductions. When limiting estimates to only highly probable transmissions given epidemiologic and genomic data, the SAR was 18.4%. ConclusionsHousehold contacts of a person newly diagnosed with COVID-19 are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 weeks. This is, however, not only due to infection from the household index case, but also because the presence of an infected household member implies increased SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Further studies to understand and mitigate household transmission are needed. Key PointsWhen community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high, distinguishing household transmissions from independent introductions is difficult with either epidemiologic or genomic data alone. Here, we conducted daily nasal sampling with genomic sequencing to understand the dynamics of viral transmission within households.\nPlasma proteomic evidence for increased Alzheimer's disease-related brain pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Duff, E. P.; Zetterberg, H.; Heslegrave, A.; Dehghan, A.; Elliott, P.; Allen, N.; Runz, H.; Laban, R.; Veleva, E.; Whelan, C. D.; Sun, B. B.; Matthews, P. M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302132\nViral infections have been linked to an increased risk for dementia. We investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases preclinical brain pathology associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) by comparing changes in plasma biomarkers in UK Biobank participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discovered an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced plasma A{beta}42:A{beta}40 concentration ratio. In older participants, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with both lower plasma A{beta}42 and higher plasma pTau-181. These biomarker changes, which have been associated with beta-amyloid accumulation and prodromal AD, were associated with increased brain imaging signatures of AD, poorer cognitive scores, and worse assessments of overall health and appeared to be greater in participants who had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Protein biomarker risk scores for other diseases were also raised among individuals who had past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that viral infections can accelerate prodromal AD pathology and highlight biomarker profiles indicative of an increased risk of dementia and systemic diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in older people.\nIncreased pediatric RSV case counts following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 are attributable to increased testing\nAuthors: Petros, B. A.; Milliren, C. E.; Sabeti, P. C.; Ozonoff, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.24302387\nBackgroundThe incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) dropped markedly early in the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a resurgence with heightened case counts. The \"immunity debt\" hypothesis proposes that the RSV-naive pediatric population increased during the period of low transmission, resulting in a subsequent increased risk of infection. However, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited, and no studies have comprehensively evaluated the role of changing respiratory viral testing practices in the perceived surge. MethodsWe conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 342,530 RSV encounters and 980,546 RSV diagnostic tests occurring at 32 United States pediatric hospitals between 2013 and 2023. We used interrupted time series analysis to estimate pandemic-associated changes in RSV patient and testing volume, and to quantify changes in the proportions of patients admitted from the emergency department (ED), admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and receiving mechanical ventilation. We quantified the fraction of the observed shifts in case counts and in the age of diagnosed patients attributable to changes in RSV testing practices. Finally, we analyzed 524,404 influenza virus encounters and 1,768,526 influenza diagnostic tests to address the specificity of the findings to RSV. FindingsRSV patient volume increased 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.7, 3.5) in 2021-2023 relative to the pre-pandemic phase, and was accompanied by an 18.9-fold increase (95% CI: 15.0, 23.9) in RSV test volume. Over two-thirds of the apparent shifts in patient volume and in patient age were attributable to increased testing, which was concentrated among older pediatric patients. The proportions of patients with RSV requiring hospitalization, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation declined significantly across all patient age groups. These declines were not observed for patients with influenza virus. InterpretationA surge in RSV testing, rather than in viral circulation, likely underlies the increased case counts observed in 2021-2023. We identify expected consequences of increased testing, including the diagnosis of less severe cases and a shift in the patient age distribution. These findings warrant a critical assessment of the immunity debt hypothesis, while highlighting the importance of considering the testing denominator when surveillance strategies are dynamic. FundingNational Institutes of Health \u0026 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGoogle Scholar was used to identify studies describing the epidemiology or clinical severity of RSV after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. On 2 February 2024, a search was conducted for articles published since 2021 whose titles contain the term \"respiratory syncytial virus\" as well as one or more of the following terms: \"clinical\", \"COVID-19\", \"debt\", \"epidemiology\", \"immunity\", \"severity\", or \"outcome.\" Prior to the study, it was clear that RSV circulation was limited during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that its return was documented as large, off-season epidemics. An increase in the age of pediatric patients diagnosed with RSV has also been well characterized. Multiple studies include discussions of an RSV immunity debt as the cause of elevated case counts, though no studies have provided causal evidence that a decline in population immunity underlies the large epidemics. Moreover, no studies have examined the role of shifting respiratory viral testing practices in epidemic sizes. Added value of this studyHere, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the role of increased diagnostic testing in the incidence of RSV before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that testing for RSV increased nearly 20-fold, and that the majority of the increase in patient volume can be attributed to increased testing, primarily of older children. Implications of all the available evidenceChanging diagnostic testing practices can explain the bulk of the increased detection of RSV over multiple annual epidemics following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Additional factors, including increased tendency to seek healthcare and a decline in population-level immunity to RSV may be a role in the observed dynamics.\nHeterogeneity of Diagnosis and Documentation of Post-COVID Conditions in Primary Care: A Machine Learning Analysis\nAuthors: Hendrix, N.; Parikh, R. V.; Taskier, M.; Walter, G.; Rochlin, I.; Saydeh, S.; Koumans, E. H.; Rincon-Guevara, O.; Rehkopf, D. H.; Phillips, R. L.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.24302451\nBackgroundPost-COVID conditions (PCC) present clinicians with significant challenges due to their variable presentation. ObjectiveTo characterize patterns of PCC diagnosis in generalist primary care settings. DesignRetrospective observational study Setting519 primary care clinics around the United States who were in the American Family Cohort registry between October 1, 2021 and November 1, 2023. Patients6,116 with diagnostic code for PCC; 5,020 with PCC and COVID-19 MeasurementsTime between COVID-19 and PCC (U09.9) diagnostic codes; count of patients with PCC diagnostic codes per clinician; patient-specific probability of PCC diagnostic code estimated by a tree-based machine learning model trained on clinician and specific practice visited, patient demographics, and other diagnoses; performance of a natural language classifier trained on notes from 5,000 patients annotated by two physicians to indicate probable PCC. ResultsOf patients with diagnostic codes for PCC and COVID-19, 43.0% were diagnosed with PCC less than 4 weeks after initial recorded COVID-19 diagnostic code. Six clinicians (out of 3,845 total) made 15.4% of all PCC diagnoses. The high-performing (F1: 0.98) tree-based model showed that patient demographics, practice visited, clinician visited, and calendar date of visit were more predictive of PCC diagnostic code than any symptom. Inter-rater agreement on PCC diagnosis was moderate (Cohens kappa: 0.60), and performance of the natural language classifiers was poor (best F1: 0.54). LimitationsCannot validate date of COVID-19 diagnosis, as it may not reflect when disease began and could have been coded retrospectively. Few options for medically focused language models. ConclusionWe identified multiple sources of heterogeneity in the documentation of PCC diagnostic codes in primary care practices after introduction of ICD-10 codes for PCC, which has created challenges for public health surveillance.

        <p class="abstract">Repeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a move to update vaccine antigens in 2022 and 2023. These updated antigens were chosen and approved based on in vitro neutralisation titres against recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, unavoidable delays in viral manufacture and distribution meant that the updated booster vaccine was no longer well matched to the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant by the time of its deployment. Understanding whether the updating of booster vaccine antigens improves immune responses to subsequent SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants is a major priority in justifying future vaccine updates. Here we analyse all available data on the immunogenicity of variant containing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their ability to neutralise later circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that updated booster antigens give a 1.4-fold [95%CI 1.07-1.82] greater increase in neutralising antibody levels when compared with a historical vaccine immunogen. We then use this to predict the relative protection that can be expected from an updated vaccine even when the circulating variant has evolved away from the updated vaccine immunogen. These findings help inform the roll out of future booster vaccination programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Multiple studies have shown that Long COVID (LC) disease is associated with heightened immune activation, as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators. However, there is no comprehensive meta-analysis focusing on activation of the immune inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immunoregulatory system (CIRS) along with other immune phenotypes in LC patients. Objectives: This meta-analysis is designed to explore the IRS and CIRS profiles in LC patients, the individual cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, along with C-reactive protein (CRP) and immune-associated neurotoxicity. Methods: To gather relevant studies for our research, we conducted a thorough search using databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciFinder, covering all available literature up to December 20th, 2023. Results: The current meta-analysis encompassed 82 studies that examined multiple immune profiles, C-reactive protein, and 58 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in 3836 LC patients versus 4537 normal controls (NC). LC patients showed significant increases in IRS/CIRS ratio (standardized mean difference (SMD:0.156, confidence interval (CI): 0.051;0.261), IRS (SMD: 0.345, CI: 0.222;0.468), M1 macrophage (SMD: 0.421, CI: 0.290;0.551), T helper (Th)1 (SMD: 0.353, CI: 0.189;0.517), Th17 (SMD: 0.492, CI: 0.332;0.651) and immune-associated neurotoxicity (SMD: 0.327 CI: 0.205;0.448). In addition, CRP and 19 different cytokines displayed significantly elevated levels in LC patients compared to NC. Conclusion: LC disease is characterized by IRS activation and increased immune-associated neurotoxicity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With an estimated 65 million individuals suffering from Long COVID, validated therapeutic strategies as well as non-invasive biomarkers are direly needed to guide clinical management. We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThere have been large geographical differences in the infection and death rates of COVID-19. Foods and beverages containing high amounts of phytochemicals with bioactive properties were suggested to prevent contracting, to limit the severity of, and to facilitate recovery from COVID-19. The goal of our study was to determine the correlation of the type of foods/beverages people consumed and the risk reduction of contracting COVID-19 and the recovery from COVID-19.

MethodsWe developed an online survey that asked the participants whether they contracted COVID-19, their symptoms, time to recover, and their frequency of eating various types of foods/beverages. The survey was first developed in English and then translated into 10 different languages.

ResultsThe participants who did not contract COVID-19 consumed vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages significantly more than the participants who contracted COVID-19 and those who were not tested but became sick most likely from COVID-19. The geographic location of participants corresponded with the language of the survey, except for the English version, thus, nine out of the 10 language versions represented a country. Among the six countries (India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain) with over one hundred participants, we found that in India and Japan the people who contracted COVID-19 showed significantly shorter recovery time, and greater daily intake of vegetables, herbs/spices, and fermented foods/beverages was associated with faster recovery.

ConclusionOur results suggest that phytochemical compounds included in the vegetables may have contributed in not only preventing contraction of COVID-19, but also accelerating their recovery. (249 words; EJN limit is 250 words)</p>

        <p class="abstract">Madariaga virus (MADV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are emerging arboviruses affecting rural and remote areas of Latin America. However, there are limited clinical and epidemiological reports available, and outbreaks are occurring at an increasing frequency. We addressed this gap by analyzing all the available clinical and epidemiological data of MADV and VEEV infections recorded since 1961 in Panama. A total of 168 of human alphavirus encephalitis cases were detected in Panama from 1961 to 2023. Here we describe the clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological characteristics of these cases, and also explored signs and symptoms as potential predictors of encephalitic alphavirus infection when compared to those of other arbovirus infections occurring in the region. Our results highlight the challenges clinical diagnosis of alphavirus disease in endemic regions with overlapping circulation of multiple arboviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHouseholds are a major setting for SARS-CoV-2 infections, but there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the dynamics of viral transmission, particularly in the setting of widespread pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity and evolving variants.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective, case-ascertained household transmission study in the greater Boston area in March-July 2022. Anterior nasal swabs, along with clinical and demographic data, were collected for 14 days. Nasal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Whole genome sequencing was performed on high-titer samples.

ResultsWe enrolled 33 households in a primary analysis set, with a median age of participants of 25 years old (range 2-66); 98% of whom had received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. 58% of households had a secondary case during follow up and the secondary attack rate (SAR) for contacts infected was 39%. We further examined a strict analysis set of 21 households that had only 1 PCR&#43; case at baseline, finding an SAR of 22.5%. Genomic epidemiology further determined that there were multiple sources of infection for household contacts, including the index case and outside introductions. When limiting estimates to only highly probable transmissions given epidemiologic and genomic data, the SAR was 18.4%.

ConclusionsHousehold contacts of a person newly diagnosed with COVID-19 are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 weeks. This is, however, not only due to infection from the household index case, but also because the presence of an infected household member implies increased SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Further studies to understand and mitigate household transmission are needed.

Key PointsWhen community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high, distinguishing household transmissions from independent introductions is difficult with either epidemiologic or genomic data alone. Here, we conducted daily nasal sampling with genomic sequencing to understand the dynamics of viral transmission within households.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viral infections have been linked to an increased risk for dementia. We investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases preclinical brain pathology associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) by comparing changes in plasma biomarkers in UK Biobank participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discovered an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced plasma A{beta}42:A{beta}40 concentration ratio. In older participants, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with both lower plasma A{beta}42 and higher plasma pTau-181. These biomarker changes, which have been associated with beta-amyloid accumulation and prodromal AD, were associated with increased brain imaging signatures of AD, poorer cognitive scores, and worse assessments of overall health and appeared to be greater in participants who had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Protein biomarker risk scores for other diseases were also raised among individuals who had past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that viral infections can accelerate prodromal AD pathology and highlight biomarker profiles indicative of an increased risk of dementia and systemic diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in older people.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) dropped markedly early in the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a resurgence with heightened case counts. The &#34;immunity debt&#34; hypothesis proposes that the RSV-naive pediatric population increased during the period of low transmission, resulting in a subsequent increased risk of infection. However, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited, and no studies have comprehensively evaluated the role of changing respiratory viral testing practices in the perceived surge.

MethodsWe conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 342,530 RSV encounters and 980,546 RSV diagnostic tests occurring at 32 United States pediatric hospitals between 2013 and 2023. We used interrupted time series analysis to estimate pandemic-associated changes in RSV patient and testing volume, and to quantify changes in the proportions of patients admitted from the emergency department (ED), admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and receiving mechanical ventilation. We quantified the fraction of the observed shifts in case counts and in the age of diagnosed patients attributable to changes in RSV testing practices. Finally, we analyzed 524,404 influenza virus encounters and 1,768,526 influenza diagnostic tests to address the specificity of the findings to RSV.

FindingsRSV patient volume increased 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.7, 3.5) in 2021-2023 relative to the pre-pandemic phase, and was accompanied by an 18.9-fold increase (95% CI: 15.0, 23.9) in RSV test volume. Over two-thirds of the apparent shifts in patient volume and in patient age were attributable to increased testing, which was concentrated among older pediatric patients. The proportions of patients with RSV requiring hospitalization, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation declined significantly across all patient age groups. These declines were not observed for patients with influenza virus.

InterpretationA surge in RSV testing, rather than in viral circulation, likely underlies the increased case counts observed in 2021-2023. We identify expected consequences of increased testing, including the diagnosis of less severe cases and a shift in the patient age distribution. These findings warrant a critical assessment of the immunity debt hypothesis, while highlighting the importance of considering the testing denominator when surveillance strategies are dynamic.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGoogle Scholar was used to identify studies describing the epidemiology or clinical severity of RSV after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. On 2 February 2024, a search was conducted for articles published since 2021 whose titles contain the term &#34;respiratory syncytial virus&#34; as well as one or more of the following terms: &#34;clinical&#34;, &#34;COVID-19&#34;, &#34;debt&#34;, &#34;epidemiology&#34;, &#34;immunity&#34;, &#34;severity&#34;, or &#34;outcome.&#34; Prior to the study, it was clear that RSV circulation was limited during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that its return was documented as large, off-season epidemics. An increase in the age of pediatric patients diagnosed with RSV has also been well characterized. Multiple studies include discussions of an RSV immunity debt as the cause of elevated case counts, though no studies have provided causal evidence that a decline in population immunity underlies the large epidemics. Moreover, no studies have examined the role of shifting respiratory viral testing practices in epidemic sizes.

Added value of this studyHere, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the role of increased diagnostic testing in the incidence of RSV before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that testing for RSV increased nearly 20-fold, and that the majority of the increase in patient volume can be attributed to increased testing, primarily of older children.

Implications of all the available evidenceChanging diagnostic testing practices can explain the bulk of the increased detection of RSV over multiple annual epidemics following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Additional factors, including increased tendency to seek healthcare and a decline in population-level immunity to RSV may be a role in the observed dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-COVID conditions (PCC) present clinicians with significant challenges due to their variable presentation.

ObjectiveTo characterize patterns of PCC diagnosis in generalist primary care settings.

DesignRetrospective observational study

Setting519 primary care clinics around the United States who were in the American Family Cohort registry between October 1, 2021 and November 1, 2023.

Patients6,116 with diagnostic code for PCC; 5,020 with PCC and COVID-19

MeasurementsTime between COVID-19 and PCC (U09.9) diagnostic codes; count of patients with PCC diagnostic codes per clinician; patient-specific probability of PCC diagnostic code estimated by a tree-based machine learning model trained on clinician and specific practice visited, patient demographics, and other diagnoses; performance of a natural language classifier trained on notes from 5,000 patients annotated by two physicians to indicate probable PCC.

ResultsOf patients with diagnostic codes for PCC and COVID-19, 43.0% were diagnosed with PCC less than 4 weeks after initial recorded COVID-19 diagnostic code. Six clinicians (out of 3,845 total) made 15.4% of all PCC diagnoses. The high-performing (F1: 0.98) tree-based model showed that patient demographics, practice visited, clinician visited, and calendar date of visit were more predictive of PCC diagnostic code than any symptom. Inter-rater agreement on PCC diagnosis was moderate (Cohens kappa: 0.60), and performance of the natural language classifiers was poor (best F1: 0.54).

LimitationsCannot validate date of COVID-19 diagnosis, as it may not reflect when disease began and could have been coded retrospectively. Few options for medically focused language models.

ConclusionWe identified multiple sources of heterogeneity in the documentation of PCC diagnostic codes in primary care practices after introduction of ICD-10 codes for PCC, which has created challenges for public health surveillance.
