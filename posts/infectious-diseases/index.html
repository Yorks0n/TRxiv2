M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 218.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nNo evidence that analgesic use after COVID-19 vaccination negatively impacts antibody responses\nAuthors: LaFleur, B.; White, L.; Dake, M. D.; Nikolich-Zugich, J.; Sprissler, R.; Bhattacharya, D.\nScore: 283.3, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.14.22281103\nUptake of mRNA vaccines, especially booster immunizations, against COVID-19 has been lower than hoped, perhaps in part due to their reactogenicity. Analgesics might alleviate symptoms associated with vaccination, but studies to measure their impact on immune responses have been limited to relatively small cohorts. We semi-quantitatively measured antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination in 2354 participants surveyed about analgesic use. Participants who used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen after vaccination showed elevated antibody levels against the receptor binding domain of Spike protein relative to those who did not use analgesics. This pattern was observed for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and across age groups. Participants who used analgesics more frequently reported fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches than those who did not use painkillers. Amongst participants who reported these symptoms, we observed no statistically significant differences in antibody levels irrespective of analgesic use. These data suggest that antibody levels are elevated as a function of symptoms and inflammatory processes rather than painkiller use per se. Taken together, we find no evidence that analgesic use reduces antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendation of their use to alleviate symptoms might improve uptake of booster immunizations.\nHumoral and cellular immune responses following BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccination\nAuthors: Stankov, M. V.; Hoffmann, M.; Gutierrez, R.; Cossmann, A.; Morillas Ramos, G.; Graalmann, T.; Friedrichsen, M.; Ravens, I.; Tamara, I.; Ristenpart, J.; Schimrock, A.; Willenzon, S.; Ahrenstorff, G.; Witte, T.; Foerster, R.; Kempf, A.; Poehlmann, S.; Hammerschmidt, S. I.; Dopfer-Jablonka, A.; Behrens, G. M.\nScore: 91.1, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296545\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants efficiently evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, requiring vaccine adaptation. Here, we analyzed immunogenicity of an adapted vaccine, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5, which is currently used for booster vaccination. Booster vaccination significantly increased anti-Spike IgG, accompanied by expansion of cross-reactive memory B cells recognizing Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 spike variants. Geometric mean neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3, as well as cross-reactive responses against EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 increased significantly relative to pre-booster titers. Finally, the number of Wuhan and XBB.1.5 spike reactive IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells significantly increased after booster vaccination. In summary, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccination resulted in potent neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron XBB variants, including the recent Omicron variants EG.5.1 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), as well as XBB.1.5 reactive T cell responses, suggesting that booster vaccination will augment protection against these emerging variants.\nImpact of sampling site on diagnostic test accuracy of RT-PCR in diagnosing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection since the emergence of omicron: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saal-Bauernschubert, L.; Wagner, C.; Fomenko, A.; Daehne, T.; Bora, A.-M.; Janka, H.; Stangl, S.; Skoetz, N.; Weibel, S.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296728\nNasopharyngeal sampling (NP) is the routine standard for SASR-CoV-2 detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this systematic review, we assessed diagnostic test accuracy of alternative sampling sites compared to NP for RT-PCR testing of Omicron (sub)-variants. We systematically searched for studies from January 2022 until February 2023 investigating any type of respiratory sample for RT-PCR in people with suspected, known, or known absence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE. We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low. Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.\nKnowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Related to Avian Influenza (H5N1) After the Outbreak in Rural, Cambodia\nAuthors: Vang, D.; Chau, D.; Vutha, K.; Um, S.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296059\nFrom 2003 to 25 February 2023, the avian influenza (H5N1) virus was confirmed in 59 human infections, including 39 deaths ([~]66% case-fatality rate) reported in 13 of 25 provinces in Cambodia. We aimed to assess current knowledge, attitude, and practice toward changes in poultry handling behaviors, poultry consumption, and poultry mortality reporting among rural villagers in areas affected by Avian influenza (H5N1) in Cambodia. A cross-section survey was conducted in August 2023. There were 208 participants residing in Prey Veng province who were invited to be interviewed face-to-face. Descriptive statistics were performed using STATA V17. The participants average age was 55 years old (SD=13.3 years), 78.4% were female, 59% had completed primary school, 56.7% were farmers, 68.3% raised chickens in their backyards, and 10.2% raised ducks, 23% of participants cooked sick or dead birds for their families, 32% knowing information about avian influenza virus was a lower proportion from healthcare providers, 10.6% from village health support groups were, and 2% from village animal health workers were only, 49% have been reported poultry illness and deaths to local authorities. The avian influenza epidemic in Cambodia is a genuine threat to animals and a possible concern to humans. To prevent and control this, we strongly advise everyone who works with poultry or wild game birds always to be prepared to follow appropriate hygiene standards and to cook poultry meat properly.\nSafety of SARS-CoV-2 test-to-stay in daycare: a regression discontinuity in time analysis\nAuthors: Dewald, F.; Steger, G.; Fish, I.; Torre-Lage, I.; Hellriegel, C.; Milz, E.; Kolb-Bastigkeit, A.; Heger, E.; Fries, M.; Buess, M.; Marizy, N.; Michaelis, B.; Suarez, I.; Quintanares, G. H. R.; Pirkl, M.; Aigner, A.; Obserste-Frielinghaus, M.; Hellmich, M.; Wong, A.; Camilo Orduz, J.; Faetkenheuer, G.; Doetsch, J.; Kossow, A.; Moench, E.-M.; Quade, G.; Neumann, U.; Kaiser, R.; Schranz, M.; Klein, F.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296808\nBackground and Objectives Test-to-stay concepts apply serial testing of children in daycare after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 without use of quarantine. This study aims to assess safety of a test-to-stay screening in daycare facilities. Methods 714 daycare facilities and approximately 50,000 children [\u0026le;]6 years in Cologne, Germany participated in a SARS-CoV-2 Pool-PCR screening from March 2021 to April 2022. The screening initially comprised post-exposure quarantine and was adapted to a test-to-stay approach during its course. To assess safety of the test-to-stay approach, we explored potential changes in frequencies of infections among children following the adaptation to the test-to-stay approach by applying regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analyses. To this end, PCR-test data were linked with routinely collected data on reported infections in children and analyzed using ordinary least squares regressions. Results 219,885 Pool-PCRs and 352,305 Single-PCRs were performed. 6,440 (2.93%) Pool-PCRs tested positive, and 17,208 infections in children were reported. We estimated that during a period of 30 weeks, the test-to-stay concept avoided between 7 and 20 days of quarantine per eligible daycare child. RDiT revealed a 26% reduction (Exp. Coef: 0.74, CI:0.52;1.06) in infection frequency among children and indicated no significant increase attributable to the test-to-stay approach. This result was not sensitive to adjustments for 7-day incidence, season, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and socioeconomic status. Conclusion Our analyses provide evidence that suggest safety of the test-to-stay approach compared to traditional quarantine measures. This approach offers a promising option to avoid use of quarantine after exposure to respiratory pathogens in daycare settings.\nExploring the potential of a saliva-based, RNA-extraction-free PCR test for the multiplexed detection of key respiratory pathogens\nAuthors: Allicock, O. M.; Lin, T.-Y.; Fajardo, K. T.; Yolda-Carr, D.; Hislop, M.; Zuniga, D.; Platt, W.; Tuhoy, B.; Wang, J.; Wyllie, A. L.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296240\nIntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens. MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at +4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([\u0026ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction. ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.\nReanalysis of cluster randomized trial data to account for exposure misclassification using a per-protocol and complier-restricted approach\nAuthors: Dufault, S. M.; Tanamas, S. K.; Indriani, C.; Ahmad, R. A.; Utarini, A.; Jewell, N. P.; Simmons, C. P.; Anders, K. L.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.20.23288835\nThe intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial estimated a protective efficacy of 77.1% for participants resident in areas randomised to receive releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, an emerging dengue preventive intervention. The limiting assumptions of ITT analyses in cluster randomised trials and the mobility of mosquitoes and humans across cluster boundaries indicate the primary analysis is likely to underestimate the full public health benefit. Using spatiotemporally-resolved data on the distribution of Wolbachia mosquitoes and on the mobility of AWED participants (n = 6,306), we perform complier-restricted and per-protocol re-examinations of the efficacy of the Wolbachia intervention. Increased intervention efficacy was estimated in all analyses by the refined exposure measures. The complier-restricted analysis returned an estimated efficacy of 80.7% (95% CI: 65.9, 89.0) and the per-protocol analysis estimated 82.7% (71.7, 88.4) efficacy when comparing participants with an estimated wMel exposure of[\u0026ge;] 80% compared to those with \u003c20%. These reanalyses demonstrate how human and mosquito movement can lead to underestimation of intervention effects in trials of vector interventions and indicate that the protective efficacy of Wolbachia is even higher than reported in the primary trial results.\nLong-term experience operating CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour in a K-5 elementary school using HEPA and MERV 16 Do-It-Yourself (DIY) portable air cleaners\nAuthors: Srikrishna, D.\nScore: 54.7, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.05.22281734\nOn May 12, 2023 CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour (5 ACH) and in July 2021 California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 ACH to reduce long-range, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens in classrooms. EPA recommends MERV 13+ DIY air cleaners for temporary use during wildfires, and a recent EPA study reported inconsistent usage in homes due to excessive noise generated by the DIY air cleaners. Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 MERV 16 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during two academic school years from spring 2021 through fall of 2023 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet 6 to 12 ACH. Teachers reported noise generated by MERV 16 DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 m (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5\" MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averaged 77% after six months (1st batch in February 2022) compared to 92% for newly installed filters (2nd batch in October 2022). Follow up testing on both batches of filters after an additional academic year (June 2023) showed only slight changes in average filtration efficiency. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for $200-$650 with DIY versus $600-$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. Based on this long-term experience, specific recommendations for enhancing and improving CDCs web page \"Ventilation in Buildings\" include: (1) recommended operation of MERV 13+ DIY at their low speed for low noise, cost-effective air cleaning (2) electro-mechanical safety especially in relation to power outlets (3) an open-source procedure known as the \"spike test\" using ambient aerosols to verify ACH in a room, like the Portacount for mask fit testing. Spike testing can become the basis for ACH certification or verification in any room without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers which may be unsafe or disallowed indoors).\nBioinformatic Analysis of Defective Viral Genomes in SARS-CoV-2 and Its Impact on Population Infection Characteristics\nAuthors: Xu, Z.; Peng, Q.; Song, J.; Zhang, H.; Wei, D.; Demongeot, J.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296580\nDVGs (Defective Viral Genomes) and SIP (Semi-Infectious Particle) are commonly present in RNA virus infections. In this study, we analyzed high-throughput sequencing data and found that DVGs or SIPs are also widely present in SARS-CoV-2. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with various DNA viruses revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more susceptible to damage and has greater sequencing sample heterogeneity. Variability analysis at the whole-genome sequencing depth showed a higher coefficient of variation for SARS-CoV-2, and DVG analysis indicated a high proportion of splicing sites, suggesting significant genome heterogeneity and implying that most virus particles assembled are enveloped with incomplete RNA sequences. We further analyzed the characteristics of different strains in terms of sequencing depth and DVG content differences and found that as the virus evolves, the proportion of intact genomes in virus particles increases, which can be significantly reflected in third-generation sequencing data, while the proportion of DVG gradually decreases. Specifically, the proportion of intact genome of Omicron was greater than that of Delta and Alpha strains. This can well explain why Omicron strain is more infectious than Delta and Alpha strains. We also speculate that this improvement in completeness is due to the enhancement of virus assembly ability, as the Omicron strain can quickly realize the binding of RNA and capsid protein, thereby shortening the exposure time of exposed virus RNA in the host environment and greatly reducing its degradation level. Finally, by using mathematical modeling, we simulated how DVG effects under different environmental factors affect the infection characteristics and evolution of the population. We can explain well why the severity of symptoms is closely related to the amount of virus invasion and why the same strain causes huge differences in population infection characteristics under different environmental conditions. Our study provides a new approach for future virus research and vaccine development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Uptake of mRNA vaccines, especially booster immunizations, against COVID-19 has been lower than hoped, perhaps in part due to their reactogenicity. Analgesics might alleviate symptoms associated with vaccination, but studies to measure their impact on immune responses have been limited to relatively small cohorts. We semi-quantitatively measured antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination in 2354 participants surveyed about analgesic use. Participants who used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen after vaccination showed elevated antibody levels against the receptor binding domain of Spike protein relative to those who did not use analgesics. This pattern was observed for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and across age groups. Participants who used analgesics more frequently reported fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches than those who did not use painkillers. Amongst participants who reported these symptoms, we observed no statistically significant differences in antibody levels irrespective of analgesic use. These data suggest that antibody levels are elevated as a function of symptoms and inflammatory processes rather than painkiller use per se. Taken together, we find no evidence that analgesic use reduces antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendation of their use to alleviate symptoms might improve uptake of booster immunizations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants efficiently evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, requiring vaccine adaptation. Here, we analyzed immunogenicity of an adapted vaccine, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5, which is currently used for booster vaccination. Booster vaccination significantly increased anti-Spike IgG, accompanied by expansion of cross-reactive memory B cells recognizing Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 spike variants. Geometric mean neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3, as well as cross-reactive responses against EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 increased significantly relative to pre-booster titers. Finally, the number of Wuhan and XBB.1.5 spike reactive IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells significantly increased after booster vaccination. In summary, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccination resulted in potent neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron XBB variants, including the recent Omicron variants EG.5.1 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), as well as XBB.1.5 reactive T cell responses, suggesting that booster vaccination will augment protection against these emerging variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nasopharyngeal sampling (NP) is the routine standard for SASR-CoV-2 detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this systematic review, we assessed diagnostic test accuracy of alternative sampling sites compared to NP for RT-PCR testing of Omicron (sub)-variants.

We systematically searched for studies from January 2022 until February 2023 investigating any type of respiratory sample for RT-PCR in people with suspected, known, or known absence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE.

We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low.

Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From 2003 to 25 February 2023, the avian influenza (H5N1) virus was confirmed in 59 human infections, including 39 deaths ([~]66% case-fatality rate) reported in 13 of 25 provinces in Cambodia. We aimed to assess current knowledge, attitude, and practice toward changes in poultry handling behaviors, poultry consumption, and poultry mortality reporting among rural villagers in areas affected by Avian influenza (H5N1) in Cambodia. A cross-section survey was conducted in August 2023. There were 208 participants residing in Prey Veng province who were invited to be interviewed face-to-face. Descriptive statistics were performed using STATA V17. The participants average age was 55 years old (SD=13.3 years), 78.4% were female, 59% had completed primary school, 56.7% were farmers, 68.3% raised chickens in their backyards, and 10.2% raised ducks, 23% of participants cooked sick or dead birds for their families, 32% knowing information about avian influenza virus was a lower proportion from healthcare providers, 10.6% from village health support groups were, and 2% from village animal health workers were only, 49% have been reported poultry illness and deaths to local authorities. The avian influenza epidemic in Cambodia is a genuine threat to animals and a possible concern to humans. To prevent and control this, we strongly advise everyone who works with poultry or wild game birds always to be prepared to follow appropriate hygiene standards and to cook poultry meat properly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Objectives Test-to-stay concepts apply serial testing of children in daycare after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 without use of quarantine. This study aims to assess safety of a test-to-stay screening in daycare facilities. Methods 714 daycare facilities and approximately 50,000 children [&amp;le;]6 years in Cologne, Germany participated in a SARS-CoV-2 Pool-PCR screening from March 2021 to April 2022. The screening initially comprised post-exposure quarantine and was adapted to a test-to-stay approach during its course. To assess safety of the test-to-stay approach, we explored potential changes in frequencies of infections among children following the adaptation to the test-to-stay approach by applying regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analyses. To this end, PCR-test data were linked with routinely collected data on reported infections in children and analyzed using ordinary least squares regressions. Results 219,885 Pool-PCRs and 352,305 Single-PCRs were performed. 6,440 (2.93%) Pool-PCRs tested positive, and 17,208 infections in children were reported. We estimated that during a period of 30 weeks, the test-to-stay concept avoided between 7 and 20 days of quarantine per eligible daycare child. RDiT revealed a 26% reduction (Exp. Coef: 0.74, CI:0.52;1.06) in infection frequency among children and indicated no significant increase attributable to the test-to-stay approach. This result was not sensitive to adjustments for 7-day incidence, season, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and socioeconomic status. Conclusion Our analyses provide evidence that suggest safety of the test-to-stay approach compared to traditional quarantine measures. This approach offers a promising option to avoid use of quarantine after exposure to respiratory pathogens in daycare settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens.

MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at &#43;4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([&amp;ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction.

ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial estimated a protective efficacy of 77.1% for participants resident in areas randomised to receive releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, an emerging dengue preventive intervention. The limiting assumptions of ITT analyses in cluster randomised trials and the mobility of mosquitoes and humans across cluster boundaries indicate the primary analysis is likely to underestimate the full public health benefit. Using spatiotemporally-resolved data on the distribution of Wolbachia mosquitoes and on the mobility of AWED participants (n = 6,306), we perform complier-restricted and per-protocol re-examinations of the efficacy of the Wolbachia intervention. Increased intervention efficacy was estimated in all analyses by the refined exposure measures. The complier-restricted analysis returned an estimated efficacy of 80.7% (95% CI: 65.9, 89.0) and the per-protocol analysis estimated 82.7% (71.7, 88.4) efficacy when comparing participants with an estimated wMel exposure of[&amp;ge;] 80% compared to those with &lt;20%. These reanalyses demonstrate how human and mosquito movement can lead to underestimation of intervention effects in trials of vector interventions and indicate that the protective efficacy of Wolbachia is even higher than reported in the primary trial results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">On May 12, 2023 CDC recommended 5 air changes per hour (5 ACH) and in July 2021 California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 ACH to reduce long-range, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens in classrooms. EPA recommends MERV 13&#43; DIY air cleaners for temporary use during wildfires, and a recent EPA study reported inconsistent usage in homes due to excessive noise generated by the DIY air cleaners. Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 MERV 16 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during two academic school years from spring 2021 through fall of 2023 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet 6 to 12 ACH. Teachers reported noise generated by MERV 16 DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 m (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5&#34; MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averaged 77% after six months (1st batch in February 2022) compared to 92% for newly installed filters (2nd batch in October 2022). Follow up testing on both batches of filters after an additional academic year (June 2023) showed only slight changes in average filtration efficiency. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for $200-$650 with DIY versus $600-$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. Based on this long-term experience, specific recommendations for enhancing and improving CDCs web page &#34;Ventilation in Buildings&#34; include: (1) recommended operation of MERV 13&#43; DIY at their low speed for low noise, cost-effective air cleaning (2) electro-mechanical safety especially in relation to power outlets (3) an open-source procedure known as the &#34;spike test&#34; using ambient aerosols to verify ACH in a room, like the Portacount for mask fit testing. Spike testing can become the basis for ACH certification or verification in any room without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers which may be unsafe or disallowed indoors).</p>

        <p class="abstract">DVGs (Defective Viral Genomes) and SIP (Semi-Infectious Particle) are commonly present in RNA virus infections. In this study, we analyzed high-throughput sequencing data and found that DVGs or SIPs are also widely present in SARS-CoV-2. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with various DNA viruses revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more susceptible to damage and has greater sequencing sample heterogeneity. Variability analysis at the whole-genome sequencing depth showed a higher coefficient of variation for SARS-CoV-2, and DVG analysis indicated a high proportion of splicing sites, suggesting significant genome heterogeneity and implying that most virus particles assembled are enveloped with incomplete RNA sequences. We further analyzed the characteristics of different strains in terms of sequencing depth and DVG content differences and found that as the virus evolves, the proportion of intact genomes in virus particles increases, which can be significantly reflected in third-generation sequencing data, while the proportion of DVG gradually decreases. Specifically, the proportion of intact genome of Omicron was greater than that of Delta and Alpha strains. This can well explain why Omicron strain is more infectious than Delta and Alpha strains. We also speculate that this improvement in completeness is due to the enhancement of virus assembly ability, as the Omicron strain can quickly realize the binding of RNA and capsid protein, thereby shortening the exposure time of exposed virus RNA in the host environment and greatly reducing its degradation level. Finally, by using mathematical modeling, we simulated how DVG effects under different environmental factors affect the infection characteristics and evolution of the population. We can explain well why the severity of symptoms is closely related to the amount of virus invasion and why the same strain causes huge differences in population infection characteristics under different environmental conditions. Our study provides a new approach for future virus research and vaccine development.</p>
