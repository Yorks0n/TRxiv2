M.\nScore: 276.9, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298565\nAdverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P\u003c.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P\u003c.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P\u003c.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P\u003c.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P\u003c.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P\u003c.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.\nThe spectrum of non-fatal immune-related adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination: The population-based cohort study in Seoul, South Korea\nAuthors: Suh, J. H.; Kim, H. J.; Kim, M.-H.; Choi, M. G.; Chun, E. M.\nScore: 147.4, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298566\nObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination. ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs. ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.\nPost-pandemic memory T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is durable, broadly targeted and cross-reactive to hypermutated BA.2.86\nAuthors: Nesamari, R.; Omondi, M. A.; Hoft, M. A.; Ngomti, A.; Baguma, R.; Nkayi, A. A.; Besethi, A. S.; Magugu, S. F.; Mosala, P.; Walters, A.; Clark, G. M.; Mennen, M.; Skelem, S.; Adriaanse, M.; Grifoni, A.; Sette, A.; Keeton, R. S.; Ntusi, N. A.; Riou, C.; Burgers, W. A.\nScore: 64.8, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297714\nThe COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson \u0026 Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19. In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypic resistance in people treated with entecavir or tenofovir\nAuthors: Lumley, S. F.; Delphin, M.; Mokaya, J. F.; Tan, C. C.; Martyn, E.; Anderson, M.; Li, K. C.; Waddilove, E.; Sukali, G.; Downs, L. O.; Said, K.; Okanda, D.; Campbell, C.; Harriss, E.; Shimakawa, Y.; Matthews, P. C.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298154\nBackgroundAs nucleos/tide analogue (NA) therapy for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes more widely indicated and available, understanding drug resistance is essential. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of genotypic resistance to tenofovir and entecavir. MethodsWe searched nine databases up to 29-Aug-23. We included studies of HBV infection featuring \u003e10 individuals, written in English, reporting tenofovir or entecavir treatment [\u0026ge;]48 weeks, with assessment of HBV genotypic resistance. Data were analysed according to prior exposure history to NA, and treatment with tenofovir or entecavir. Analyses were performed in R. Results62 studies involving a total of 12,358 participants were included. For tenofovir, pooled resistance risk was 0.0% at all time points, whether previously NA naive (11 studies; 3778 individuals) or experienced (19 studies; 2059 individuals). For entecavir, in treatment-naive individuals (22 studies; 4326 individuals), risk of resistance increased over time to 0.9% at [\u0026ge;]5 years (95%CI 0.1-2.3%). Entecavir resistance was increased in NA-experienced individuals (18 studies;1112 individuals), to 20.1% (95%CI 1.6-50.1%) at [\u0026ge;]5 years. There was a lack of consistent definitions, poor global representation and insufficient metadata to support subgroup analysis. DiscussionBased on existing data, tenofovir has an excellent resistance profile. More resistance is seen with entecavir, particularly in treatment-experienced groups. Due to data gaps, we may have under-estimated the true risk of resistance. Robust prospective data collection is crucial as treatment is rolled out more widely.\nCountry wide surveillance reveals prevalent artemisinin partial resistance mutations with evidence for multiple origins and expansion of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations in northwest Tanzania\nAuthors: Juliano, J. J.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Simkin, A.; Fola, A. A.; Lyimo, B. M.; Perus, D.; Bakari, C.; Madebe, R. A.; Seth, M. D.; Mandara, C. I.; Popkin-Hall, Z. R.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Niare, K.; MacInnis, B.; Francis, F.; Mbwambo, D.; Garimo, I.; Chacky, F.; Aaron, S.; Lusasi, A.; Molteni, F.; Njau, R.; Lazaro, S.; Mohamed, A.; Bailey, J. A.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 22.8, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298207\nBackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526). InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.\nBaseline malaria infection status and RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine efficacy\nAuthors: Juraska, M.; Early, A. M.; Li, L.; Schaffner, S. F.; Lievens, M.; Khorgade, A. R.; Simpkins, B.; Hejazi, N.; Benkeser, D. A.; Wang, Q.; Mercer, L. D.; Adjei, S.; Agbenyega, T.; Anderson, S.; Ansong, D.; Bii, D. K.; Buabeng, P. B. Y.; English, S.; Fitzgerald, N.; Grimsby, J.; Kariuki, S. K.; Otieno, K.; Roman, F. P.; Samuels, A. M.; Westercamp, N.; Ockenhouse, C. F.; Ofori-Anyinam, O.; Lee, C. K.; MacInnis, B. L.; Wirth, D. F.; Gilbert, P.; Neafsey, D. E.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298907\nBackground The only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE). 1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection. We observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059). All tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation.

R.; Greenhalf, W.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.23298162\nBackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed. Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge\nRe-emergence of Sylvatic Dengue 2 during an outbreak in Southeastern Senegal, Kedougou 2020\nAuthors: Dieng, I.; Diarra, M.; Sadio, B.

R.; Stankard, P.; Parikh, N.; Ranawat, P.; Kaur, R.; AG, S.; Chaudhuri, A.; Shilton, S.; Srinivasan, A.; Chowdhury, J.; Ivanova Reipold, E.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298784\nIn order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.\nAntibody response to symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant viruses, December 2021 to June 2022\nAuthors: Sandford, R.; Yadav, R.

M.; Pearce, B.; Rogier, E.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298700\nTo describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Adverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P&lt;.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P&lt;.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P&lt;.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P&lt;.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P&lt;.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P&lt;.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs.

ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs nucleos/tide analogue (NA) therapy for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes more widely indicated and available, understanding drug resistance is essential. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of genotypic resistance to tenofovir and entecavir.

MethodsWe searched nine databases up to 29-Aug-23. We included studies of HBV infection featuring &gt;10 individuals, written in English, reporting tenofovir or entecavir treatment [&amp;ge;]48 weeks, with assessment of HBV genotypic resistance. Data were analysed according to prior exposure history to NA, and treatment with tenofovir or entecavir. Analyses were performed in R.

Results62 studies involving a total of 12,358 participants were included. For tenofovir, pooled resistance risk was 0.0% at all time points, whether previously NA naive (11 studies; 3778 individuals) or experienced (19 studies; 2059 individuals). For entecavir, in treatment-naive individuals (22 studies; 4326 individuals), risk of resistance increased over time to 0.9% at [&amp;ge;]5 years (95%CI 0.1-2.3%). Entecavir resistance was increased in NA-experienced individuals (18 studies;1112 individuals), to 20.1% (95%CI 1.6-50.1%) at [&amp;ge;]5 years. There was a lack of consistent definitions, poor global representation and insufficient metadata to support subgroup analysis.

DiscussionBased on existing data, tenofovir has an excellent resistance profile. More resistance is seen with entecavir, particularly in treatment-experienced groups. Due to data gaps, we may have under-estimated the true risk of resistance. Robust prospective data collection is crucial as treatment is rolled out more widely.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high.

MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform.

FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526).

InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE). 1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection. We observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059). All tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge.

MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias.

FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups.

InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.

Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge</p>

        <p class="abstract">In order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.</p>
