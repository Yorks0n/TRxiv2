A.; Ngomti, A.; Baguma, R.; Nkayi, A. A.; Besethi, A. S.; Magugu, S. F.; Mosala, P.; Walters, A.; Clark, G. M.; Mennen, M.; Skelem, S.; Adriaanse, M.; Grifoni, A.; Sette, A.; Keeton, R. S.; Ntusi, N. A.; Riou, C.; Burgers, W. A.\nScore: 31.9, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297714\nThe COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson \u0026 Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19. In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.\nCountry wide surveillance reveals prevalent artemisinin partial resistance mutations with evidence for multiple origins and expansion of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations in northwest Tanzania\nAuthors: Juliano, J. J.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Simkin, A.; Fola, A. A.; Lyimo, B. M.; Perus, D.; Bakari, C.; Madebe, R. A.; Seth, M. D.; Mandara, C. I.; Popkin-Hall, Z. R.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Niare, K.; MacInnis, B.; Francis, F.; Mbwambo, D.; Garimo, I.; Chacky, F.; Aaron, S.; Lusasi, A.; Molteni, F.; Njau, R.; Lazaro, S.; Mohamed, A.; Bailey, J. A.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298207\nBackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526). InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.\nOne year health outcomes associated with systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Leavy, O. C.; Russell, R. J.; Harrison, E. M.; Lone, N. I.; Kerr, S.; Docherty, A. B.; Sheikh, A.; Richardson, M.; Elneima, O.; Greening, N. J.; Harris, V. C.; Houchen-Wolloff, L.; McAuley, H. J.

G.; Jolley, C.; Thompson, A. R.; Chalder, T.; Davies, M. J.; De Soyza, A.; Geddes, J. R.; Greenhalf, W.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.23298162\nBackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed. Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge\nSynergistic Role of NK Cells and Monocytes in Promoting Atherogenesis in Severe COVID-19 Patients.\nAuthors: Gunasena, M.; Alles, M.; Wijewantha, Y.; Mulhern, W.; Bowman, E.; Gabriel, J.; Kettelhut, A.; Kumar, A.; Weragalaarachchi, K.; Kasturiratna, D.; Horowitz, J. C.; Scrape, S.; Pannu, S. R.; Liu, S.-L.; Vilgelm, A.; Wijeratne, S.; Bednash, J. S.; Demberg, T.; Funderburg, N. T.; Liyanage, N.\nScore: 35.5, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298322\nClinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.\nPhenotypic and genomic analysis of a large-scale Corynebacterium diphtheriae outbreak among migrant populations in Europe\nAuthors: Hoefer, A.; Seth-Smith, H. M.; Palma, F.; Schindler, S.; Freschi, L.; Dangel, A.; Berger, A.; D'Aeth, J. C.; 2022 European diphtheria Consortium, ; Indra, A.; Fry, N. K.; Palm, D.; Sing, A.; Brisse, S.; Egli, A.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23297228\nBackgroundIncreased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak. MethodsAll 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied. ResultsFour major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020. ConclusionsThe multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.\nTuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: diagnostic challenges and determinants of outcome\nAuthors: Kurver, L.; Seers, T.; van Dorp, S.; van Crevel, R.; Pollara, G.; van Laarhoven, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298501\nBackgroundTuberculosis (TB) can induce secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome with high mortality. To improve insight into optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies, we integrated all published reports of adult HIV-negative TB-associated HLH (TB-HLH) globally to define clinical characteristics and therapeutic approaches associated with improved survival. MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Global Index Medicus were searched for eligible records. TB-HLH cases were categorized into patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis receiving antituberculosis treatment while developing HLH, and patients presenting with HLH of unknown cause later diagnosed with TB. We integrated patients clinical characteristics, diagnostic test results, and pre-specified parameters associated with survival into a logistic regression model. ResultsWe identified 115 individually reported cases, 45 (39.1%) from low TB incidence countries (\u003c10/100.000 per year). Compared to HLH patients with known TB (n=21), patients with HLH of unknown cause (n=94), more often had extrapulmonary TB (88.3% vs. 66.7%), while the opposite was true for pulmonary disease (59.6% vs. 91.5%). Overall, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in the bone marrow in 78.4% of patients for whom examination was reported (n=74). Only 10.5% (4/38) of patients tested had a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay. In-hospital survival was 71.9% (69/96) in those treated for TB and 0% (18/18) in those who did not receive antituberculosis treatment (p \u003c 0.001). ConclusionsTuberculosis should be considered as a cause of unexplained HLH. TB-HLH is probably under-reported, and the diagnostic work-up of HLH patients should include bone marrow examination for evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Prompt initiation of antituberculosis treatment will likely improve survival. Key pointsHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an underreported complication of tuberculosis, often manifesting as extrapulmonary or miliary disease. TST and IGRA mostly show an anergic response. Threshold should be low bone marrow investigation for evidence of M. tuberculosis, and commencement of antituberculosis treatment.\nFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators of α1-acid glycoprotein fucosylation\nAuthors: Oltmanns, C.; Bremer, B.; Kusche, L.; Stal, P.; Zenlander, R.; Tauwaldt, J.; Ryden, I.; Pahlsson, P.; Cornberg, M.; Wedemeyer, H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298443\nBackground and AimsThere is an urgent need for new high-quality markers in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [A]strom et al. suggested that S2-bound 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) might be a promising marker. Consequently, we evaluated S2-bound AGP for a predictive advantage in the early detection of HCC. MethodsIn a retrospective case-control study of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (n=93), we measured S2-bound AGP using the HepaCheC(R) ELISA kit (Glycobond AB, Linkoping, SE) at treatment start, end of treatment and follow-up (maximum: 78 months). Patients were retrospectively propensity score matched (1:2). 31 patients chronically infected with HCV developed HCC after sustained virological response while 62 did not. In addition, samples of HBV, MASLD and HCC from different etiologies patients were measured. ResultsS2-bound AGP elevation in HCC patients was confirmed. However, we did not observe a predictive advantage of S2-bound AGP in early detection of HCC during treatment and follow-up. Interestingly, S2-bound AGP levels correlated with aspartate aminotransferase ({rho}=0.56, p=9.5x10-15) and liver elastography ({rho}=0.67, p=2.2x10-16). Of note, S2-bound AGP decreased in patients chronically infected with HCV after treatment-induced clearance of HCV. ConclusionFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators in the fucosylation of AGP. The potential role of S2-bound AGP as a novel tumor marker requires further investigation.

L.; Noble, E. K.; Sumner, K. M.; Joshi, D. J.; Tartof, S. Y.; Wernli, K. J.; Martin, E. T.; Gaglani, M.; Zimmerman, R.; Talbot, H. K.; Grijalva, C. G.; Belongia, E. A.; Carlson, C.; Coughlin, M.; Flannery, B. M.; Pearce, B.; Rogier, E.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298700\nTo describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.\nAssessment of the Usability of SARS-CoV-2 Self Tests in a Peer-Assisted Model among Factory Workers in Bengaluru, India\nAuthors: Pydi, M. R.; Stankard, P.; Parikh, N.; Ranawat, P.; Kaur, R.; AG, S.; Chaudhuri, A.; Shilton, S.; Srinivasan, A.; Chowdhury, J.; Ivanova Reipold, E.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298784\nIn order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants' kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories' peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.\nImproving Individualized Treatment Decisions: A Bayesian Multivariate Hierarchical Model for Developing a Treatment Benefit Index using Mixed Types of Outcomes\nAuthors: Wu, D.; Goldfeld, K. S.; Petkova, E.; Park, H. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298711\nBackgroundPrecision medicine has led to the development of targeted treatment strategies tailored to individual patients based on their characteristics and disease manifestations. Although precision medicine often focuses on a single health outcome for individualized treatment decision rules (ITRs), relying only on a single outcome rather than all available outcomes information leads to suboptimal data usage when developing optimal ITRs. MethodsTo address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model that leverages the wealth of correlated health outcomes collected in clinical trials. The approach jointly models mixed types of correlated outcomes, facilitating the \"borrowing of information\" across the multivariate outcomes, and results in a more accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects compared to using single regression models for each outcome. We develop a treatment benefit index, which quantifies the relative treatment benefit of the experimental treatment over the control treatment, based on the proposed multivariate outcome model. ResultsWe demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach through extensive simulations and an application to an international Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment trial. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the occurrence of erroneous treatment decisions compared to a single regression model for a single health outcome. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model across various study scenarios. Application of the method to the COVID-19 trial exhibits improvements in estimating the individual-level treatment efficacy (indicated by narrower credible intervals for odds ratios) and optimal ITRs. ConclusionThe study jointly models mixed types of outcomes in the context of developing ITRs. By considering multiple health outcomes, the proposed approach can advance the development of more effective and reliable personalized treatment\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high.

MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform.

FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526).

InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge.

MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias.

FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups.

InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.

Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIncreased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak.

MethodsAll 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied.

ResultsFour major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020.

ConclusionsThe multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) can induce secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome with high mortality. To improve insight into optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies, we integrated all published reports of adult HIV-negative TB-associated HLH (TB-HLH) globally to define clinical characteristics and therapeutic approaches associated with improved survival.

MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Global Index Medicus were searched for eligible records. TB-HLH cases were categorized into patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis receiving antituberculosis treatment while developing HLH, and patients presenting with HLH of unknown cause later diagnosed with TB. We integrated patients clinical characteristics, diagnostic test results, and pre-specified parameters associated with survival into a logistic regression model.

ResultsWe identified 115 individually reported cases, 45 (39.1%) from low TB incidence countries (&lt;10/100.000 per year). Compared to HLH patients with known TB (n=21), patients with HLH of unknown cause (n=94), more often had extrapulmonary TB (88.3% vs. 66.7%), while the opposite was true for pulmonary disease (59.6% vs. 91.5%). Overall, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in the bone marrow in 78.4% of patients for whom examination was reported (n=74). Only 10.5% (4/38) of patients tested had a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay. In-hospital survival was 71.9% (69/96) in those treated for TB and 0% (18/18) in those who did not receive antituberculosis treatment (p &lt; 0.001).

ConclusionsTuberculosis should be considered as a cause of unexplained HLH. TB-HLH is probably under-reported, and the diagnostic work-up of HLH patients should include bone marrow examination for evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Prompt initiation of antituberculosis treatment will likely improve survival.

Key pointsHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an underreported complication of tuberculosis, often manifesting as extrapulmonary or miliary disease. TST and IGRA mostly show an anergic response. Threshold should be low bone marrow investigation for evidence of M. tuberculosis, and commencement of antituberculosis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsThere is an urgent need for new high-quality markers in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [A]strom et al. suggested that S2-bound 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) might be a promising marker. Consequently, we evaluated S2-bound AGP for a predictive advantage in the early detection of HCC.

MethodsIn a retrospective case-control study of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (n=93), we measured S2-bound AGP using the HepaCheC(R) ELISA kit (Glycobond AB, Linkoping, SE) at treatment start, end of treatment and follow-up (maximum: 78 months). Patients were retrospectively propensity score matched (1:2). 31 patients chronically infected with HCV developed HCC after sustained virological response while 62 did not. In addition, samples of HBV, MASLD and HCC from different etiologies patients were measured.

ResultsS2-bound AGP elevation in HCC patients was confirmed. However, we did not observe a predictive advantage of S2-bound AGP in early detection of HCC during treatment and follow-up. Interestingly, S2-bound AGP levels correlated with aspartate aminotransferase ({rho}=0.56, p=9.5x10-15) and liver elastography ({rho}=0.67, p=2.2x10-16). Of note, S2-bound AGP decreased in patients chronically infected with HCV after treatment-induced clearance of HCV.

ConclusionFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators in the fucosylation of AGP. The potential role of S2-bound AGP as a novel tumor marker requires further investigation.

        <p class="abstract">To describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants&#39; kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories&#39; peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrecision medicine has led to the development of targeted treatment strategies tailored to individual patients based on their characteristics and disease manifestations. Although precision medicine often focuses on a single health outcome for individualized treatment decision rules (ITRs), relying only on a single outcome rather than all available outcomes information leads to suboptimal data usage when developing optimal ITRs.

MethodsTo address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model that leverages the wealth of correlated health outcomes collected in clinical trials. The approach jointly models mixed types of correlated outcomes, facilitating the &#34;borrowing of information&#34; across the multivariate outcomes, and results in a more accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects compared to using single regression models for each outcome. We develop a treatment benefit index, which quantifies the relative treatment benefit of the experimental treatment over the control treatment, based on the proposed multivariate outcome model.

ResultsWe demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach through extensive simulations and an application to an international Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment trial. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the occurrence of erroneous treatment decisions compared to a single regression model for a single health outcome. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model across various study scenarios. Application of the method to the COVID-19 trial exhibits improvements in estimating the individual-level treatment efficacy (indicated by narrower credible intervals for odds ratios) and optimal ITRs.

ConclusionThe study jointly models mixed types of outcomes in the context of developing ITRs. By considering multiple health outcomes, the proposed approach can advance the development of more effective and reliable personalized treatment</p>
