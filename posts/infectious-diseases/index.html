J.\nScore: 1135.7, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293177\nThe etiologic mechanisms of post-acute medical morbidities and unexplained symptoms (Long COVID) following SARS-CoV-2 infection are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence and immune dysregulation may play a major role. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, [18F]F-AraG, a highly selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the post-acute COVID group, which included those with and without Long COVID symptoms, was significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic controls in many anatomical regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. Although T cell activation tended to be higher in participants imaged closer to the time of the acute illness, tracer uptake was increased in participants imaged up to 2.5 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that T cell activation in spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of Long COVID symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Notably, increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without Long COVID. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of participants with Long COVID symptoms. We identified cellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all these participants, ranging from 158 to 676 days following initial COVID-19 illness, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunological perturbations.\nCovid-19 related cognitive, structural and functional brain changes among Italian adolescents and young adults: a multimodal longitudinal case-control study\nAuthors: Invernizzi, A.; Renzetti, S.; van Thriel, C.; Rechtman, E.; Patrono, A.; Ambrosi, C.; Mascaro, L.; Cagna, G.; Gasparotti, R.; Reichenberg, A.; Tang, C. Y.; Lucchini, R. G.; Wright, R. O.; Placidi, D.; Horton, M.\nScore: 65.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292909\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with brain functional, structural, and cognitive changes that persist months after infection. Most studies of the neurologic outcomes related to COVID-19 focus on severe infection and aging populations. Here, we investigated the neural activities underlying COVID-19 related outcomes in a case-control study of mildly infected youth enrolled in a longitudinal study in Lombardy, Italy, a global hotspot of COVID-19. All participants (13 cases, 27 controls, mean age 24 years) completed resting state functional (fMRI), structural MRI, cognitive assessments (CANTAB spatial working memory) at baseline (pre-COVID) and follow-up (post-COVID). Using graph theory eigenvector centrality (EC) and data-driven statistical methods, we examined differences in ECdelta (i.e., the difference in EC values pre- and post-COVID-19) and volumetricdelta (i.e., the difference in cortical volume of cortical and subcortical areas pre- and post-COVID) between COVID-19 cases and controls. We found that ECdeltasignificantly between COVID-19 and healthy participants in five brain regions; right intracalcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus, left hippocampus, left amygdala, left frontal orbital cortex. The left hippocampus showed a significant decrease in volumetricdeltabetween groups (p=0.041). The reduced ECdelta in the right amygdala associated with COVID-19 status mediated the association between COVID-19 and disrupted spatial working memory. Our results show persistent structural, functional and cognitive brain changes in key brain areas associated with olfaction and cognition. These results may guide treatment efforts to assess the longevity, reversibility and impact of the observed brain and cognitive changes following COVID-19.\nMucosal and Systemic Immune Correlates of Viral Control following SARS-CoV-2 Infection Challenge in Seronegative Adults\nAuthors: Wagstaffe, H. R.; Thwaites, R. S.; Reynaldi, A.; Sidhu, J. K.; McKendry, R.; Ascough, S.; Papargyris, L.; Collins, A. M.; Xu, J.; Lemm, N.-M.; Siggins, M. K.; Chain, B. M.; Killingley, B.; Kalinova, M.; Mann, A.; Catchpole, A.; Davenport, M. P.; Openshaw, P. J. M.; Chiu, C.\nScore: 36.0, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292994\nHuman infection challenge permits characterisation of the associated immune response in unparalleled depth, enabling evaluation of early pre-symptomatic immune changes and the dynamic immune factors important for viral clearance. Here, 34 healthy young adult volunteers, seronegative to SARS-CoV-2, were inoculated with a D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2 strain. Nasal and systemic soluble mediator and antibody responses, and peripheral blood T cell and B cell responses were measured by MesoScale Discovery and flow cytometry just before and up to 1 year after intra-nasal inoculation. In the 18 (53%) participants who became infected, both nasal and systemic mediator responses were dominated by interferons (IFN) but with divergent kinetics. T cell activation and proliferation in blood peaked at day 10 in CD4+ T cells and day 14 in CD8+ T cells, returning to baseline by day 28. Following infection, antigen-specific T cells were largely CD38+Ki67+ and displayed central and effector memory phenotypes. T cells contracted after viral clearance with expanded antigen-specific memory T cell populations persisting past day 28. Both mucosal and systemic antibodies became detectable around day 10 but nasal antibodies plateaued after day 14 while circulating antibodies continued to rise. Using piecewise linear regression modelling, viral load related closely to the induction of type I IFN responses, moreover, CD8+ T cell responses and early IgA responses were strongly associated with viral clearance. Detailed analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection following human challenge thus revealed the relationship between immune kinetics and viral load as factors associated with resolution of infection.\nComparison of the analytical and clinical sensitivity of thirty-four rapid antigen tests with the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK\nAuthors: Byrne, R. L.; Aljayyoussi, G.; Greenland - Bews, C.; Kontogianni, K.; Wooding, D.; Williams, C. T.; de Vos, M.; Body, R.; Adams, E. R.; Escadafel, C.; Edwards, T. R.; Cubas Atienzar, A. I.\nScore: 82.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293072\nBackgroundThe continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires timely analytical and clinical evaluation of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) especially those that are recommended for at home use. MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) of 34 Ag-RDTs was evaluated using the most encountered SARS-CoV-2 VOC viral isolates (Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.5) and the wild type (WT). Clinical sensitivity was further evaluated for five Ag-RDT utilising retrospective samples (Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1) and one Ag-RDT utilising prospective clinical samples (Delta and Omicron BA.1). FindingsFor the WT, Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron (BA.1) variants 22, 32, 29, 31 and 32 of the 34 Ag-RDTs evaluated met the World Health Organisations (WHO) target product profile (TPP), respectively. Of the 31 Ag-RDTs included for Omicron BA.5 evaluation 29 met the WHO TPP. Additionally, the LODs for samples spiked with Omicron BA.5 were significantly lower than all other VOCs included (p\u003c0.001). In the retrospective clinical evaluation when comparing RNA copies/mL, the Ag-RDTs detected Alpha and Omicron (BA.1) more sensitively than the Delta VOC. Samples with high RT-qPCR Cts (Ct\u003e25) resulted in reduced test sensitivities across all variants. We used linear regression to model the 50% and 95% LOD of clinical samples and observed statistically similar results for all tests. In the prospective clinical samples, the sensitivity was statistically similar for the Delta VOC 71.9% (CI 95% 53.3-86.6%) and Omicron VOC 84.4% (CI95% 75.3-91.2%). InterpretationTest performance differs between SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and high sensitivity was achieved when testing the Omicron BA.5 VOC compared to the WHO Ag-RDT requirements. Continuous evaluations must be performed to monitor test performance.

L. A.; Jeewandara, C.; Ariyaratne, D.; Ramu, S. T.; Wijewickrama, A.; Ogg, G. S.; Malavige, G. N.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293412\nBackground As many studies have shown conflicting results regarding the extent of viraemia and clinical disease severity, we sought to investigate if viraemia during early dengue illness is associated with subsequent clinical disease severity. Methodology/Principal Findings 424 adult patients, in whom the dengue virus (DENV) serotype could be identified, who presented within the first 4 days of illness, were recruited from a tertiary care hospital from Sri Lanka from September 2016 to September 2022 following informed written consent. To characterize subsequent clinical disease severity, all patients were followed throughout their illness daily and disease severity classified according to WHO 1997 and 2009 disease classification. 315 patients had DF, 109 progressed to develop DHF and of those 17 developed shock (DSS). Although the viral loads were higher in the febrile phase in patients who progressed to develop DHF than in patients with DF this was not significant (p=0.15). Significant differences were observed in viral loads in patients infected with different DENV serotypes (p=0.0001), with patients infected with DENV2 having the lowest viral loads and the highest viral loads in DENV1. Although those infected with DENV2 had lower viral loads, infection with DENV2 was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing DHF (p=0.016, Odds ratio 1.8; 95% CI 1.116 to 2.905). Based on the WHO 2009 disease classification, 268 had dengue with warning signs (DWW), 139 dengue without warning signs (DWoWS), and 17 had severe dengue (SD). No significant difference was observed in the viral loads between those with SD, DWW and DWoWS (p=0.34). Conclusions/Significance Viral loads in the febrile phase do not appear to significantly associate with subsequent clinical disease severity in a large Sri Lankan cohort.\nA low-cost molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 detection suitable for variant discrimination and community testing using saliva\nAuthors: Silva, S. M.; Amaral, C.; Luis, C.; Grilo, D.; Duarte, A.; Morais, I.; Afonso, G.; Faria, N.; Antunes, W.; Gomes, I.; Sa-Leao, R.; Miragaia, M.; Serrano, M.; Pimentel, C.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292863\nThe gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing relies on RNA extraction from naso/oropharyngeal swab followed by amplification through RT-PCR with fluorogenic probes. While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes. In this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than {euro} 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2. To further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.\nIntegrating Mental Health and Psycho-Social Support (MHPSS) into infectious disease outbreak and epidemic response: an umbrella review and operational framework\nAuthors: Alkasaby, M.; Philip, S.; Douba, Z.; Tu, H.; Eaton, J.; Mohammed, M.; Essar, M. Y.; Kamal, M. A.; Adeel Riaz, M. M.; Moussallem, M.; Bosu, W. K.; Walker, I.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293219\nIntroductionInfectious disease outbreaks have a substantial impact on peoples psychosocial well-being. Yet, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions are not systemically integrated into outbreak and epidemic response. Our review aims to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of MHPSS interventions in outbreaks and propose a framework for systematically integrating MHPSS into outbreak response. MethodsWe conducted an umbrella review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews. ResultsWe identified 23 systematic literature reviews, 6 of which involved meta-analysis, and only 30% (n=7) were of high quality. Most of the available literature was produced during COVID-19 and focused on clinical case management and medical staff well- being, with scarce evidence on the well-being of other outbreak responders and MHPSS in other outbreak response pillars. ConclusionDespite the low quality of the majority of the existing evidence, MHPSS interventions have the potential to improve the psychological well- being of those affected by and those responding to outbreaks. They also can improve the outcomes of the outbreak response activities such as contact tracing, infection prevention and control, and clinical case management. Our proposed framework would facilitate integrating MHPSS into outbreak response and hence mitigate the mental health impact of outbreaks.

P.; Kori, L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293131\nBackgroundIndia is on track to eliminate malaria by 2030 but emerging resistance to the first-line antimalarials is a recognized threat. As Artesunate+Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) is the drug-of-choice for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in most of India, it becomes evident to systematically monitor the validated mutations in Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes across India. No systematic and robust countrywide surveillance has been reported for these parameters in India. MethodsWe included studies that reported data on SP-resistance markers in P. falciparum across India from 2008. Five major databases were exhaustively searched. Individual and pooled prevalence estimates of mutations were obtained through random- and fixed-effect models. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021236012). ResultsA total of 37 publications with data from 80 districts, 21 states and 3 UTs were included. The two PfDHFR mutations, C59R and S108N were the most prevalent mutations and appear to be stabilized/fixed. Although rarest overall, the prevalence of I164L was observed to be as high as 32%. The PfDHFR double mutants were the most prevalent overall. The prevalence of triple and quadruple mutations was 6% and 5%, respectively which is an area of immediate concern. For PfDHPS, the most prevalent mutation was A437G. For PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple and sextuple mutations, it was observed that despite a low overall prevalence of these mutations, some areas are critical for surveillance. ConclusionThe analysis brings forward the SP-resistance hot spots and emphasizes critical gaps, and challenges, and suggests focal and local malaria genetic surveillance (including drug resistance markers) till malaria is eliminated. Key pointsThis manuscript concludes that currently used first-line drugs for P. falciparum malaria, particularly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have a high likelihood of failing in near future. Although currently effective, the evidence is backed by molecular meta-analyses data on drug resistance markers in India. The policy makers and program managers may use this robust data to decide whether it is time to change these currently used anti-malarials in India before it is too late. It also identifies certain hot spots for continuous genetic monitoring of the molecular markers for timely actions.\nChronic Shedding of a SARS-CoV-2 Alpha Variant Lineage Q.3/Q.4 in Wastewater\nAuthors: Conway, M. J.; Yang, H.; Revord, L. A.; Ward, A. S.; Abel, J. D.; Williams, M. R.; Uzarski, R. L.; Alm, E. W.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293191\nCentral Michigan University (CMU) participated in a state-wide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring program since 2021. Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.\nEarly Biological Markers of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection\nAuthors: Lu, S.; Peluso, M.

Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.

        <p class="abstract">The etiologic mechanisms of post-acute medical morbidities and unexplained symptoms (Long COVID) following SARS-CoV-2 infection are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence and immune dysregulation may play a major role. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, [18F]F-AraG, a highly selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the post-acute COVID group, which included those with and without Long COVID symptoms, was significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic controls in many anatomical regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. Although T cell activation tended to be higher in participants imaged closer to the time of the acute illness, tracer uptake was increased in participants imaged up to 2.5 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that T cell activation in spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of Long COVID symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Notably, increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without Long COVID. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of participants with Long COVID symptoms. We identified cellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all these participants, ranging from 158 to 676 days following initial COVID-19 illness, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunological perturbations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with brain functional, structural, and cognitive changes that persist months after infection. Most studies of the neurologic outcomes related to COVID-19 focus on severe infection and aging populations. Here, we investigated the neural activities underlying COVID-19 related outcomes in a case-control study of mildly infected youth enrolled in a longitudinal study in Lombardy, Italy, a global hotspot of COVID-19. All participants (13 cases, 27 controls, mean age 24 years) completed resting state functional (fMRI), structural MRI, cognitive assessments (CANTAB spatial working memory) at baseline (pre-COVID) and follow-up (post-COVID). Using graph theory eigenvector centrality (EC) and data-driven statistical methods, we examined differences in ECdelta (i.e., the difference in EC values pre- and post-COVID-19) and volumetricdelta (i.e., the difference in cortical volume of cortical and subcortical areas pre- and post-COVID) between COVID-19 cases and controls. We found that ECdeltasignificantly between COVID-19 and healthy participants in five brain regions; right intracalcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus, left hippocampus, left amygdala, left frontal orbital cortex. The left hippocampus showed a significant decrease in volumetricdeltabetween groups (p=0.041). The reduced ECdelta in the right amygdala associated with COVID-19 status mediated the association between COVID-19 and disrupted spatial working memory. Our results show persistent structural, functional and cognitive brain changes in key brain areas associated with olfaction and cognition. These results may guide treatment efforts to assess the longevity, reversibility and impact of the observed brain and cognitive changes following COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human infection challenge permits characterisation of the associated immune response in unparalleled depth, enabling evaluation of early pre-symptomatic immune changes and the dynamic immune factors important for viral clearance. Here, 34 healthy young adult volunteers, seronegative to SARS-CoV-2, were inoculated with a D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2 strain. Nasal and systemic soluble mediator and antibody responses, and peripheral blood T cell and B cell responses were measured by MesoScale Discovery and flow cytometry just before and up to 1 year after intra-nasal inoculation. In the 18 (53%) participants who became infected, both nasal and systemic mediator responses were dominated by interferons (IFN) but with divergent kinetics. T cell activation and proliferation in blood peaked at day 10 in CD4&#43; T cells and day 14 in CD8&#43; T cells, returning to baseline by day 28. Following infection, antigen-specific T cells were largely CD38&#43;Ki67&#43; and displayed central and effector memory phenotypes. T cells contracted after viral clearance with expanded antigen-specific memory T cell populations persisting past day 28. Both mucosal and systemic antibodies became detectable around day 10 but nasal antibodies plateaued after day 14 while circulating antibodies continued to rise. Using piecewise linear regression modelling, viral load related closely to the induction of type I IFN responses, moreover, CD8&#43; T cell responses and early IgA responses were strongly associated with viral clearance. Detailed analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection following human challenge thus revealed the relationship between immune kinetics and viral load as factors associated with resolution of infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires timely analytical and clinical evaluation of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) especially those that are recommended for at home use.

MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) of 34 Ag-RDTs was evaluated using the most encountered SARS-CoV-2 VOC viral isolates (Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.5) and the wild type (WT). Clinical sensitivity was further evaluated for five Ag-RDT utilising retrospective samples (Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1) and one Ag-RDT utilising prospective clinical samples (Delta and Omicron BA.1).

FindingsFor the WT, Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron (BA.1) variants 22, 32, 29, 31 and 32 of the 34 Ag-RDTs evaluated met the World Health Organisations (WHO) target product profile (TPP), respectively. Of the 31 Ag-RDTs included for Omicron BA.5 evaluation 29 met the WHO TPP. Additionally, the LODs for samples spiked with Omicron BA.5 were significantly lower than all other VOCs included (p&lt;0.001). In the retrospective clinical evaluation when comparing RNA copies/mL, the Ag-RDTs detected Alpha and Omicron (BA.1) more sensitively than the Delta VOC. Samples with high RT-qPCR Cts (Ct&gt;25) resulted in reduced test sensitivities across all variants. We used linear regression to model the 50% and 95% LOD of clinical samples and observed statistically similar results for all tests. In the prospective clinical samples, the sensitivity was statistically similar for the Delta VOC 71.9% (CI 95% 53.3-86.6%) and Omicron VOC 84.4% (CI95% 75.3-91.2%).

InterpretationTest performance differs between SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and high sensitivity was achieved when testing the Omicron BA.5 VOC compared to the WHO Ag-RDT requirements. Continuous evaluations must be performed to monitor test performance.

        <p class="abstract">Background As many studies have shown conflicting results regarding the extent of viraemia and clinical disease severity, we sought to investigate if viraemia during early dengue illness is associated with subsequent clinical disease severity. Methodology/Principal Findings 424 adult patients, in whom the dengue virus (DENV) serotype could be identified, who presented within the first 4 days of illness, were recruited from a tertiary care hospital from Sri Lanka from September 2016 to September 2022 following informed written consent. To characterize subsequent clinical disease severity, all patients were followed throughout their illness daily and disease severity classified according to WHO 1997 and 2009 disease classification. 315 patients had DF, 109 progressed to develop DHF and of those 17 developed shock (DSS). Although the viral loads were higher in the febrile phase in patients who progressed to develop DHF than in patients with DF this was not significant (p=0.15). Significant differences were observed in viral loads in patients infected with different DENV serotypes (p=0.0001), with patients infected with DENV2 having the lowest viral loads and the highest viral loads in DENV1. Although those infected with DENV2 had lower viral loads, infection with DENV2 was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing DHF (p=0.016, Odds ratio 1.8; 95% CI 1.116 to 2.905). Based on the WHO 2009 disease classification, 268 had dengue with warning signs (DWW), 139 dengue without warning signs (DWoWS), and 17 had severe dengue (SD). No significant difference was observed in the viral loads between those with SD, DWW and DWoWS (p=0.34). Conclusions/Significance Viral loads in the febrile phase do not appear to significantly associate with subsequent clinical disease severity in a large Sri Lankan cohort.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing relies on RNA extraction from naso/oropharyngeal swab followed by amplification through RT-PCR with fluorogenic probes. While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes.

In this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than {euro} 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2.

To further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionInfectious disease outbreaks have a substantial impact on peoples psychosocial well-being. Yet, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions are not systemically integrated into outbreak and epidemic response. Our review aims to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of MHPSS interventions in outbreaks and propose a framework for systematically integrating MHPSS into outbreak response.

MethodsWe conducted an umbrella review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews.

ResultsWe identified 23 systematic literature reviews, 6 of which involved meta-analysis, and only 30% (n=7) were of high quality. Most of the available literature was produced during COVID-19 and focused on clinical case management and medical staff well- being, with scarce evidence on the well-being of other outbreak responders and MHPSS in other outbreak response pillars.

ConclusionDespite the low quality of the majority of the existing evidence, MHPSS interventions have the potential to improve the psychological well- being of those affected by and those responding to outbreaks. They also can improve the outcomes of the outbreak response activities such as contact tracing, infection prevention and control, and clinical case management. Our proposed framework would facilitate integrating MHPSS into outbreak response and hence mitigate the mental health impact of outbreaks.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia is on track to eliminate malaria by 2030 but emerging resistance to the first-line antimalarials is a recognized threat. As Artesunate&#43;Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS&#43;SP) is the drug-of-choice for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in most of India, it becomes evident to systematically monitor the validated mutations in Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes across India. No systematic and robust countrywide surveillance has been reported for these parameters in India.

MethodsWe included studies that reported data on SP-resistance markers in P. falciparum across India from 2008. Five major databases were exhaustively searched. Individual and pooled prevalence estimates of mutations were obtained through random- and fixed-effect models. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021236012).

ResultsA total of 37 publications with data from 80 districts, 21 states and 3 UTs were included. The two PfDHFR mutations, C59R and S108N were the most prevalent mutations and appear to be stabilized/fixed. Although rarest overall, the prevalence of I164L was observed to be as high as 32%. The PfDHFR double mutants were the most prevalent overall. The prevalence of triple and quadruple mutations was 6% and 5%, respectively which is an area of immediate concern. For PfDHPS, the most prevalent mutation was A437G. For PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple and sextuple mutations, it was observed that despite a low overall prevalence of these mutations, some areas are critical for surveillance.

ConclusionThe analysis brings forward the SP-resistance hot spots and emphasizes critical gaps, and challenges, and suggests focal and local malaria genetic surveillance (including drug resistance markers) till malaria is eliminated.

Key pointsThis manuscript concludes that currently used first-line drugs for P. falciparum malaria, particularly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have a high likelihood of failing in near future. Although currently effective, the evidence is backed by molecular meta-analyses data on drug resistance markers in India. The policy makers and program managers may use this robust data to decide whether it is time to change these currently used anti-malarials in India before it is too late. It also identifies certain hot spots for continuous genetic monitoring of the molecular markers for timely actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Central Michigan University (CMU) participated in a state-wide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring program since 2021. Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.
