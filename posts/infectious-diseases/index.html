A.\nScore: 259.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nFace masks to control the source of respiratory infections: A systematic review of the scientific literature before and after COVID-19\nAuthors: Prasad, V.; Brown, E. M.; Haslam, A.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296616\nObjectiveTo examine the scientific literature on mask-use as source control to protect others from respiratory infections before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. DesignSystematic review. MethodsWe examined primary research on mask usage as a means of source control to protect others by reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and contrasted the literature published before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with that published afterward. Articles were obtained through a search of PubMed and a review of article references. March 1, 2020 was selected as the cutoff date to distinguish between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods. Results195 articles met our inclusion criteria. The sample included 55 articles on source control published before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 140 articles published after the pandemic began, representing a 154.5% increase. The percentage of randomized control trials (RCT) and cluster RCTs declined by 94.9% (p\u003c0.001), representing only 1.4% of the post-pandemic literature. The percentage of studies conducted on human subjects declined by 48.8% (p\u003c0.001), and the percentage of studies in healthcare facilities declined by 64.5% (p=0.019). One in 5 post-pandemic studies (21.4%) were conducted in \"real world\" settings; 1 in 10 post-pandemic studies (10.0%) were done with computer modeling. Study authors were significantly more supportive of masks as source control in the post-pandemic literature. ConclusionsThe quality of evidence in the published literature on masks as source control is lower after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with notable shifts in methodologies, research subjects, setting, and author tone.\nSocioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake among children and adolescents in Catalonia, Spain\nAuthors: Lopez-Sanchez, I.; Perramon, A.; Soriano-Arandes, A.; Prats, C.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Raventos, B.; Roel, E.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297134\nIMPORTANCEThe relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear. OBJECTIVETo investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain. DESIGN AND SETTINGPopulation-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children. PARTICIPANTSChildren (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data. EXPOSUREDeprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESCOVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1. RESULTSBefore COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIn this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.\nSome principles for using epidemiologic study results to parameterize transmission models\nAuthors: Joshi, K.; Kahn, R.; Boyer, C.; Lipsitch, M.\nScore: 46.9, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296455\nBackgroundInfectious disease models, including individual based models (IBMs), can be used to inform public health response. For these models to be effective, accurate estimates of key parameters describing the natural history of infection and disease are needed. However, obtaining these parameter estimates from epidemiological studies is not always straightforward. We aim to 1) outline challenges to parameter estimation that arise due to common biases found in epidemiologic studies and 2) describe the conditions under which careful consideration in the design and analysis of the study could allow us to obtain a causal estimate of the parameter of interest. In this discussion we do not focus on issues of generalizability and transportability. MethodsUsing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic, we first identify different ways of parameterizing IBMs and describe ideal study designs to estimate these parameters. Given real-world limitations, we describe challenges in parameter estimation due to confounding and conditioning on a post-exposure observation. We then describe ideal study designs that can lead to unbiased parameter estimates. We finally discuss additional challenges in estimating progression probabilities and the consequences of these challenges. ResultsCausal estimation can only occur if we are able to accurately measure and control for all confounding variables that create non-causal associations between the exposure and outcome of interest, which is sometimes challenging given the nature of the variables we need to measure. In the absence of perfect control, non-causal parameter estimates should still be used, as sometimes they are the best available information we have. ConclusionsIdentifying which estimates from epidemiologic studies correspond to the quantities needed to parameterize disease models, and determining whether these parameters have causal interpretations, can inform future study designs and improve inferences from infectious disease models. Understanding the way in which biases can arise in parameter estimation can inform sensitivity analyses or help with interpretation of results if the magnitude and direction of the bias is understood.\nSurveillance and Stability of SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Samples in Minnesota\nAuthors: Osborn, M.; Champeau, S.; Meyer, C.; Hayden, M.; Landini, L.; Stark, S.; Preeket, S.; Vetter, S.; Lynfield, R.; Huff, D.; Schacker, T.; Doss, C. R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.23296666\nWastewater-based epidemiology provides an approach for assessing the prevalence of pathogens such as COVID-19 in a sewer service area. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured serially in 44 wastewater treatment plants of varying service capacities comprising approximately 67% of the population of Minnesota, from September 2020 through December 2022. We employed linear regression models to establish a predictive relationship between the weekly SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater and clinical case counts. Metrics were assessed under specified transformation and normalization methods which we confirmed by cross-validation averaged across the enrolled treatment plants. We report that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may be treatment plant-specific. Toward establishing guidelines for pathogen surveillance, we further studied storage and time-to-analysis for RNA wastewater data and observed large effects of storage temperature, indicating that collection methods may have an important effect on the utility and validity of wastewater data for infectious disease monitoring. Our findings are additive for any large-scale wastewater surveillance program.\nImpact of sampling site on diagnostic test accuracy of RT-PCR in diagnosing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection since the emergence of omicron: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saal-Bauernschubert, L.; Wagner, C.; Fomenko, A.; Daehne, T.; Bora, A.-M.; Janka, H.; Stangl, S.; Skoetz, N.; Weibel, S.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296728\nNasopharyngeal sampling (NP) is the routine standard for SASR-CoV-2 detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this systematic review, we assessed diagnostic test accuracy of alternative sampling sites compared to NP for RT-PCR testing of Omicron (sub)-variants. We systematically searched for studies from January 2022 until February 2023 investigating any type of respiratory sample for RT-PCR in people with suspected, known, or known absence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE. We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low. Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.\nEarly syphilis in Guangzhou, China: presentation, molecular detection of Treponema pallidum, and genomic sequences in clinical specimens and isolates obtained by rabbit infectivity testing\nAuthors: Yang, L.; Zhang, X.; Chen, W.; Sena, A. C.; Zheng, H.; Jiang, Y.; Zhao, P.; Chen, R.; Wang, L.; Ke, W.; Salazar, J. C.; Parr, J. B.; Turker, J. D.; Hawley, K. L.; Caimano, M. J.; Hennelly, C. M.; Aghakanian, F.; Zhang, F.; Chen, J. S.; Moody, M. A.; Radolf, J. D.; Yang, B.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297169\nBackgroundThe global resurgence of syphilis requires novel prevention strategies. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Treponema pallidum (TPA) using different specimen types is essential for vaccine development. MethodsPatients with primary (PS) and secondary (SS) syphilis were recruited in Guangzhou, China. We collected ulcer exudates and blood from PS participants, and skin biopsies and blood from SS participants for TPA polA polymerase chain reaction (PCR); ulcer exudates and blood were also used to isolate TPA strains by rabbit infectivity testing (RIT). TPA WGS was performed on 52 ulcer exudates and biopsy specimens and 25 matched rabbit isolates. ResultsWe enrolled 18 PS and 51 SS participants from December 2019 to March 2022. Among PS participants, TPA DNA was detected in 16 (89%) ulcer exudates and three (17%) blood specimens. Among SS participants, TPA DNA was detected in 50 (98%) skin biopsies and 27 (53%) blood specimens. TPA was isolated from 48 rabbits, with a 71% (12/17) success rate from ulcer exudates and 69% (36/52) from SS bloods. Twenty-three matched SS14 clade genomes were virtually identical, while two Nichols clade pairs had discordant tprK sequences. Forty-two of 52 unique TPA genomes clustered in an SS14 East Asia subgroup, while ten fell into two East Asian Nichols subgroups. ConclusionsOur TPA detection rate was high from PS ulcer exudates and SS skin biopsies and over 50% from SS whole blood, with RIT isolation in over two-thirds of samples. Our results support the use of WGS from rabbit isolates to inform vaccine development. SummaryWe performed Treponema pallidum molecular detection and genome sequencing from multiple specimens collected from early syphilis patients and isolates obtained by rabbit inoculation. Our results support the use of whole genome sequencing from rabbit isolates to inform syphilis vaccine development.\nHigh prevalence and risk of malaria among asymptomatic individuals from villages with high rates of artemisinin partial resistance in Kyerwa district, North-western Tanzania.\nAuthors: Mandai, S. S.; Francis, F.; Challe, D. P.; Seth, M. D.; Madebe, R. A.; Petro, D. A.; Budodo, R.; Kisambale, A. J.; Chacha, G. A.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Pereus, D.; Bakari, C.; Aaron, S.; Mbwambo, D.; Lusasi, A.; Kajange, S.; Lazaro, S.; Kapologwe, N.; Mandara, C. I.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296564\nBackgroundTanzania adopted and has been implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended interventions to control and eventually eliminate malaria. However, malaria is still a leading public health problem and the country experiences heterogeneous transmission; but the drivers of these patterns are not clearly known. This study assessed the prevalence and risk of malaria infections among asymptomatic individuals living in a hyperendemic area which has high prevalence of artemisinin partial resistant parasites in Kyerwa District of Kagera region, North-western Tanzania. MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional survey that recruited participants from five villages of Kyerwa district in Kagera region. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, parasitological, types of houses inhabited and socio-economic status (SES) data were collected using electronic capture tools running on Open Data Kit (ODK). Risk factors associated with malaria infections were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression and the results were presented as crude (cOR) and adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ResultsA total of 4,454 individuals were tested using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and 1,979 (44.4%) had a positive test. The prevalence of malaria varied from 14.4% to 68.5% with significant differences among the villages (p\u003c0.001). The prevalence and risk of malaria infections were significantly higher in males (aOR =1.25, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.48, p=0.04), school children ((aged 5 - 10 years, aOR =4.09, 95% CI: 3.39 - 5.10, p\u003c0.001) and (10-15 years, aOR=4.40, 95% CI: 3.46 - 5.59, p\u003c0.001)) and among individuals who were not using bed nets (aOR =1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.42, p=0.002). Other risks of malaria infections included lower SES (aOR=1.27, 95% CI:1.04 - 1.55, p\u003c0.001) and living in houses with open windows (aOR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.03 -1.54, p=0.024). ConclusionThis study showed high prevalence of malaria infections and high heterogeneity at micro-geographic levels. The risk of malaria infections was higher in school children, males, individuals who did not use bed nets, and among participants with low SES or living in poorly constructed houses. These findings provide important baseline data in an area with a high prevalence of artemisinin partial-resistant parasites and will be utilized in future studies to monitor the trends and potential spread of such parasites.\nSeroincidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and during the rollout of vaccines in a community-based prospective cohort of U.S. adults\nAuthors: Nash, D.; Srivastava, A.; Shen, Y.; Penrose, K.; Kulkarni, S.; Zimba, R.; You, W.; Berry, A.; Mirzayi, C.; Maroko, A. R.; Parcesepe, A.; Grov, C.; Robertson, M.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296142\nLONG ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSInfectious disease surveillance systems, which largely rely on diagnosed cases, underestimate the true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to under-ascertainment and underreporting. We used repeat serologic testing to measure N-protein seroconversion in a well-characterized cohort of U.S. adults with no serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterize risk factors, with comparisons before and after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and variant eras. MethodsWe assessed the incidence rate of infection and risk factors in two sub-groups (cohorts) that were SARS-CoV-2 N-protein seronegative at the start of each follow-up period: 1) the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort (n=3,421), followed from April to November 2020; and 2) the vaccine/variant era cohort (n=2,735), followed from November 2020 to June 2022. Both cohorts underwent repeat serologic testing with an assay for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Bio-Rad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 total Ab). We estimated crude incidence and sociodemographic/epidemiologic risk factors in both cohorts. We used multivariate Poisson models to compare the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort (referent group) to that in the vaccine/variant era cohort, within strata of vaccination status and epidemiologic risk factors (essential worker status, child in the household, case in the household, social distancing). FindingsIn the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort, only 18 of the 3,421 participants (0.53%) had \u003e1 vaccine dose by the end of follow-up, compared with 2,497/2,735 (91.3%) in the vaccine/variant era cohort. We observed 323 and 815 seroconversions in the pre-vaccine/wild-type era and the vaccine/variant era and cohorts, respectively, with corresponding incidence rates of 9.6 (95% CI: 8.3-11.5) and 25.7 (95% CI: 24.2-27.3) per 100 person-years. Associations of sociodemographic and epidemiologic risk factors with SARS-CoV-2 incidence were largely similar in the pre-vaccine/wild-type and vaccine/variant era cohorts. However, some new epidemiologic risk factors emerged in the vaccine/variant era cohort, including having a child in the household, and never wearing a mask while using public transit. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR), with the entire pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort as the referent group, showed markedly higher incidence in the vaccine/variant era cohort, but with more vaccine doses associated with lower incidence: aIRRun/undervaccinated=5.3 (95% CI: 4.2-6.7); aIRRprimary series only=5.1 (95% CI: 4.2-7.3); aIRRboosted once=2.5 (95% CI: 2.1-3.0), and aIRRboosted twice=1.65 (95% CI: 1.3-2.1). These associations were essentially unchanged in risk factor-stratified models. InterpretationIn SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative individuals, large increases in incidence and newly emerging epidemiologic risk factors in the vaccine/variant era likely resulted from multiple co-occurring factors, including policy changes, behavior changes, surges in transmission, and changes in SARS-CoV-2 variant properties. While SARS-CoV-2 incidence increased markedly in most groups in the vaccine/variant era, being up to date on vaccines and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as masking and social distancing, remained reliable strategies to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even through major surges due to immune evasive variants. Repeat serologic testing in cohort studies is a useful and complementary strategy to characterize SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk factors. SHORT ABSTRACTThis study used repeat serologic testing to estimate infection rates and risk factors in two overlapping cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative U.S. adults. One mostly unvaccinated sub-cohort was tracked from April to November 2020 (pre-vaccine/wild-type era, n=3,421), and the other, mostly vaccinated cohort, from November 2020 to June 2022 (vaccine/variant era, n=2,735). Vaccine uptake was from 0.53% and 91.3% in the pre-vaccine and vaccine/variant cohorts, respectively. Corresponding seroconversion rates were 9.6 and 25.7 per 100 person-years. In both cohorts, sociodemographic and epidemiologic risk factors for infection were similar, though new risks emerged in the vaccine/variant era, such as having a child in the household. Despite higher incidence rates in the vaccine/variant cohort, vaccine boosters, masking, and distancing likely reduced infection risk, even through major variant surges. Repeat serologic testing in cohorts is a useful and complementary strategy to characterize incidence and risk factors.

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the scientific literature on mask-use as source control to protect others from respiratory infections before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignSystematic review.

MethodsWe examined primary research on mask usage as a means of source control to protect others by reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and contrasted the literature published before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with that published afterward. Articles were obtained through a search of PubMed and a review of article references. March 1, 2020 was selected as the cutoff date to distinguish between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods.

Results195 articles met our inclusion criteria. The sample included 55 articles on source control published before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 140 articles published after the pandemic began, representing a 154.5% increase. The percentage of randomized control trials (RCT) and cluster RCTs declined by 94.9% (p&lt;0.001), representing only 1.4% of the post-pandemic literature. The percentage of studies conducted on human subjects declined by 48.8% (p&lt;0.001), and the percentage of studies in healthcare facilities declined by 64.5% (p=0.019). One in 5 post-pandemic studies (21.4%) were conducted in &#34;real world&#34; settings; 1 in 10 post-pandemic studies (10.0%) were done with computer modeling. Study authors were significantly more supportive of masks as source control in the post-pandemic literature.

ConclusionsThe quality of evidence in the published literature on masks as source control is lower after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with notable shifts in methodologies, research subjects, setting, and author tone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IMPORTANCEThe relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain.

DESIGN AND SETTINGPopulation-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children.

PARTICIPANTSChildren (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data.

EXPOSUREDeprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESCOVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1.

RESULTSBefore COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIn this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInfectious disease models, including individual based models (IBMs), can be used to inform public health response. For these models to be effective, accurate estimates of key parameters describing the natural history of infection and disease are needed. However, obtaining these parameter estimates from epidemiological studies is not always straightforward. We aim to 1) outline challenges to parameter estimation that arise due to common biases found in epidemiologic studies and 2) describe the conditions under which careful consideration in the design and analysis of the study could allow us to obtain a causal estimate of the parameter of interest. In this discussion we do not focus on issues of generalizability and transportability.

MethodsUsing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic, we first identify different ways of parameterizing IBMs and describe ideal study designs to estimate these parameters. Given real-world limitations, we describe challenges in parameter estimation due to confounding and conditioning on a post-exposure observation. We then describe ideal study designs that can lead to unbiased parameter estimates. We finally discuss additional challenges in estimating progression probabilities and the consequences of these challenges.

ResultsCausal estimation can only occur if we are able to accurately measure and control for all confounding variables that create non-causal associations between the exposure and outcome of interest, which is sometimes challenging given the nature of the variables we need to measure. In the absence of perfect control, non-causal parameter estimates should still be used, as sometimes they are the best available information we have.

ConclusionsIdentifying which estimates from epidemiologic studies correspond to the quantities needed to parameterize disease models, and determining whether these parameters have causal interpretations, can inform future study designs and improve inferences from infectious disease models. Understanding the way in which biases can arise in parameter estimation can inform sensitivity analyses or help with interpretation of results if the magnitude and direction of the bias is understood.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology provides an approach for assessing the prevalence of pathogens such as COVID-19 in a sewer service area. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured serially in 44 wastewater treatment plants of varying service capacities comprising approximately 67% of the population of Minnesota, from September 2020 through December 2022. We employed linear regression models to establish a predictive relationship between the weekly SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater and clinical case counts. Metrics were assessed under specified transformation and normalization methods which we confirmed by cross-validation averaged across the enrolled treatment plants. We report that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may be treatment plant-specific. Toward establishing guidelines for pathogen surveillance, we further studied storage and time-to-analysis for RNA wastewater data and observed large effects of storage temperature, indicating that collection methods may have an important effect on the utility and validity of wastewater data for infectious disease monitoring. Our findings are additive for any large-scale wastewater surveillance program.</p>

Data were pooled for each comparison using the bivariate model, sensitivity and specificity was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2 tool, certainty of evidence with GRADE.

We included three cohort-type cross-sectional studies (1,003 participants). Saliva versus NP sampling in three studies showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 83% to 98%). AN versus NP sampling in one study showed a sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Certainty of evidence for sensitivity and specificity of both comparisons was low to very low.

Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about accuracy of different sampling sites for RT-PCR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe global resurgence of syphilis requires novel prevention strategies. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Treponema pallidum (TPA) using different specimen types is essential for vaccine development.

MethodsPatients with primary (PS) and secondary (SS) syphilis were recruited in Guangzhou, China. We collected ulcer exudates and blood from PS participants, and skin biopsies and blood from SS participants for TPA polA polymerase chain reaction (PCR); ulcer exudates and blood were also used to isolate TPA strains by rabbit infectivity testing (RIT). TPA WGS was performed on 52 ulcer exudates and biopsy specimens and 25 matched rabbit isolates.

ResultsWe enrolled 18 PS and 51 SS participants from December 2019 to March 2022. Among PS participants, TPA DNA was detected in 16 (89%) ulcer exudates and three (17%) blood specimens. Among SS participants, TPA DNA was detected in 50 (98%) skin biopsies and 27 (53%) blood specimens. TPA was isolated from 48 rabbits, with a 71% (12/17) success rate from ulcer exudates and 69% (36/52) from SS bloods. Twenty-three matched SS14 clade genomes were virtually identical, while two Nichols clade pairs had discordant tprK sequences. Forty-two of 52 unique TPA genomes clustered in an SS14 East Asia subgroup, while ten fell into two East Asian Nichols subgroups.

ConclusionsOur TPA detection rate was high from PS ulcer exudates and SS skin biopsies and over 50% from SS whole blood, with RIT isolation in over two-thirds of samples. Our results support the use of WGS from rabbit isolates to inform vaccine development.

SummaryWe performed Treponema pallidum molecular detection and genome sequencing from multiple specimens collected from early syphilis patients and isolates obtained by rabbit inoculation. Our results support the use of whole genome sequencing from rabbit isolates to inform syphilis vaccine development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTanzania adopted and has been implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended interventions to control and eventually eliminate malaria. However, malaria is still a leading public health problem and the country experiences heterogeneous transmission; but the drivers of these patterns are not clearly known. This study assessed the prevalence and risk of malaria infections among asymptomatic individuals living in a hyperendemic area which has high prevalence of artemisinin partial resistant parasites in Kyerwa District of Kagera region, North-western Tanzania.

MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional survey that recruited participants from five villages of Kyerwa district in Kagera region. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, parasitological, types of houses inhabited and socio-economic status (SES) data were collected using electronic capture tools running on Open Data Kit (ODK). Risk factors associated with malaria infections were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression and the results were presented as crude (cOR) and adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

ResultsA total of 4,454 individuals were tested using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and 1,979 (44.4%) had a positive test. The prevalence of malaria varied from 14.4% to 68.5% with significant differences among the villages (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence and risk of malaria infections were significantly higher in males (aOR =1.25, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.48, p=0.04), school children ((aged 5 - 10 years, aOR =4.09, 95% CI: 3.39 - 5.10, p&lt;0.001) and (10-15 years, aOR=4.40, 95% CI: 3.46 - 5.59, p&lt;0.001)) and among individuals who were not using bed nets (aOR =1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.42, p=0.002). Other risks of malaria infections included lower SES (aOR=1.27, 95% CI:1.04 - 1.55, p&lt;0.001) and living in houses with open windows (aOR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.03 -1.54, p=0.024).

ConclusionThis study showed high prevalence of malaria infections and high heterogeneity at micro-geographic levels. The risk of malaria infections was higher in school children, males, individuals who did not use bed nets, and among participants with low SES or living in poorly constructed houses. These findings provide important baseline data in an area with a high prevalence of artemisinin partial-resistant parasites and will be utilized in future studies to monitor the trends and potential spread of such parasites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">LONG ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSInfectious disease surveillance systems, which largely rely on diagnosed cases, underestimate the true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to under-ascertainment and underreporting. We used repeat serologic testing to measure N-protein seroconversion in a well-characterized cohort of U.S. adults with no serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterize risk factors, with comparisons before and after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and variant eras.

MethodsWe assessed the incidence rate of infection and risk factors in two sub-groups (cohorts) that were SARS-CoV-2 N-protein seronegative at the start of each follow-up period: 1) the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort (n=3,421), followed from April to November 2020; and 2) the vaccine/variant era cohort (n=2,735), followed from November 2020 to June 2022. Both cohorts underwent repeat serologic testing with an assay for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Bio-Rad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 total Ab). We estimated crude incidence and sociodemographic/epidemiologic risk factors in both cohorts. We used multivariate Poisson models to compare the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort (referent group) to that in the vaccine/variant era cohort, within strata of vaccination status and epidemiologic risk factors (essential worker status, child in the household, case in the household, social distancing).

FindingsIn the pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort, only 18 of the 3,421 participants (0.53%) had &gt;1 vaccine dose by the end of follow-up, compared with 2,497/2,735 (91.3%) in the vaccine/variant era cohort. We observed 323 and 815 seroconversions in the pre-vaccine/wild-type era and the vaccine/variant era and cohorts, respectively, with corresponding incidence rates of 9.6 (95% CI: 8.3-11.5) and 25.7 (95% CI: 24.2-27.3) per 100 person-years. Associations of sociodemographic and epidemiologic risk factors with SARS-CoV-2 incidence were largely similar in the pre-vaccine/wild-type and vaccine/variant era cohorts. However, some new epidemiologic risk factors emerged in the vaccine/variant era cohort, including having a child in the household, and never wearing a mask while using public transit. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR), with the entire pre-vaccine/wild-type era cohort as the referent group, showed markedly higher incidence in the vaccine/variant era cohort, but with more vaccine doses associated with lower incidence: aIRRun/undervaccinated=5.3 (95% CI: 4.2-6.7); aIRRprimary series only=5.1 (95% CI: 4.2-7.3); aIRRboosted once=2.5 (95% CI: 2.1-3.0), and aIRRboosted twice=1.65 (95% CI: 1.3-2.1). These associations were essentially unchanged in risk factor-stratified models.

InterpretationIn SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative individuals, large increases in incidence and newly emerging epidemiologic risk factors in the vaccine/variant era likely resulted from multiple co-occurring factors, including policy changes, behavior changes, surges in transmission, and changes in SARS-CoV-2 variant properties. While SARS-CoV-2 incidence increased markedly in most groups in the vaccine/variant era, being up to date on vaccines and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as masking and social distancing, remained reliable strategies to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even through major surges due to immune evasive variants. Repeat serologic testing in cohort studies is a useful and complementary strategy to characterize SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk factors.

SHORT ABSTRACTThis study used repeat serologic testing to estimate infection rates and risk factors in two overlapping cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative U.S. adults. One mostly unvaccinated sub-cohort was tracked from April to November 2020 (pre-vaccine/wild-type era, n=3,421), and the other, mostly vaccinated cohort, from November 2020 to June 2022 (vaccine/variant era, n=2,735). Vaccine uptake was from 0.53% and 91.3% in the pre-vaccine and vaccine/variant cohorts, respectively. Corresponding seroconversion rates were 9.6 and 25.7 per 100 person-years. In both cohorts, sociodemographic and epidemiologic risk factors for infection were similar, though new risks emerged in the vaccine/variant era, such as having a child in the household. Despite higher incidence rates in the vaccine/variant cohort, vaccine boosters, masking, and distancing likely reduced infection risk, even through major variant surges. Repeat serologic testing in cohorts is a useful and complementary strategy to characterize incidence and risk factors.
