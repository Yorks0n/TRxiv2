M.\nScore: 1757.3, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298565\nAdverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P\u003c.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P\u003c.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P\u003c.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P\u003c.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P\u003c.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P\u003c.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.\nEffectiveness and durability of mRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine (mRNA-1273.222) against SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 and XBB sublineages\nAuthors: Ackerson, B. K.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Qian, L.; Sy, L. S.; Qiu, S.; Tubert, J. E.; Lee, G. S.; Ku, J. H.; Florea, A.; Luo, Y.; Bathala, R.; Stern, J.; Choi, S. K.; Takhar, H. S.; Aragones, M.; Marks, M. A.; Anderson, E. J.; Zhou, C. K.; Sun, T.; Talarico, C. A.; Tseng, H. F.\nScore: 90.3, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299663\nBackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for \u003e1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines. MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [\u0026ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization. ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses. ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.\nThe spectrum of non-fatal immune-related adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination: The population-based cohort study in Seoul, South Korea\nAuthors: Suh, J. H.; Kim, H. J.; Kim, M.-H.; Choi, M. G.; Chun, E. M.\nScore: 538.2, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298566\nObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination. ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs. ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.\nInforming the need for a SARS-CoV-2 booster based upon the immune response among young healthy adults to variants circulating during late 2023\nAuthors: Nguyen, H. C.; Lal, K. G.; Balinsky, C. A.; Smith, L.; Pan, L.; Cheng, Y.; Fox, I.; Hontz, R. D.; Lizewski, S. E.; Foo, H. S.; Krebs, S. J.; Sun, P.; Letizia, A. G.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300003\nCOVID-19 remains a global public health challenge due to ongoing emergence of new immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, heterogeneous immunity, poor education campaigns, and suboptimal surveillance. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the adaptive immune responses in US active-duty service members who completed a COVID-19 primary vaccine series to 3 previously dominant variants (Ancestral, Delta, BA.5) and compared them to 3 variants currently circulating (XBB.1.5, EG.5, and BA.2.86). Analyses were performed based upon time (within or beyond 12 months) and type (vaccine or infection) of most recent exposure. Significant reduction was observed in binding antibodies, neutralization antibodies, memory B cells, and CD8+ T cells against current circulating variants compared to previous dominant variants. The reduction in antibody response was more pronounced in those whose most recent exposure, regardless if vaccination or infection, was greater than 12 months from study enrollment. In contrast, the CD4+ T cell response was largely consistent across all tested variants. Our study did not show that the type exposure in the last 12 months was a significant factor in determining the magnitude of immune responses. However, the antibody responses to circulating variants were decreased among participants who received the bivalent booster compared to those with an infection in the past 12 months, potentially due to immunological imprinting of the Ancestral strain. Administration of the new XBB.1.5-based booster is likely to enhance cross-reactive humoral immune responses against current SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains.\nSARS-CoV-2 serosurvey across multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City between 2020-2023\nAuthors: Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Wagner, A.; Monahan, B.; Floda, D.; Gonzalez-Reiche, A. S.; Tcheou, J.; Raskin, A.; Bielak, D.; Singh, G.; Morris, S.; Fried, M.; Yellin, T.; Sullivan, L.; Study Group, P.; Sordillo, E. M.; Gordon, A.; van Bakel, H.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300131\nSero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels \u003e90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.\nFungal pleural infection due to Microascus gracilis with pulmonary aspergillosis after COVID-19 pneumonia\nAuthors: Hu, Z.; Mao, L.; Deng, T.; Su, B.; Yang, Y.; Dong, B.; Xu, Q.; Yang, S.\nScore: 81.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23298951\nAbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSScopulariopsis/Microascus is a rare but devastating pathogen due to its intrinsic resistance to nearly all available antifungal agents. Microascus gracilis, an ascomycetous mould in the order Microascales, family Microascaceae, has recently emerged as a significant invasive pathogen causing opportunistic infections. Objectives and MethodsWe present a case of pleural infection caused by M. gracilis with pulmonary aspergillosis in an immunocompromised man after COVID-19 pneumonia. To further understand the characteristics of the pathogen isolated from the patient, we identified the strain through mycological characteristics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based sequencing, and performed in vitro drug susceptibility testing against common antifungal agents. Moreover, we assessed lymphocyte subsets and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression in peripheral blood and pleural effusion to monitor the efficacy of therapy with thymosin--1 and intravenous immunoglobulin. ResultsFilamentous fungi isolated from pleural fluid were identified as M. gracilis based on classical morphology, mass spectrometry and molecular biology methods. The susceptibility results in vitro revealed that multiple antifungal agents were inactive against the strain. Adjuvant immunomodulatory treatment successfully increased the levels of CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells while decreasing the levels of CD3+PD-1+ and CD4+PD-1+ T cells in both peripheral blood and pleural effusion. ConclusionsThe immunocompromised host with opportunistic M. gracilis infection, rapid and accurate recognition through direct microscopic testing with calcofluor white and MOLDI-TOF MS, is the key to achieving a definite diagnosis, and a combination of antifungal therapy with immunomodulatory therapy is vital for improving survival.\nEmergence and predominance of novel influenza A (H3N2) subclade (3C.2a1b.2a.2a.3a.1) in Kenya and globally in 2023\nAuthors: Morobe, J.

P.; Seroprevalence Study Group, ; Tang, T. K.; Townsend, A.; Ogg, G. S.; Malavige, G. N.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300176\nBackground: We investigated the seropositivity rates of Sri Lankan children in a large island wide serosurvey, to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and the association with the vaccination and nutritional status to understand the likely impact of newer variants in Sri Lanka. Methods: Using the WHO UNITY protocol, we recruited 5207 children, aged 10 to 20 years, representative of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka, and assessed seropositive rates, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to BA.2.75 and XBB.1.5, in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine the association between nutrition status and antibody levels. Results: 3111/3119 (99.7%) vaccinated and 2008/2088 (96.2%) of unvaccinated children, were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 2984/3111 (95.9%) of vaccinated children had ACE2 blocking antibodies above the cut-off threshold, compared to 1346/2008 (67.0%) of unvaccinated children. 27.2 % unvaccinated children had positive antibody responses to BA.2.75 and 30.7% to XBB.1.5, while 64.3% of vaccinated had a positive response to BA.2.75 and 43.1% to XBB.1.5. Vaccinated children had significantly higher titres of total antibodies, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 than unvaccinated children. However, the vaccinated had significantly higher responses to BA.2.75 (p\u003c0.0001), than XBB.1.5. Unvaccinated children, with \u003c3rd BMI centile had significantly lower ACE2 blocking antibodies than other groups. Discussion: The high seropositivity rates and antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 variants in unvaccinated children, suggests that they are likely to have been infected more than once with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of lower antibody levels in undernourished children should be further investigated.\nDiagnostic testing preferences can help inform future public health response efforts: global insights from an international survey\nAuthors: Salzano, L.; Narayanan, N.; Tobik, E. R.; Akbarzada, S.; Wu, Y.; Megiel, S.; Choate, B.; Wyllie, A. L.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299858\nIntroductionPublic perception regarding clinical diagnostic sample types as well as personal experiences can influence willingness to test. As such, public preferences for specific sample type(s) should be used to inform diagnostic and surveillance testing programs to improve public health response efforts. To understand where preferences lie, we conducted an international survey regarding sample types used for SARS-CoV-2 tests. MethodsA Qualtrics survey regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences was distributed via social media and email. The survey collected preferences regarding test sample types and key demographic data. Python was used to analyze survey responses. ResultsFrom March 30th to June 15th, 2022, 2,094 responses were collected from 125 countries. Participants were 55% female and predominantly aged 25-34 years (27%). Education and employment were skewed: 51% had graduate degrees, 26% had bachelors degrees, 27% were scientists/researchers, and 29% were healthcare workers. By rank sum analysis, the most preferred sample type globally was the oral swab, followed by saliva, with parents/guardians preferring saliva-based testing for children. Respondents indicated a higher degree of trust in PCR testing (84%) vs. rapid antigen testing (36%). Preferences for self- or healthcare worker-collected sampling varied across regions. ConclusionsThis international survey identified a preference for oral sample types when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, respondents indicated that if they could be assured that all sample types performed equally, then saliva was preferred. Overall, survey responses reflected the region-specific testing experiences during the COVID-19.

J.; San\nScore: 50.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299623\nHuman genetic studies of critical COVID-19 pneumonia have revealed the essential role of type I interferon-dependent innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, an association between the HLA-B*15:01 allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals was recently reported, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing T cell-dependent adaptive immunity. We report a lack of association of classical HLA alleles, including HLA-B*15:01, with pre-omicron asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated participants in a prospective population-based study in the US (191 asymptomatic vs. 945 symptomatic COVID-19 cases). Moreover, we found no such association in the international COVID Human Genetic Effort cohort (206 asymptomatic vs. 574 mild or moderate COVID-19 cases and 1,625 severe or critical COVID-19 cases). Finally, in the Human Challenge Characterisation study, the three HLA-B*15:01 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed symptoms. As with other acute primary infections, no classical HLA alleles favoring an asymptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. These findings suggest that memory T-cell immunity to seasonal coronaviruses does not strongly influence the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Adverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P&lt;.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P&lt;.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P&lt;.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P&lt;.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P&lt;.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P&lt;.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for &gt;1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines.

MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [&amp;ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization.

ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses.

ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs.

ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 remains a global public health challenge due to ongoing emergence of new immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, heterogeneous immunity, poor education campaigns, and suboptimal surveillance. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the adaptive immune responses in US active-duty service members who completed a COVID-19 primary vaccine series to 3 previously dominant variants (Ancestral, Delta, BA.5) and compared them to 3 variants currently circulating (XBB.1.5, EG.5, and BA.2.86). Analyses were performed based upon time (within or beyond 12 months) and type (vaccine or infection) of most recent exposure. Significant reduction was observed in binding antibodies, neutralization antibodies, memory B cells, and CD8&#43; T cells against current circulating variants compared to previous dominant variants. The reduction in antibody response was more pronounced in those whose most recent exposure, regardless if vaccination or infection, was greater than 12 months from study enrollment. In contrast, the CD4&#43; T cell response was largely consistent across all tested variants. Our study did not show that the type exposure in the last 12 months was a significant factor in determining the magnitude of immune responses. However, the antibody responses to circulating variants were decreased among participants who received the bivalent booster compared to those with an infection in the past 12 months, potentially due to immunological imprinting of the Ancestral strain. Administration of the new XBB.1.5-based booster is likely to enhance cross-reactive humoral immune responses against current SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels &gt;90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSScopulariopsis/Microascus is a rare but devastating pathogen due to its intrinsic resistance to nearly all available antifungal agents. Microascus gracilis, an ascomycetous mould in the order Microascales, family Microascaceae, has recently emerged as a significant invasive pathogen causing opportunistic infections.

Objectives and MethodsWe present a case of pleural infection caused by M. gracilis with pulmonary aspergillosis in an immunocompromised man after COVID-19 pneumonia. To further understand the characteristics of the pathogen isolated from the patient, we identified the strain through mycological characteristics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based sequencing, and performed in vitro drug susceptibility testing against common antifungal agents. Moreover, we assessed lymphocyte subsets and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression in peripheral blood and pleural effusion to monitor the efficacy of therapy with thymosin--1 and intravenous immunoglobulin.

ResultsFilamentous fungi isolated from pleural fluid were identified as M. gracilis based on classical morphology, mass spectrometry and molecular biology methods. The susceptibility results in vitro revealed that multiple antifungal agents were inactive against the strain. Adjuvant immunomodulatory treatment successfully increased the levels of CD3&#43; T and CD4&#43; T cells while decreasing the levels of CD3&#43;PD-1&#43; and CD4&#43;PD-1&#43; T cells in both peripheral blood and pleural effusion.

ConclusionsThe immunocompromised host with opportunistic M. gracilis infection, rapid and accurate recognition through direct microscopic testing with calcofluor white and MOLDI-TOF MS, is the key to achieving a definite diagnosis, and a combination of antifungal therapy with immunomodulatory therapy is vital for improving survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: We investigated the seropositivity rates of Sri Lankan children in a large island wide serosurvey, to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and the association with the vaccination and nutritional status to understand the likely impact of newer variants in Sri Lanka. Methods: Using the WHO UNITY protocol, we recruited 5207 children, aged 10 to 20 years, representative of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka, and assessed seropositive rates, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to BA.2.75 and XBB.1.5, in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine the association between nutrition status and antibody levels. Results: 3111/3119 (99.7%) vaccinated and 2008/2088 (96.2%) of unvaccinated children, were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 2984/3111 (95.9%) of vaccinated children had ACE2 blocking antibodies above the cut-off threshold, compared to 1346/2008 (67.0%) of unvaccinated children. 27.2 % unvaccinated children had positive antibody responses to BA.2.75 and 30.7% to XBB.1.5, while 64.3% of vaccinated had a positive response to BA.2.75 and 43.1% to XBB.1.5. Vaccinated children had significantly higher titres of total antibodies, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 than unvaccinated children. However, the vaccinated had significantly higher responses to BA.2.75 (p&lt;0.0001), than XBB.1.5. Unvaccinated children, with &lt;3rd BMI centile had significantly lower ACE2 blocking antibodies than other groups. Discussion: The high seropositivity rates and antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 variants in unvaccinated children, suggests that they are likely to have been infected more than once with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of lower antibody levels in undernourished children should be further investigated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPublic perception regarding clinical diagnostic sample types as well as personal experiences can influence willingness to test. As such, public preferences for specific sample type(s) should be used to inform diagnostic and surveillance testing programs to improve public health response efforts. To understand where preferences lie, we conducted an international survey regarding sample types used for SARS-CoV-2 tests.

MethodsA Qualtrics survey regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences was distributed via social media and email. The survey collected preferences regarding test sample types and key demographic data. Python was used to analyze survey responses.

ResultsFrom March 30th to June 15th, 2022, 2,094 responses were collected from 125 countries. Participants were 55% female and predominantly aged 25-34 years (27%). Education and employment were skewed: 51% had graduate degrees, 26% had bachelors degrees, 27% were scientists/researchers, and 29% were healthcare workers. By rank sum analysis, the most preferred sample type globally was the oral swab, followed by saliva, with parents/guardians preferring saliva-based testing for children. Respondents indicated a higher degree of trust in PCR testing (84%) vs. rapid antigen testing (36%). Preferences for self- or healthcare worker-collected sampling varied across regions.

ConclusionsThis international survey identified a preference for oral sample types when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, respondents indicated that if they could be assured that all sample types performed equally, then saliva was preferred. Overall, survey responses reflected the region-specific testing experiences during the COVID-19. Public preferences should be considered when designing future response efforts to increase utilization, with oral sample types providing a practical option for large-scale, accessible diagnostic testing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human genetic studies of critical COVID-19 pneumonia have revealed the essential role of type I interferon-dependent innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, an association between the HLA-B*15:01 allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals was recently reported, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing T cell-dependent adaptive immunity. We report a lack of association of classical HLA alleles, including HLA-B*15:01, with pre-omicron asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated participants in a prospective population-based study in the US (191 asymptomatic vs. 945 symptomatic COVID-19 cases). Moreover, we found no such association in the international COVID Human Genetic Effort cohort (206 asymptomatic vs. 574 mild or moderate COVID-19 cases and 1,625 severe or critical COVID-19 cases). Finally, in the Human Challenge Characterisation study, the three HLA-B*15:01 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed symptoms. As with other acute primary infections, no classical HLA alleles favoring an asymptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. These findings suggest that memory T-cell immunity to seasonal coronaviruses does not strongly influence the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals.</p>
