I.\nScore: 74.4, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293072\nBackgroundThe continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires timely analytical and clinical evaluation of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) especially those that are recommended for at home use. MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) of 34 Ag-RDTs was evaluated using the most encountered SARS-CoV-2 VOC viral isolates (Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.5) and the wild type (WT). Clinical sensitivity was further evaluated for five Ag-RDT utilising retrospective samples (Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1) and one Ag-RDT utilising prospective clinical samples (Delta and Omicron BA.1). FindingsFor the WT, Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron (BA.1) variants 22, 32, 29, 31 and 32 of the 34 Ag-RDTs evaluated met the World Health Organisations (WHO) target product profile (TPP), respectively. Of the 31 Ag-RDTs included for Omicron BA.5 evaluation 29 met the WHO TPP. Additionally, the LODs for samples spiked with Omicron BA.5 were significantly lower than all other VOCs included (p\u003c0.001). In the retrospective clinical evaluation when comparing RNA copies/mL, the Ag-RDTs detected Alpha and Omicron (BA.1) more sensitively than the Delta VOC. Samples with high RT-qPCR Cts (Ct\u003e25) resulted in reduced test sensitivities across all variants. We used linear regression to model the 50% and 95% LOD of clinical samples and observed statistically similar results for all tests. In the prospective clinical samples, the sensitivity was statistically similar for the Delta VOC 71.9% (CI 95% 53.3-86.6%) and Omicron VOC 84.4% (CI95% 75.3-91.2%). InterpretationTest performance differs between SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and high sensitivity was achieved when testing the Omicron BA.5 VOC compared to the WHO Ag-RDT requirements. Continuous evaluations must be performed to monitor test performance.

R.; Thwaites, R. S.; Reynaldi, A.; Sidhu, J. K.; McKendry, R.; Ascough, S.; Papargyris, L.; Collins, A. M.; Xu, J.; Lemm, N.-M.; Siggins, M. K.; Chain, B. M.; Killingley, B.; Kalinova, M.; Mann, A.; Catchpole, A.; Davenport, M. P.; Openshaw, P. J. M.; Chiu, C.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292994\nHuman infection challenge permits characterisation of the associated immune response in unparalleled depth, enabling evaluation of early pre-symptomatic immune changes and the dynamic immune factors important for viral clearance. Here, 34 healthy young adult volunteers, seronegative to SARS-CoV-2, were inoculated with a D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2 strain. Nasal and systemic soluble mediator and antibody responses, and peripheral blood T cell and B cell responses were measured by MesoScale Discovery and flow cytometry just before and up to 1 year after intra-nasal inoculation. In the 18 (53%) participants who became infected, both nasal and systemic mediator responses were dominated by interferons (IFN) but with divergent kinetics. T cell activation and proliferation in blood peaked at day 10 in CD4+ T cells and day 14 in CD8+ T cells, returning to baseline by day 28. Following infection, antigen-specific T cells were largely CD38+Ki67+ and displayed central and effector memory phenotypes. T cells contracted after viral clearance with expanded antigen-specific memory T cell populations persisting past day 28. Both mucosal and systemic antibodies became detectable around day 10 but nasal antibodies plateaued after day 14 while circulating antibodies continued to rise. Using piecewise linear regression modelling, viral load related closely to the induction of type I IFN responses, moreover, CD8+ T cell responses and early IgA responses were strongly associated with viral clearance. Detailed analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection following human challenge thus revealed the relationship between immune kinetics and viral load as factors associated with resolution of infection.\nEarly Biological Markers of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection\nAuthors: Lu, S.; Peluso, M. J.; Glidden, D. V.; Davidson, M.; Lugtu, K.; Pineda-Ramirez, J.; Tassetto, M.; Garcia-Knight, M.; Zhang, A.; Goldberg, S. A.; Chen, J.; Forbes, M.; Park, S.; Martinez, A.; So, M.; Donovan, A.; Viswanathan, B.; Hoh, R.; Donohue, K.; McIlwain, D.; Gaudilliere, B.; Anglin, K.; Yee, B.; Chenna, A. A.; Winslow, J.; Petropoulos, C.; Briggs-Hagen, M.; Andino, R.; Midgley, C.; Martin, J. N.; Saydeh, S.; Kelly, J. D.\nScore: 315.7, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292649\nTo understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC. Onset Sentence SummaryEarly viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC.\nIncubation-period estimates of Omicron (BA.1) variant from Taiwan, December 2021-January 2022, and its comparison to other SARS-CoV-2 variants: a statistical modeling, systematic search and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Akhmetzhanov, A. R.; Cheng, H.-Y.; Dushoff, J.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292983\nBackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen several variants of concern, including the Omicron (BA.1) variant which emerged in October 2021. Accurately estimating the incubation period of these variants is crucial for predicting disease spread and formulating effective public health strategies. However, existing estimates often conflict because of biases arising from the dynamic nature of epidemic growth and selective inclusion of cases. This study aims to accurately estimate of the Omicron (BA.1) variant incubation period based on data from Taiwan, where disease incidence remained low and contact tracing was comprehensive during the first months of the Omicron outbreak. MethodsWe reviewed 100 contact-tracing records for cases of the Omicron BA.1 variant reported between December 2021 and January 2022, and found enough information to analyze 70 of these. The incubation period distribution was estimated by fitting data on exposure and symptom onset within a Bayesian mixture model using gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions as candidates. Additionally, a systematic literature search was conducted to accumulate data for estimates of the incubation period for Omicron (BA.1/2, BA.4/5) subvariants, which was then used for meta-analysis and comparison. ResultsThe mean incubation period was estimated at 3.5 days (95% credible interval: 3.1-4.0 days), with no clear differences when stratified by vaccination status or age. This estimate aligns closely with the pooled mean of 3.4 days (3.0-3.8 days) obtained from a meta-analysis of other published studies on Omicron subvariants. ConclusionsThe relatively shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant, as compared to previous SARS-CoV2 variants, implies its potential for rapid spread but also opens the possibility for individuals to voluntarily adopt shorter, more resource-efficient quarantine periods. Continual updates to incubation period estimates, utilizing data from comprehensive contact tracing, are crucial for effectively guiding these voluntary actions and adjusting high socio-economic cost interventions.\nA low-cost molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 detection suitable for variant discrimination and community testing using saliva\nAuthors: Silva, S. M.; Amaral, C.; Luis, C.; Grilo, D.; Duarte, A.; Morais, I.; Afonso, G.; Faria, N.; Antunes, W.; Gomes, I.; Sa-Leao, R.; Miragaia, M.; Serrano, M.; Pimentel, C.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292863\nThe gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing relies on RNA extraction from naso/oropharyngeal swab followed by amplification through RT-PCR with fluorogenic probes. While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes. In this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than {euro} 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2. To further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.\nRisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in individuals with natural, vaccine-induced and hybrid immunity: a retrospective population-based cohort study from Estonia\nAuthors: Uuskula, A.; Pisarev, H.; Tisler, A.; Meister, T.; Suija, K.; Huik, K.; Abroi, A.; Kalda, R.; Kolde, R.; Fischer, K.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.23292858\nA large proportion of the worlds population has some form of immunity against SARS-CoV- 2, through either infection ( natural), vaccination or both ( hybrid). This retrospective cohort study used data on SARS-CoV-2, vaccination, and hospitalization from national health system from February 2020 to June 2022 and Cox regression modelling to compare those with natural immunity to those with no (Cohort1, n=92917), hybrid (Cohort2, n=46813), and vaccine (Cohort3, n=252414) immunity. In Cohort 1, those with natural immunity were at lower risk for infection during the Delta (aHR 0.17, 95%CI 0.15-0.18) and higher risk (aHR 1.24, 95%CI 1.18-1.32) during the Omicron period than those with no immunity. Natural immunity conferred substantial protection against COVID-19-hospitalization. Cohort 2 - in comparison to natural immunity hybrid immunity offered strong protection during the Delta (aHR 0.61, 95%CI 0.46-0.80) but not the Omicron (aHR 1.05, 95%CI 0.93-1.1) period. COVID-19-hospitalization was extremely rare among individuals with hybrid immunity. In Cohort 3, individuals with vaccine-induced immunity were at higher risk than those with natural immunity for infection (Delta aHR 4.90, 95%CI 4.48-5.36; Omicron 1.13, 95%CI 1.06-1.21) and hospitalization (Delta aHR 7.19, 95%CI 4.02-12.84). These results show that risk of infection and severe COVID-19 are driven by personal immunity history and the variant of SARS-CoV-2 causing infection.\nMeta-analysis on Plasmodium falciparum sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance-conferring mutations in India identifies hot spots for genetic surveillance\nAuthors: Sinha, A.; Kar, S.; Chauhan, C.; Yadav, C. P.; Kori, L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293131\nBackgroundIndia is on track to eliminate malaria by 2030 but emerging resistance to the first-line antimalarials is a recognized threat. As Artesunate+Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) is the drug-of-choice for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in most of India, it becomes evident to systematically monitor the validated mutations in Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes across India. No systematic and robust countrywide surveillance has been reported for these parameters in India. MethodsWe included studies that reported data on SP-resistance markers in P. falciparum across India from 2008. Five major databases were exhaustively searched. Individual and pooled prevalence estimates of mutations were obtained through random- and fixed-effect models. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021236012). ResultsA total of 37 publications with data from 80 districts, 21 states and 3 UTs were included. The two PfDHFR mutations, C59R and S108N were the most prevalent mutations and appear to be stabilized/fixed. Although rarest overall, the prevalence of I164L was observed to be as high as 32%. The PfDHFR double mutants were the most prevalent overall. The prevalence of triple and quadruple mutations was 6% and 5%, respectively which is an area of immediate concern. For PfDHPS, the most prevalent mutation was A437G. For PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple and sextuple mutations, it was observed that despite a low overall prevalence of these mutations, some areas are critical for surveillance. ConclusionThe analysis brings forward the SP-resistance hot spots and emphasizes critical gaps, and challenges, and suggests focal and local malaria genetic surveillance (including drug resistance markers) till malaria is eliminated. Key pointsThis manuscript concludes that currently used first-line drugs for P. falciparum malaria, particularly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have a high likelihood of failing in near future. Although currently effective, the evidence is backed by molecular meta-analyses data on drug resistance markers in India. The policy makers and program managers may use this robust data to decide whether it is time to change these currently used anti-malarials in India before it is too late. It also identifies certain hot spots for continuous genetic monitoring of the molecular markers for timely actions.\nHealth-seeking behaviour and beliefs around sore throat in The Gambia: a qualitative study\nAuthors: Suau Sans, M.; Manneh, M.; Ceesay, I.; Bittaye, A.; de Crombrugghe, G.; Keeley, A. J.; de Silva, T. I.; Palmer, J.; Armitage, E. P.; Marks, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292793\nGroup A Streptococcus (StrepA) bacteria causes a broad spectrum of diseases. The most common manifestations of StrepA infection are sore throat and pus-producing skin infections such as impetigo. Complications of StrepA infection lead to inflammation in the bones, muscles, joints, and internal organs causing acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In The Gambia, the RHD burden is thought to be very high. However, epidemiological data is minimal, and StrepA control programmes do not exist. This study aims to explore common beliefs and practices related to sore throats among primary caregivers of children, and healthcare providers in a community with a high StrepA disease burden. This will inform the design of preventative strategies for StrepA-related sequelae. Four informal conversations with providers and fifteen semi-structured interviews with caregivers were conducted in the peri-urban area of Sukuta, The Gambia. Sampling was purposive and gradual, beginning from households identified to have recently experienced sore throat through a parallel cohort study. Themes explored in qualitative analysis included: sore throat causal attributions and diagnoses, care practises, health-seeking behaviour, and perceived barriers to using the biomedical sector. Sore throats were typically perceived to affect one child in a family, disproportionately or exclusively. Sore throats are rarely perceived as life-threatening, and awareness of links between sore throat and ARF or RHD was not reported among caregivers or providers in this study population. Most cases of sore throat are initially managed at home using traditional medicine which delays resort to antibiotics, though in two instances of severe pain with the presence of exudate, fear that the childs life was at risk prompted care-seeking through the formal health system. Our findings can inform the development of tailored strategies to increase community knowledge of the potential long-term consequences of sore throats and appropriate care-seeking, alongside improvements in the health system, to prevent StrepA sequelae effectively.\nNationally representative prevalence and determinants of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) amongst Mexican adults in 2022\nAuthors: Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Fermin-Martinez, C. A.; Fernandez-Chirino, L.; Ramirez-Garcia, D.; Vargas-Vazquez, A.; Basile-Alvarez, M. R.; Sanchez-Castro, P.; Nunez-Luna, A.; Antonio-Villa, N. E.\nScore: 51.8, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292475\nOBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data. METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [\u0026ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [\u0026ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights. RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [\u0026ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [\u0026ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance. CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.\nChronic Shedding of a SARS-CoV-2 Alpha Variant Lineage Q.3/Q.4 in Wastewater\nAuthors: Conway, M. J.; Yang, H.; Revord, L. A.; Ward, A. S.; Abel, J. D.; Williams, M. R.; Uzarski, R. L.; Alm, E. W.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293191\nCentral Michigan University (CMU) participated in a state-wide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring program since 2021. Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires timely analytical and clinical evaluation of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) especially those that are recommended for at home use.

MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) of 34 Ag-RDTs was evaluated using the most encountered SARS-CoV-2 VOC viral isolates (Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.5) and the wild type (WT). Clinical sensitivity was further evaluated for five Ag-RDT utilising retrospective samples (Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1) and one Ag-RDT utilising prospective clinical samples (Delta and Omicron BA.1).

FindingsFor the WT, Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron (BA.1) variants 22, 32, 29, 31 and 32 of the 34 Ag-RDTs evaluated met the World Health Organisations (WHO) target product profile (TPP), respectively. Of the 31 Ag-RDTs included for Omicron BA.5 evaluation 29 met the WHO TPP. Additionally, the LODs for samples spiked with Omicron BA.5 were significantly lower than all other VOCs included (p&lt;0.001). In the retrospective clinical evaluation when comparing RNA copies/mL, the Ag-RDTs detected Alpha and Omicron (BA.1) more sensitively than the Delta VOC. Samples with high RT-qPCR Cts (Ct&gt;25) resulted in reduced test sensitivities across all variants. We used linear regression to model the 50% and 95% LOD of clinical samples and observed statistically similar results for all tests. In the prospective clinical samples, the sensitivity was statistically similar for the Delta VOC 71.9% (CI 95% 53.3-86.6%) and Omicron VOC 84.4% (CI95% 75.3-91.2%).

InterpretationTest performance differs between SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and high sensitivity was achieved when testing the Omicron BA.5 VOC compared to the WHO Ag-RDT requirements. Continuous evaluations must be performed to monitor test performance.

        <p class="abstract">Human infection challenge permits characterisation of the associated immune response in unparalleled depth, enabling evaluation of early pre-symptomatic immune changes and the dynamic immune factors important for viral clearance. Here, 34 healthy young adult volunteers, seronegative to SARS-CoV-2, were inoculated with a D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2 strain. Nasal and systemic soluble mediator and antibody responses, and peripheral blood T cell and B cell responses were measured by MesoScale Discovery and flow cytometry just before and up to 1 year after intra-nasal inoculation. In the 18 (53%) participants who became infected, both nasal and systemic mediator responses were dominated by interferons (IFN) but with divergent kinetics. T cell activation and proliferation in blood peaked at day 10 in CD4&#43; T cells and day 14 in CD8&#43; T cells, returning to baseline by day 28. Following infection, antigen-specific T cells were largely CD38&#43;Ki67&#43; and displayed central and effector memory phenotypes. T cells contracted after viral clearance with expanded antigen-specific memory T cell populations persisting past day 28. Both mucosal and systemic antibodies became detectable around day 10 but nasal antibodies plateaued after day 14 while circulating antibodies continued to rise. Using piecewise linear regression modelling, viral load related closely to the induction of type I IFN responses, moreover, CD8&#43; T cell responses and early IgA responses were strongly associated with viral clearance. Detailed analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection following human challenge thus revealed the relationship between immune kinetics and viral load as factors associated with resolution of infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-, and IFN-{gamma}) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen several variants of concern, including the Omicron (BA.1) variant which emerged in October 2021. Accurately estimating the incubation period of these variants is crucial for predicting disease spread and formulating effective public health strategies. However, existing estimates often conflict because of biases arising from the dynamic nature of epidemic growth and selective inclusion of cases. This study aims to accurately estimate of the Omicron (BA.1) variant incubation period based on data from Taiwan, where disease incidence remained low and contact tracing was comprehensive during the first months of the Omicron outbreak.

MethodsWe reviewed 100 contact-tracing records for cases of the Omicron BA.1 variant reported between December 2021 and January 2022, and found enough information to analyze 70 of these. The incubation period distribution was estimated by fitting data on exposure and symptom onset within a Bayesian mixture model using gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions as candidates. Additionally, a systematic literature search was conducted to accumulate data for estimates of the incubation period for Omicron (BA.1/2, BA.4/5) subvariants, which was then used for meta-analysis and comparison.

ResultsThe mean incubation period was estimated at 3.5 days (95% credible interval: 3.1-4.0 days), with no clear differences when stratified by vaccination status or age. This estimate aligns closely with the pooled mean of 3.4 days (3.0-3.8 days) obtained from a meta-analysis of other published studies on Omicron subvariants.

ConclusionsThe relatively shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant, as compared to previous SARS-CoV2 variants, implies its potential for rapid spread but also opens the possibility for individuals to voluntarily adopt shorter, more resource-efficient quarantine periods. Continual updates to incubation period estimates, utilizing data from comprehensive contact tracing, are crucial for effectively guiding these voluntary actions and adjusting high socio-economic cost interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing relies on RNA extraction from naso/oropharyngeal swab followed by amplification through RT-PCR with fluorogenic probes. While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes.

In this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than {euro} 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2.

To further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A large proportion of the worlds population has some form of immunity against SARS-CoV- 2, through either infection ( natural), vaccination or both ( hybrid). This retrospective cohort study used data on SARS-CoV-2, vaccination, and hospitalization from national health system from February 2020 to June 2022 and Cox regression modelling to compare those with natural immunity to those with no (Cohort1, n=92917), hybrid (Cohort2, n=46813), and vaccine (Cohort3, n=252414) immunity. In Cohort 1, those with natural immunity were at lower risk for infection during the Delta (aHR 0.17, 95%CI 0.15-0.18) and higher risk (aHR 1.24, 95%CI 1.18-1.32) during the Omicron period than those with no immunity. Natural immunity conferred substantial protection against COVID-19-hospitalization. Cohort 2 - in comparison to natural immunity hybrid immunity offered strong protection during the Delta (aHR 0.61, 95%CI 0.46-0.80) but not the Omicron (aHR 1.05, 95%CI 0.93-1.1) period. COVID-19-hospitalization was extremely rare among individuals with hybrid immunity. In Cohort 3, individuals with vaccine-induced immunity were at higher risk than those with natural immunity for infection (Delta aHR 4.90, 95%CI 4.48-5.36; Omicron 1.13, 95%CI 1.06-1.21) and hospitalization (Delta aHR 7.19, 95%CI 4.02-12.84). These results show that risk of infection and severe COVID-19 are driven by personal immunity history and the variant of SARS-CoV-2 causing infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia is on track to eliminate malaria by 2030 but emerging resistance to the first-line antimalarials is a recognized threat. As Artesunate&#43;Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS&#43;SP) is the drug-of-choice for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in most of India, it becomes evident to systematically monitor the validated mutations in Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes across India. No systematic and robust countrywide surveillance has been reported for these parameters in India.

MethodsWe included studies that reported data on SP-resistance markers in P. falciparum across India from 2008. Five major databases were exhaustively searched. Individual and pooled prevalence estimates of mutations were obtained through random- and fixed-effect models. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021236012).

ResultsA total of 37 publications with data from 80 districts, 21 states and 3 UTs were included. The two PfDHFR mutations, C59R and S108N were the most prevalent mutations and appear to be stabilized/fixed. Although rarest overall, the prevalence of I164L was observed to be as high as 32%. The PfDHFR double mutants were the most prevalent overall. The prevalence of triple and quadruple mutations was 6% and 5%, respectively which is an area of immediate concern. For PfDHPS, the most prevalent mutation was A437G. For PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple and sextuple mutations, it was observed that despite a low overall prevalence of these mutations, some areas are critical for surveillance.

ConclusionThe analysis brings forward the SP-resistance hot spots and emphasizes critical gaps, and challenges, and suggests focal and local malaria genetic surveillance (including drug resistance markers) till malaria is eliminated.

Key pointsThis manuscript concludes that currently used first-line drugs for P. falciparum malaria, particularly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have a high likelihood of failing in near future. Although currently effective, the evidence is backed by molecular meta-analyses data on drug resistance markers in India. The policy makers and program managers may use this robust data to decide whether it is time to change these currently used anti-malarials in India before it is too late. It also identifies certain hot spots for continuous genetic monitoring of the molecular markers for timely actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Group A Streptococcus (StrepA) bacteria causes a broad spectrum of diseases. The most common manifestations of StrepA infection are sore throat and pus-producing skin infections such as impetigo. Complications of StrepA infection lead to inflammation in the bones, muscles, joints, and internal organs causing acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In The Gambia, the RHD burden is thought to be very high. However, epidemiological data is minimal, and StrepA control programmes do not exist. This study aims to explore common beliefs and practices related to sore throats among primary caregivers of children, and healthcare providers in a community with a high StrepA disease burden. This will inform the design of preventative strategies for StrepA-related sequelae.

Four informal conversations with providers and fifteen semi-structured interviews with caregivers were conducted in the peri-urban area of Sukuta, The Gambia. Sampling was purposive and gradual, beginning from households identified to have recently experienced sore throat through a parallel cohort study. Themes explored in qualitative analysis included: sore throat causal attributions and diagnoses, care practises, health-seeking behaviour, and perceived barriers to using the biomedical sector.

Sore throats were typically perceived to affect one child in a family, disproportionately or exclusively. Sore throats are rarely perceived as life-threatening, and awareness of links between sore throat and ARF or RHD was not reported among caregivers or providers in this study population. Most cases of sore throat are initially managed at home using traditional medicine which delays resort to antibiotics, though in two instances of severe pain with the presence of exudate, fear that the childs life was at risk prompted care-seeking through the formal health system.

Our findings can inform the development of tailored strategies to increase community knowledge of the potential long-term consequences of sore throats and appropriate care-seeking, alongside improvements in the health system, to prevent StrepA sequelae effectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [&amp;ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [&amp;ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights.

RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [&amp;ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [&amp;ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance.

CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Central Michigan University (CMU) participated in a state-wide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring program since 2021. Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.</p>
