M.\nScore: 293.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298565\nAdverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P\u003c.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P\u003c.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P\u003c.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P\u003c.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P\u003c.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P\u003c.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.\nThe spectrum of non-fatal immune-related adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination: The population-based cohort study in Seoul, South Korea\nAuthors: Suh, J. H.; Kim, H. J.; Kim, M.-H.; Choi, M. G.; Chun, E. M.\nScore: 158.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298566\nObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination. ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs. ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.\nPost-pandemic memory T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is durable, broadly targeted and cross-reactive to hypermutated BA.2.86\nAuthors: Nesamari, R.; Omondi, M. A.; Hoft, M. A.; Ngomti, A.; Baguma, R.; Nkayi, A. A.; Besethi, A. S.; Magugu, S. F.; Mosala, P.; Walters, A.; Clark, G. M.; Mennen, M.; Skelem, S.; Adriaanse, M.; Grifoni, A.; Sette, A.; Keeton, R. S.; Ntusi, N. A.; Riou, C.; Burgers, W. A.\nScore: 64.8, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297714\nThe COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson \u0026 Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19. In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypic resistance in people treated with entecavir or tenofovir\nAuthors: Lumley, S. F.; Delphin, M.; Mokaya, J. F.; Tan, C. C.; Martyn, E.; Anderson, M.; Li, K. C.; Waddilove, E.; Sukali, G.; Downs, L. O.; Said, K.; Okanda, D.; Campbell, C.; Harriss, E.; Shimakawa, Y.; Matthews, P. C.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298154\nBackgroundAs nucleos/tide analogue (NA) therapy for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes more widely indicated and available, understanding drug resistance is essential. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of genotypic resistance to tenofovir and entecavir. MethodsWe searched nine databases up to 29-Aug-23. We included studies of HBV infection featuring \u003e10 individuals, written in English, reporting tenofovir or entecavir treatment [\u0026ge;]48 weeks, with assessment of HBV genotypic resistance. Data were analysed according to prior exposure history to NA, and treatment with tenofovir or entecavir. Analyses were performed in R. Results62 studies involving a total of 12,358 participants were included. For tenofovir, pooled resistance risk was 0.0% at all time points, whether previously NA naive (11 studies; 3778 individuals) or experienced (19 studies; 2059 individuals). For entecavir, in treatment-naive individuals (22 studies; 4326 individuals), risk of resistance increased over time to 0.9% at [\u0026ge;]5 years (95%CI 0.1-2.3%). Entecavir resistance was increased in NA-experienced individuals (18 studies;1112 individuals), to 20.1% (95%CI 1.6-50.1%) at [\u0026ge;]5 years. There was a lack of consistent definitions, poor global representation and insufficient metadata to support subgroup analysis. DiscussionBased on existing data, tenofovir has an excellent resistance profile. More resistance is seen with entecavir, particularly in treatment-experienced groups. Due to data gaps, we may have under-estimated the true risk of resistance. Robust prospective data collection is crucial as treatment is rolled out more widely.\nBaseline malaria infection status and RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine efficacy\nAuthors: Juraska, M.; Early, A. M.; Li, L.; Schaffner, S. F.; Lievens, M.; Khorgade, A. R.; Simpkins, B.; Hejazi, N.; Benkeser, D. A.; Wang, Q.; Mercer, L. D.; Adjei, S.; Agbenyega, T.; Anderson, S.; Ansong, D.; Bii, D. K.; Buabeng, P. B. Y.; English, S.; Fitzgerald, N.; Grimsby, J.; Kariuki, S. K.; Otieno, K.; Roman, F. P.; Samuels, A. M.; Westercamp, N.; Ockenhouse, C. F.; Ofori-Anyinam, O.; Lee, C. K.; MacInnis, B. L.; Wirth, D. F.; Gilbert, P.; Neafsey, D. E.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298907\nBackgroundThe only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE). Methods1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection. ResultsWe observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059). ConclusionsAll tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation.

R.; Davenport, M. P.; Khoury, D. S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298850\nThe Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine developed by Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was widely deployed to prevent Mpox during the 2022 global outbreak. This vaccine was initially approved for Mpox based on its reported immunogenicity and effectiveness in animal models, rather than evidence of clinical efficacy. However no validated correlate of protection after vaccination has been identified. Here we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis of the available data to test whether vaccinia-binding ELISA endpoint titer is predictive of vaccine effectiveness against Mpox. We observe a significant correlation between vaccine effectiveness and vaccinia-binding antibody titers, consistent with the existing assumption that antibody levels may be a correlate of protection. Combining this data with analysis of antibody kinetics after vaccination, we predict the durability of protection after vaccination and the impact of dose spacing. Although further work is required to validate this correlate, this study provides the first evidence-based approach for using antibody measurements to predict the effectiveness of Mpox vaccination. Mpox virus (formerly Monkeypox) is a zoonotic virus endemic in West Africa, with significant outbreaks in 1980-1986 and in 1997-19981, resulting in over 20,000 total recorded cases. Prior to 2017, these outbreaks were typically small and initiated by zoonotic transmission followed by self-terminating human-to-human chains of transmission2. However, since 2017, there has been a resurgence of Mpox in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other parts of Africa, attributed to waning immunity from smallpox vaccines and accumulation of cohorts that have never been vaccinated against smallpox3. In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox resulted in 91000+ confirmed cases in 115 countries and established chains of human-human transmission leading to a renewed focus on vaccination as a preventative measure for Mpox4. Although there is no Mpox-specific vaccine, first generation smallpox vaccination was observed to protect individuals against Mpox infection during the 1980-1986 Mpox outbreak in the DRC (then Zaire)5-8, with an estimated vaccine effectiveness of approximately 85%5, and this has also been observed in similar subsequent studies9-11. However, the livereplicating vaccinia vaccines (first and second-generation) have significant risks of serious vaccine adverse events12, which led to the development of the third-generation Modified Vaccinia Ankara live-attenuated (replication deficient) vaccine (MVA-BN). Prior to the 2022 Mpox outbreak, MVA-BN was approved by the FDA for use as a Smallpox and Mpox vaccine (two doses of 1 x 108 TCID via subcutaneous injection). Given the challenge of directly assessing the efficacy of this vaccine in an RCT, regulatory approval was based on demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity profile and improved safety compared to the second-generation ACAM2000 vaccine13. In particular, comparing vaccinia neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination of MVA-BN and ACAM2000, it was deemed \"reasonable to expect that this regimen of the vaccine is effective in smallpox vaccinia-naive as well as in smallpox vaccine experienced individuals\"13. This was supported by studies in nonhuman primates implicating antibodies directly in mediating protection against lethal Mpox challenge14. Analysis of case data during the 2022 global outbreak indicates that the MVA-BN vaccine is effective for prevention of Mpox15-20, and affirms the decisions to use these vaccines during the outbreaks. However, important questions remain to be addressed. Firstly, how does MVA-BN effectiveness compare with the protection conferred by the live replicating smallpox vaccines, and how many doses are required? Further, is the protection from MVA-BN vaccination expected to be durable, and will further booster doses be required to confer durable protection against Mpox and protect individuals in potential future outbreaks? Here we address these questions by aggregating the available data on the effectiveness of different vaccinia-based vaccination regimes in protection against Mpox. We compare protection from first generation smallpox vaccines with the protection conferred by one or two doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. Further, given the assumed role of antibodies, we aggregate data on vaccinia-specific ELISA endpoint titers (here after referred to as vaccinia-binding titers) after MVA-BN vaccination (which have been shown to correlate with neutralizing antibody titers to Mpox after vaccinia vaccination21), and study the relationship between antibody levels and effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the kinetics of antibody decay over time to predict the duration of protection afforded by 1, 2 or 3 doses of vaccination. This work offers a data-driven approach to support public health decision making on Mpox vaccination and boosting campaigns.\nAssessment of the Usability of SARS-CoV-2 Self Tests in a Peer-Assisted Model among Factory Workers in Bengaluru, India\nAuthors: Pydi, M. R.; Stankard, P.; Parikh, N.; Ranawat, P.; Kaur, R.; AG, S.; Chaudhuri, A.; Shilton, S.; Srinivasan, A.; Chowdhury, J.; Ivanova Reipold, E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298784\nIn order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.\nRe-emergence of Sylvatic Dengue 2 during an outbreak in Southeastern Senegal, Kedougou 2020\nAuthors: Dieng, I.; Diarra, M.; Sadio, B.

We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed. Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge\nPrevalence of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Diabetic Patients Visiting the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana\nAuthors: Boaitey-Biko, A. S.; Bukari, I.; Ogbe, I.; Debrah, M. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299071\nMisuse of antibiotics contributes to the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance. However, it is equally important to consider inevitable situations that may contribute to a rise in antibiotic resistance and implement best practices to ensure the minimality of their resulting adverse effects. A case in point is the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a strain of bacterium that has developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other lactams among long-term diabetic patients as observed in this study. Diabetes is associated with immunosuppression and foot ulcers, which require the constant use of antibiotics as prophylactics, as such, persons with this condition would hold bacterial populations subject to immense selective pressure and are therefore at increased risk for MRSA colonization. Furthermore, these individuals may serve as reservoirs and disseminate these highly drug-resistant strains on return to the general populace. This warranted an investigation into the prevalence of MRSA among diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital. A total of 50 samples were taken from the sampled Military Hospital by swabbing the participants' skin, nose, and wounds aseptically, and 20 samples were acquired from non-diabetics to serve as controls. To culture the samples, blood, and mannitol salt agar were used. Bacteria were isolated and identified using Gram staining and other biochemical testing. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used with Muller-Hinton agar to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. According to the study's findings, antibiotic resistance was much higher among diabetic patients than among non-diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Adverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P&lt;.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P&lt;.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P&lt;.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P&lt;.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P&lt;.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P&lt;.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs.

ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs nucleos/tide analogue (NA) therapy for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes more widely indicated and available, understanding drug resistance is essential. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of genotypic resistance to tenofovir and entecavir.

MethodsWe searched nine databases up to 29-Aug-23. We included studies of HBV infection featuring &gt;10 individuals, written in English, reporting tenofovir or entecavir treatment [&amp;ge;]48 weeks, with assessment of HBV genotypic resistance. Data were analysed according to prior exposure history to NA, and treatment with tenofovir or entecavir. Analyses were performed in R.

Results62 studies involving a total of 12,358 participants were included. For tenofovir, pooled resistance risk was 0.0% at all time points, whether previously NA naive (11 studies; 3778 individuals) or experienced (19 studies; 2059 individuals). For entecavir, in treatment-naive individuals (22 studies; 4326 individuals), risk of resistance increased over time to 0.9% at [&amp;ge;]5 years (95%CI 0.1-2.3%). Entecavir resistance was increased in NA-experienced individuals (18 studies;1112 individuals), to 20.1% (95%CI 1.6-50.1%) at [&amp;ge;]5 years. There was a lack of consistent definitions, poor global representation and insufficient metadata to support subgroup analysis.

DiscussionBased on existing data, tenofovir has an excellent resistance profile. More resistance is seen with entecavir, particularly in treatment-experienced groups. Due to data gaps, we may have under-estimated the true risk of resistance. Robust prospective data collection is crucial as treatment is rolled out more widely.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE).

Methods1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection.

ResultsWe observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059).

ConclusionsAll tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03276962)</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine developed by Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was widely deployed to prevent Mpox during the 2022 global outbreak. This vaccine was initially approved for Mpox based on its reported immunogenicity and effectiveness in animal models, rather than evidence of clinical efficacy. However no validated correlate of protection after vaccination has been identified. Here we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis of the available data to test whether vaccinia-binding ELISA endpoint titer is predictive of vaccine effectiveness against Mpox. We observe a significant correlation between vaccine effectiveness and vaccinia-binding antibody titers, consistent with the existing assumption that antibody levels may be a correlate of protection. Combining this data with analysis of antibody kinetics after vaccination, we predict the durability of protection after vaccination and the impact of dose spacing. Although further work is required to validate this correlate, this study provides the first evidence-based approach for using antibody measurements to predict the effectiveness of Mpox vaccination.

Mpox virus (formerly Monkeypox) is a zoonotic virus endemic in West Africa, with significant outbreaks in 1980-1986 and in 1997-19981, resulting in over 20,000 total recorded cases. Prior to 2017, these outbreaks were typically small and initiated by zoonotic transmission followed by self-terminating human-to-human chains of transmission2. However, since 2017, there has been a resurgence of Mpox in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other parts of Africa, attributed to waning immunity from smallpox vaccines and accumulation of cohorts that have never been vaccinated against smallpox3. In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox resulted in 91000&#43; confirmed cases in 115 countries and established chains of human-human transmission leading to a renewed focus on vaccination as a preventative measure for Mpox4.

Although there is no Mpox-specific vaccine, first generation smallpox vaccination was observed to protect individuals against Mpox infection during the 1980-1986 Mpox outbreak in the DRC (then Zaire)5-8, with an estimated vaccine effectiveness of approximately 85%5, and this has also been observed in similar subsequent studies9-11. However, the livereplicating vaccinia vaccines (first and second-generation) have significant risks of serious vaccine adverse events12, which led to the development of the third-generation Modified Vaccinia Ankara live-attenuated (replication deficient) vaccine (MVA-BN). Prior to the 2022 Mpox outbreak, MVA-BN was approved by the FDA for use as a Smallpox and Mpox vaccine (two doses of 1 x 108 TCID via subcutaneous injection). Given the challenge of directly assessing the efficacy of this vaccine in an RCT, regulatory approval was based on demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity profile and improved safety compared to the second-generation ACAM2000 vaccine13. In particular, comparing vaccinia neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination of MVA-BN and ACAM2000, it was deemed &#34;reasonable to expect that this regimen of the vaccine is effective in smallpox vaccinia-naive as well as in smallpox vaccine experienced individuals&#34;13. This was supported by studies in nonhuman primates implicating antibodies directly in mediating protection against lethal Mpox challenge14.

Analysis of case data during the 2022 global outbreak indicates that the MVA-BN vaccine is effective for prevention of Mpox15-20, and affirms the decisions to use these vaccines during the outbreaks. However, important questions remain to be addressed. Firstly, how does MVA-BN effectiveness compare with the protection conferred by the live replicating smallpox vaccines, and how many doses are required? Further, is the protection from MVA-BN vaccination expected to be durable, and will further booster doses be required to confer durable protection against Mpox and protect individuals in potential future outbreaks?

Here we address these questions by aggregating the available data on the effectiveness of different vaccinia-based vaccination regimes in protection against Mpox. We compare protection from first generation smallpox vaccines with the protection conferred by one or two doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. Further, given the assumed role of antibodies, we aggregate data on vaccinia-specific ELISA endpoint titers (here after referred to as vaccinia-binding titers) after MVA-BN vaccination (which have been shown to correlate with neutralizing antibody titers to Mpox after vaccinia vaccination21), and study the relationship between antibody levels and effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the kinetics of antibody decay over time to predict the duration of protection afforded by 1, 2 or 3 doses of vaccination. This work offers a data-driven approach to support public health decision making on Mpox vaccination and boosting campaigns.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In order to mitigate the inequities in health outcomes and healthcare access for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of India introduced antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 self-testing kits for self-administered use. In this study, we aimed to determine the usability of these nasal-sampling-based self-tests in a peer-assisted model among factory workers in Bengaluru. The mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 factory workers, spanning two sites from February to March 2022 in Bengaluru, India. Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test kit and the mobile application NAVICA for self-reporting results were used. A peer assistant distributed test kits, guided participants on conducting tests and using the app, and offered demonstrations with their own kit, ensuring no contact with the participants kits. Findings were encapsulated by an observer, who used standardized product-specific usability checklists and pictures of contrived results to assess the usability of the kit and mobile application, result interpretation, and the efficiency of peer instruction/demonstration. Additionally, a post-test survey and focus group discussions with selected participants and peer assistants were conducted to understand user perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to usability. Study findings show that the overall usability score of the test kit with peer assistance was 75.9%, rising to 80.7% for critical steps and 33.8% for all critical steps in uploading results through NAVICA. Additionally, it was seen that peer assistants provided accurate instructions and support for 93.4% of the tests. Among the critical steps in test kit use, maximum errors were made in sample collection and using the correct amount of buffer solution. Concordance between the participant and observer/NAVICA was 97.9%. 62.0% and 56.6% of the participants reported confidence in a) performing and interpreting the test and b) capturing and uploading their results using the mobile application with the assistance of a peer, respectively. Less than half the participants reported confidence in performing these steps independently. The study indicates that the COVID-19 nasal self-testing kit has good usability in factories peer-assisted workplace testing model. Such models can empower vulnerable worker groups to access early detection and self-care tools equitably.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge.

MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias.

FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups.

InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.

Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge</p>

        <p class="abstract">Misuse of antibiotics contributes to the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance. However, it is equally important to consider inevitable situations that may contribute to a rise in antibiotic resistance and implement best practices to ensure the minimality of their resulting adverse effects. A case in point is the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a strain of bacterium that has developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other lactams among long-term diabetic patients as observed in this study. Diabetes is associated with immunosuppression and foot ulcers, which require the constant use of antibiotics as prophylactics, as such, persons with this condition would hold bacterial populations subject to immense selective pressure and are therefore at increased risk for MRSA colonization. Furthermore, these individuals may serve as reservoirs and disseminate these highly drug-resistant strains on return to the general populace. This warranted an investigation into the prevalence of MRSA among diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital. A total of 50 samples were taken from the sampled Military Hospital by swabbing the participants&#39; skin, nose, and wounds aseptically, and 20 samples were acquired from non-diabetics to serve as controls. To culture the samples, blood, and mannitol salt agar were used. Bacteria were isolated and identified using Gram staining and other biochemical testing. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used with Muller-Hinton agar to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. According to the study&#39;s findings, antibiotic resistance was much higher among diabetic patients than among non-diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana.</p>
