D.\nScore: 243.4, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292649\nTo understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-a, IFN-g, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-a, and IFN-g) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.\nRisk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during multiple Omicron variant waves in the UK general population\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Stoesser, N.; Matthews, P.; Khera, T.; Gethings, O.; Diamond, I.; Studley, R.; Taylor, N.; peto, t. E.; Walker, A. S.; Pouwels, K.; Eyre, D. W.\nScore: 125.4, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292043\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [\u0026ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally \u003e1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those \u003e180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.\nNationally representative prevalence and determinants of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) amongst Mexican adults in 2022\nAuthors: Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Fermin-Martinez, C. A.; Fernandez-Chirino, L.; Ramirez-Garcia, D.; Vargas-Vazquez, A.; Basile-Alvarez, M. R.; Sanchez-Castro, P.; Nunez-Luna, A.; Antonio-Villa, N. E.\nScore: 51.1, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292475\nOBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data. METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [\u0026ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [\u0026ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights. RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [\u0026ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [\u0026ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance. CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.\nBooster dose of self-amplifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine vs. mRNA vaccine: a phase 3 comparison of ARCT-154 with Comirnaty\nAuthors: Oda, Y.; Kumagai, Y.; Kanai, M.; Iwama, Y.; Okura, I.; Minamida, T.; Yagi, Y.; Kurosawa, T.; Greener, B.; Zhang, Y.; Walson, J. L.\nScore: 35.3, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292597\nBackgroundLicensed mRNA vaccines demonstrated initial effectiveness against COVID-19 but require booster doses to broaden the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. There is an unmet need for novel highly immunogenic and broadly protective vaccines. We compared immunogenicity and tolerability of ARCT-154, a novel self-amplifying mRNA vaccine with the mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty(R). MethodsWe compared immune responses to ARCT-154 and Comirnaty booster doses in healthy 18- 77-year-old Japanese adults initially immunised with two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax(R)) then a third dose of Comirnaty at least 3 months previously. Neutralising antibodies were measured before and 28 days after booster vaccination. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response against Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 virus as geometric mean titre (GMT) ratios and seroresponse rates (SRR) of neutralising antibodies; key secondary endpoints included the immune response against the Omicron BA.4/5 variant and vaccine tolerability assessed using participant-completed electronic diaries. FindingsBetween December 13, 2022 and February 25, 2023 we enrolled 828 participants randomised 1:1 to receive ARCT-154 (n = 420) or Comirnaty (n = 408) booster doses. Four weeks after boosting, ARCT-154 induced higher Wuhan-Hu-1 neutralising antibodies GMTs than Comirnaty (5641 [95% CI: 4321, 7363] and 3934 [2993, 5169], respectively), a GMT ratio of 1{middle dot}43 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}26-1{middle dot}63), with SRR of 65{middle dot}2% (60{middle dot}2-69{middle dot}9) and 51{middle dot}6% (46{middle dot}4-56{middle dot}8) meeting the non-inferiority criteria. Respective anti-Omicron BA.4/5 GMTs were 2551 (1687-3859) and 1958 (1281-2993), a GMT ratio of 1{middle dot}30 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}07-1{middle dot}58), with SRR of 69{middle dot}9% (65{middle dot}0-74{middle dot}4) and 58{middle dot}0% (52{middle dot}8-63{middle dot}1), meeting the superiority criteria for ARCT-154 over Comirnaty. Booster doses of either ARCT-154 or Comirnaty were equally well-tolerated with no causally-associated severe or serious adverse events; 94{middle dot}8% and 96{middle dot}8% of ARCT-154 and Comirnaty vaccinees reported local reactions and 65{middle dot}7% and 62{middle dot}5% had solicited systemic adverse events. Events were mainly mild in severity, occurring and resolving within 3-4 days of vaccination. InterpretationImmune responses four weeks after an ARCT-154 booster dose in mRNA-immunised adults were higher than after a Comirnaty booster, meeting non-inferiority criteria against the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 virus, and superiority criteria against the Omicron BA.4/5 variant. FundingThe study was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare following a public invitation to bid for an urgent improvement project for vaccine manufacturing systems, fourth invitation, Grant number: 1212-3. Clinical Trials registration and identifierThe study was registered on the Japan Registry for Clinical Trials (jRCT 2071220080).\nEarly oral switch in low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection\nAuthors: Kaasch, A. J.; Lopez-Cortes, L. E.; Rodriguez-Bano, J.; Cisneros, J. M.; Navarro, D.; Faetkenheuer, G.; Jung, N.; Rieg, S.; Lepeule, R.; Coutte, L.; Bernard, L.; Lemaignen, A.; Koesters, K.; MacKenzie, C.

L.; Forestier, E.; Stocker, H.; Vitrat, V.; Tattevin, P.; Rommerskirchen, A.; Noret, M.; Adams, A.; Kern, W. V.; Hellmich, M.; Seifert, H.; SABATO group, Score: 103.7, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23291932\nBackgroundStaphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is treated with at least 14 days of intravenously administered antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early oral switch therapy in patients at low risk for SAB-related complications. MethodsIn an international non-inferiority trial, we randomized patients with SAB after 5 to 7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to either switch to an oral antimicrobial or to continue with intravenous standard therapy. Main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated SAB, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. Composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any SAB-related complication (relapsing SAB, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to SAB) within 90 days. Results213 patients were randomized into the intention-to-treat population. In the oral switch group, 14/108 (13%) participants reached the primary endpoint versus 13/105 (12%) in the standard therapy group (adjusted difference 0.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.8% to 9.1%). Participants in the oral switch group were discharged earlier (median hospital stay from SAB onset of 12 days versus 16 days; adjusted difference -3.1 days [95% CI -7.5 to 1.4]). There was no statistical difference in 30-day survival and complications of intravenous administration. More participants in the oral group experienced at least one serious adverse event (34% versus 26%, p=0.292). ConclusionOral switch was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk SAB. However, a careful assessment of patients for signs and symptoms of complicated SAB at time of presentation and thereafter is necessary before considering early oral switch therapy. The trial was registered as NCT01792804 in ClinicalTrials.gov, as DRKS00004741 in the German Clinical trials register, and as EudraCT 2013-000577-77.\nRapid Identification of Bacterial isolates Using Microfluidic Adaptive Channels and Multiplexed Fluorescence Microscopy\nAuthors: Chatzimichail, S.; Turner, P. B.; Feehily, C.; Farrar, A. E.; Crook, D.; Andersson, M.; Oakley, S.; Barrett, L.; El Sayyed, H.; Kyropoulos, J.; Nellaker, C.; Stoesser, N.; Kapanidis, A. N.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292615\nWe demonstrate the rapid capture, enrichment, and identification of bacterial pathogens using Adaptive Channel Bacterial Capture (ACBC) devices. Using controlled tuning of device backpressure in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices, we enable the controlled formation of capture regions capable of trapping bacteria from low cell density samples with near 100% capture efficiency. The technical demands to prepare such devices are much lower compared to conventional methods for bacterial trapping and can be achieved with simple benchtop fabrication methods. We demonstrate the capture and identification of seven species of bacteria with bacterial concentrations lower than 1000 cells/mL, including common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. We further demonstrate that species identification of the trapped bacteria can be undertaken in under one-hour using multiplexed 16S rRNA-FISH with identification accuracies of 73-99% with unsupervised classification methods.\nIncreased circulating fibronectin, depletion of natural IgM and heightened EBV, HSV-1 reactivation in ME/CFS and long COVID\nAuthors: Liu, Z.; Hollmann, C.; Kalanidhi, S.; Grothey, A.; Keating, S.; Mena-Palomo, I.; Lamer, S.; Schlosser, A.; Kaiping, A.; Scheller, C.; Sotzny, F.; Horn, A.; Nuernberger, C.; Cejka, V.; Afshar, B.; Bahmer, T.; Schreiber, S.; Janne Vehreschild, J.; Milljukov, O.; Schaefer, C.; Kretzler, L.; Keil, T.; Reese, J.-P.; Eichner, F.

K.\nScore: 472.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291827\nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.\nSystems immunology reveals the molecular mechanisms of heterogeneous influenza vaccine response in the elderly\nAuthors: Dileep Kumar, S.; Zoodsma, M.; Nguyen, N.; Pedroso, R.; Trittel, S.; Riese, P.; Bottey-Bataller, J.; Zhou, L.; Alaswad, A.; Arshad, H.; Netea, M.; Xu, C.-J.; Pessler, F.; Guzman, C. A.; Graca, L.; Li, Y.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292445\nVaccination-induced protection against influenza is greatly diminished and increasingly heterogeneous with age. We investigated longitudinally (up to five timepoints) a cohort of 234 elderly influenza vaccinees across two independent seasons including up to six modalities (multi-omics and immunological parameters). System-level analyses revealed responders exhibited time-dependent changes attributed to a productive vaccine response across all omics layers whereas non-responders did not follow such dynamics, suggestive of systemic dysregulation. Through multi-omics integration, we identified key metabolites and proteins and their likely role in immune response to vaccination. High pre-vaccination IL-15 concentrations negatively associated with antibody production, further supported by experimental validation in mice revealing an IL-15-driven NK-cell axis with a suppressing role on antibody production. Finally, we propose certain long-chain fatty acids as modulators of persistent inflammation in non-responders. Our findings highlight the potential for stratification of vaccinees and open avenues for possible pharmacological interventions to enhance vaccine responses. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPre-vaccination pro-inflammatory status impedes vaccine responsiveness in the elderly. C_LIO_LIMulti-omics integration reveals key molecules involved in vaccine response. C_LIO_LIHigh pre-vaccination concentrations of IL-15 suppresses vaccine response through NK cell activation.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy. Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [\u0026ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to \u003c4.0 log10 copies/milliliter. ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [\u0026ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene. Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.\nEnvironmental Surface Monitoring as a Noninvasive Method for SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in Community Settings: Lessons from a University Campus Study\nAuthors: Ali, S.; Cella, E.; Johnston, C.; Deichen, M.; Azarian, T.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292575\nEnvironmental testing of high-touch objects is a potential noninvasive approach for monitoring population-level trends of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses within a defined setting. We aimed to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 contamination on high-touch environmental surfaces, community level case incidence, and university student health data. Environmental swabs were collected from January 2022 to November 2022 from high-touch objects and surfaces from five locations on a large university campus in Florida, USA. RT-qPCR was used to detect and quantify viral RNA, and a subset of positive samples was analyzed by viral genome sequencing to identify circulating lineages. During the study period, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on 90.7% of 162 tested samples. Levels of environmental viral RNA correlated with trends in community-level activity and case reports from the student health center. A significant positive correlation was observed between the estimated viral gene copy number in environmental samples and the weekly confirmed cases at the university. Viral sequencing data from environmental samples identified lineages contemporaneously circulating in the local community and state based on genomic surveillance data. Further, we detected emerging variants in environmental samples prior to their identification by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results demonstrate the utility of viral monitoring on high-touch environmental surfaces for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at a community level. In communities with delayed or limited testing facilities, immediate environmental surface testing may considerably inform epidemic dynamics.

        <p class="abstract">To understand the roles of acute phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in PASC, we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR. Participants self-collected nasal specimens up to 21 times within the first 28 days after symptom onset; Interviewer-administered clinical questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment and days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom. Defining PASC as the presence of any symptom new or worse since infection reported at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-a, IFN-g, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. In comparison to those who fully recovered, those who developed PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, infectious virus, and N-antigen, longer duration of viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within the first 10 days of the acute phase of illness. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers, though there was a trend toward higher initial levels of certain markers (e.g., MCP-1, IFN-a, and IFN-g) in those who went on to develop PASC. Early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the early biological markers from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the natural history of PASC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [&amp;ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally &gt;1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those &gt;180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo characterize the epidemiology of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in Mexico during 2022 and identify potential predictors of PASC prevalence using nationally representative data.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the 2022 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) totaling 24,434 participants, representing 85,521,661 adults [&amp;ge;]20 years. PASC was defined using both the World Health Organization definition and a PASC score [&amp;ge;]12. Estimates of PASC prevalence were stratified by age, sex, rural vs. urban setting, social lag quartiles, number of reinfections, vaccination status and by periods of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants. Predictors of PASC were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted by survey weights.

RESULTSPersistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported by 12.44% (95%CI 11.89-12.99) of adults [&amp;ge;]20 years in Mexico during 2022. The most common persistent symptoms were musculoskeletal pain, headache, cough, loss of smell or taste, fever, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, anxiety, chest pain, and sleep disorders. PASC was present in 21.21% (95%CI 7.71-9.65) subjects with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Over 28.6% patients with PASC reported symptoms persistence [&amp;ge;]6 months and 14.05% reported incapacitating symptoms. Higher PASC prevalence was associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, depressive symptoms and living in states with high social lag. PASC prevalence, particularly its more severe forms, decreased with COVID-19 vaccination and for infections during periods of Omicron variant predominance.

CONCLUSIONSPASC implies a significant public health burden in Mexico as the COVID-19 pandemic transitions into endemicity. Promoting reinfection prevention and booster vaccination may be useful to reduce PASC burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLicensed mRNA vaccines demonstrated initial effectiveness against COVID-19 but require booster doses to broaden the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. There is an unmet need for novel highly immunogenic and broadly protective vaccines. We compared immunogenicity and tolerability of ARCT-154, a novel self-amplifying mRNA vaccine with the mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty(R).

MethodsWe compared immune responses to ARCT-154 and Comirnaty booster doses in healthy 18- 77-year-old Japanese adults initially immunised with two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty or Spikevax(R)) then a third dose of Comirnaty at least 3 months previously. Neutralising antibodies were measured before and 28 days after booster vaccination. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response against Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 virus as geometric mean titre (GMT) ratios and seroresponse rates (SRR) of neutralising antibodies; key secondary endpoints included the immune response against the Omicron BA.4/5 variant and vaccine tolerability assessed using participant-completed electronic diaries.

FindingsBetween December 13, 2022 and February 25, 2023 we enrolled 828 participants randomised 1:1 to receive ARCT-154 (n = 420) or Comirnaty (n = 408) booster doses. Four weeks after boosting, ARCT-154 induced higher Wuhan-Hu-1 neutralising antibodies GMTs than Comirnaty (5641 [95% CI: 4321, 7363] and 3934 [2993, 5169], respectively), a GMT ratio of 1{middle dot}43 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}26-1{middle dot}63), with SRR of 65{middle dot}2% (60{middle dot}2-69{middle dot}9) and 51{middle dot}6% (46{middle dot}4-56{middle dot}8) meeting the non-inferiority criteria. Respective anti-Omicron BA.4/5 GMTs were 2551 (1687-3859) and 1958 (1281-2993), a GMT ratio of 1{middle dot}30 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}07-1{middle dot}58), with SRR of 69{middle dot}9% (65{middle dot}0-74{middle dot}4) and 58{middle dot}0% (52{middle dot}8-63{middle dot}1), meeting the superiority criteria for ARCT-154 over Comirnaty. Booster doses of either ARCT-154 or Comirnaty were equally well-tolerated with no causally-associated severe or serious adverse events; 94{middle dot}8% and 96{middle dot}8% of ARCT-154 and Comirnaty vaccinees reported local reactions and 65{middle dot}7% and 62{middle dot}5% had solicited systemic adverse events. Events were mainly mild in severity, occurring and resolving within 3-4 days of vaccination.

InterpretationImmune responses four weeks after an ARCT-154 booster dose in mRNA-immunised adults were higher than after a Comirnaty booster, meeting non-inferiority criteria against the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 virus, and superiority criteria against the Omicron BA.4/5 variant.

FundingThe study was funded by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare following a public invitation to bid for an urgent improvement project for vaccine manufacturing systems, fourth invitation, Grant number: 1212-3.

Clinical Trials registration and identifierThe study was registered on the Japan Registry for Clinical Trials (jRCT 2071220080).</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is treated with at least 14 days of intravenously administered antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early oral switch therapy in patients at low risk for SAB-related complications.

MethodsIn an international non-inferiority trial, we randomized patients with SAB after 5 to 7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to either switch to an oral antimicrobial or to continue with intravenous standard therapy. Main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated SAB, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. Composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any SAB-related complication (relapsing SAB, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to SAB) within 90 days.

Results213 patients were randomized into the intention-to-treat population. In the oral switch group, 14/108 (13%) participants reached the primary endpoint versus 13/105 (12%) in the standard therapy group (adjusted difference 0.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.8% to 9.1%). Participants in the oral switch group were discharged earlier (median hospital stay from SAB onset of 12 days versus 16 days; adjusted difference -3.1 days [95% CI -7.5 to 1.4]). There was no statistical difference in 30-day survival and complications of intravenous administration. More participants in the oral group experienced at least one serious adverse event (34% versus 26%, p=0.292).

ConclusionOral switch was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk SAB. However, a careful assessment of patients for signs and symptoms of complicated SAB at time of presentation and thereafter is necessary before considering early oral switch therapy.

The trial was registered as NCT01792804 in ClinicalTrials.gov, as DRKS00004741 in the German Clinical trials register, and as EudraCT 2013-000577-77.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We demonstrate the rapid capture, enrichment, and identification of bacterial pathogens using Adaptive Channel Bacterial Capture (ACBC) devices. Using controlled tuning of device backpressure in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices, we enable the controlled formation of capture regions capable of trapping bacteria from low cell density samples with near 100% capture efficiency. The technical demands to prepare such devices are much lower compared to conventional methods for bacterial trapping and can be achieved with simple benchtop fabrication methods. We demonstrate the capture and identification of seven species of bacteria with bacterial concentrations lower than 1000 cells/mL, including common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. We further demonstrate that species identification of the trapped bacteria can be undertaken in under one-hour using multiplexed 16S rRNA-FISH with identification accuracies of 73-99% with unsupervised classification methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vaccination-induced protection against influenza is greatly diminished and increasingly heterogeneous with age. We investigated longitudinally (up to five timepoints) a cohort of 234 elderly influenza vaccinees across two independent seasons including up to six modalities (multi-omics and immunological parameters). System-level analyses revealed responders exhibited time-dependent changes attributed to a productive vaccine response across all omics layers whereas non-responders did not follow such dynamics, suggestive of systemic dysregulation. Through multi-omics integration, we identified key metabolites and proteins and their likely role in immune response to vaccination. High pre-vaccination IL-15 concentrations negatively associated with antibody production, further supported by experimental validation in mice revealing an IL-15-driven NK-cell axis with a suppressing role on antibody production. Finally, we propose certain long-chain fatty acids as modulators of persistent inflammation in non-responders. Our findings highlight the potential for stratification of vaccinees and open avenues for possible pharmacological interventions to enhance vaccine responses.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts.

ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [&amp;ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to &lt;4.0 log10 copies/milliliter.

ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [&amp;ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene.

Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental testing of high-touch objects is a potential noninvasive approach for monitoring population-level trends of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses within a defined setting. We aimed to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 contamination on high-touch environmental surfaces, community level case incidence, and university student health data. Environmental swabs were collected from January 2022 to November 2022 from high-touch objects and surfaces from five locations on a large university campus in Florida, USA. RT-qPCR was used to detect and quantify viral RNA, and a subset of positive samples was analyzed by viral genome sequencing to identify circulating lineages. During the study period, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on 90.7% of 162 tested samples. Levels of environmental viral RNA correlated with trends in community-level activity and case reports from the student health center. A significant positive correlation was observed between the estimated viral gene copy number in environmental samples and the weekly confirmed cases at the university. Viral sequencing data from environmental samples identified lineages contemporaneously circulating in the local community and state based on genomic surveillance data. Further, we detected emerging variants in environmental samples prior to their identification by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results demonstrate the utility of viral monitoring on high-touch environmental surfaces for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at a community level. In communities with delayed or limited testing facilities, immediate environmental surface testing may considerably inform epidemic dynamics.
