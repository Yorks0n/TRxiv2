Persistent Symptoms and Health and Performance Deterioration in Post-COVID-19, non-hospitalised University Students - A Cross-Sectional Study\nAuthors: Latifi, A.; Flegr, J.\nScore: 105.0, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297203\nMany individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from COVID-19. Current data are limited on the long-term trajectory of these symptoms and their prevalence in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first two years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the two-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.\nThe more symptoms the better? Covid-19 vaccine side effects and long-term neutralizing antibody response\nAuthors: Dutcher, E. G.; Epel, E. S.; Mason, A. E.; Hecht, F. M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 259.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nFace masks to control the source of respiratory infections: A systematic review of the scientific literature before and after COVID-19\nAuthors: Prasad, V.; Brown, E. M.; Haslam, A.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296616\nObjectiveTo examine the scientific literature on mask-use as source control to protect others from respiratory infections before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. DesignSystematic review. MethodsWe examined primary research on mask usage as a means of source control to protect others by reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and contrasted the literature published before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with that published afterward. Articles were obtained through a search of PubMed and a review of article references. March 1, 2020 was selected as the cutoff date to distinguish between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods. Results195 articles met our inclusion criteria. The sample included 55 articles on source control published before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 140 articles published after the pandemic began, representing a 154.5% increase. The percentage of randomized control trials (RCT) and cluster RCTs declined by 94.9% (p\u003c0.001), representing only 1.4% of the post-pandemic literature. The percentage of studies conducted on human subjects declined by 48.8% (p\u003c0.001), and the percentage of studies in healthcare facilities declined by 64.5% (p=0.019). One in 5 post-pandemic studies (21.4%) were conducted in \"real world\" settings; 1 in 10 post-pandemic studies (10.0%) were done with computer modeling. Study authors were significantly more supportive of masks as source control in the post-pandemic literature. ConclusionsThe quality of evidence in the published literature on masks as source control is lower after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with notable shifts in methodologies, research subjects, setting, and author tone.\nSocioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake among children and adolescents in Catalonia, Spain\nAuthors: Lopez-Sanchez, I.; Perramon, A.; Soriano-Arandes, A.; Prats, C.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Raventos, B.; Roel, E.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.23297134\nIMPORTANCEThe relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear. OBJECTIVETo investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain. DESIGN AND SETTINGPopulation-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children. PARTICIPANTSChildren (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data. EXPOSUREDeprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESCOVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1. RESULTSBefore COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIn this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.\nDynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a Large US population Over a Period of 12 Months\nAuthors: Karkanitsa, M.; Li, Y.; Valenti, S.; Spathies, J.; Kelly, S.; Yee, L.; Croker, J.

W.; Sundaresan, V.; Sundaresan, V.; Josyula, A.; Han, A.; Giurgea, L. T.; Angela Rosas, L.; Bean, R.; Athota, R.; Czajkowski, L.; Klump-Thomas, C.; Cervantes-Medina, A.; Gouzoulis, M.; Reed, S.; Graubard, B.; Hall, M. D.; Kalish, H.; Esposito, D.; Kimberly, R. P.; Reis, S.; Sadtler, K.; Memoli, M. J.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297329\nDue to a combination of asymptomatic or undiagnosed infections, the proportion of the United States population infected with SARS-CoV-2 was unclear from the beginning of the pandemic. We previously established a platform to screen for SARS-CoV-2 positivity across a representative proportion of the US population, from which we reported that almost 17 million Americans were estimated to have had undocumented infections in the Spring of 2020. Since then, vaccine rollout and prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants have further altered seropositivity trends within the United States population. To explore the longitudinal impacts of the pandemic and vaccine responses on seropositivity, we re-enrolled participants from our baseline study in a 6- and 12- month follow-up study to develop a longitudinal antibody profile capable of representing seropositivity within the United States during a critical period just prior to and during the initiation of vaccine rollout. Initial measurements showed that, since July 2020, seropositivity elevated within this population from 4.8% at baseline to 36.2% and 89.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We also evaluated nucleocapsid seropositivity and compared to spike seropositivity to identify trends in infection versus vaccination relative to baseline. These data serve as a window into a critical timeframe within the COVID-19 pandemic response and serve as a resource that could be used in subsequent respiratory illness outbreaks.\nPostacute Sequelae SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Vaccination Status: A Six-Month Latent Class Analysis\nAuthors: Sun, X.; DeShazo, J. P.; Anatale-Tardiff, L.; Di Fusco, M.; Allen, K. E.; Porter, T. M.; Coetzer, H.; Lopez, S. M. C.; Puzniak, L.; Cappelleri, J. C.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297332\nSymptoms post- SARS-CoV-2 infection may persist for months and cause significant impairment and impact to quality of life. Acute symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are well studied, yet data on clusters of symptoms over time, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), are limited. We aim to characterize PASC phenotypes by identifying symptom clusters over a six-month period following infection in individuals vaccinated (boosted and not) and those unvaccinated. Subjects with [\u0026ge;]1 self-reported symptom and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at CVS Health US test sites were recruited between January and April 2022. Patient-reported outcomes symptoms, heath-related quality of life (QoL), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) were captured at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-acute infection. Logistic regression and latent class analysis (LCA) were performed on 20 symptoms using baseline socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and vaccination status as well as EQ-5and WPAI results as covariables. Subjects with more symptoms were associated with lower health-related quality of life, and worse WPAI scores. LCA identified three phenotypes that are primarily differentiated by number of symptoms. These three phenotypes remained consistent across time periods. Vaccinated individuals were more likely to be in the low symptom burden latent classes at all time points compared to unvaccinated individuals.\nStabilizing the return to normal behavior in an epidemic\nAuthors: Berry, T.; Ferrari, M.; Sauer, T.; Greybush, S. J.; Ebeigbe, D.; Whalen, A. J.; Schiff, S. J.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.23287222\nPredicting the interplay between infectious disease and behavior has been an intractable problem because behavioral response is so varied. We introduce a general framework for feedback between incidence and behavior for an infectious disease. By identifying stable equilibria, we provide policy end-states that are self-managing and self-maintaining. We prove mathematically the existence of two new endemic equilibria depending on the vaccination rate: one in the presence of low vaccination but with reduced societal activity (the ``new normal\"), and one with return to normal activity but with vaccination rate below that required for disease elimination. This framework allows us to anticipate the long-term consequence of an emerging disease and design a vaccination response that optimizes public health and limits societal consequences.\nExploring the potential of a saliva-based, RNA-extraction-free PCR test for the multiplexed detection of key respiratory pathogens\nAuthors: Allicock, O. M.; Lin, T.-Y.; Fajardo, K. T.; Yolda-Carr, D.; Hislop, M.; Zuniga, D.; Platt, W.; Tuhoy, B.; Wang, J.; Wyllie, A. L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296240\nIntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens. MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at +4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([\u0026ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction. ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.\nXAV-19 a Glyco-Humanized polyclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 accelerates the recovery of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients and keeps its neutralizing activity against Omicron and its subvariants.\nAuthors: Poulakou, G.; Royer, P.-J.; Evgeniev, N.; Evanno, G.; Shneiker, F.; Marcelin, A.-G.; Vanhove, B.; Duvaux, O.; Marot, S.; Calvez, V.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296726\nBackgroundXAV-19 is a glyco-humanized swine polyclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2. The safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 was investigated in patients with a WHO score of 2 to 4 in the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. The activity of XAV-19 against Omicron and its subvariants was assessed in vitro. MethodsA phase II/III, multicentric randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 in inpatients with COVID-19 requiring or not oxygen therapy and outpatients not requiring oxygen (EUROXAV trial, NCT04928430). Most patients were not vaccinated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an aggravation of COVID-19 within 8 days after treatment. Binding and neutralization of Omicron or its subvariants by XAV-19 was investigated by ELISA or with a whole virus neutralization assay. ResultsPatients received either 150mg of XAV-19 (N=139) or placebo (N=140). Low enrolment forced the premature trial termination. XAV-19 was well tolerated. No difference in the primary endpoint, nor in the proportion with an improvement at day 8 (secondary endpoint) was observed between the 2 groups. For patients not requiring oxygen therapy, XAV-19 reduced the time to improvement significantly (7 days vs 14 days p=0.0159). Neutralizing activity against Omicron and BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4/5 and BQ1.1 subvariants was shown in vitro. ConclusionsXAV-19 did not reduce the aggravation in COVID-19 patients. While it did not bring any benefit to patients requiring oxygen, it reduced the time to improvement for patients not requiring oxygen (WHO score 2 or 3). These preliminary clinical data might indicate a therapeutic potential for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 requiring supplementation with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.\nHumoral and cellular immune responses following BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccination\nAuthors: Stankov, M. V.; Hoffmann, M.; Gutierrez, R.; Cossmann, A.; Morillas Ramos, G.; Graalmann, T.; Friedrichsen, M.; Ravens, I.; Tamara, I.; Ristenpart, J.; Schimrock, A.; Willenzon, S.; Ahrenstorff, G.; Witte, T.; Foerster, R.; Kempf, A.; Poehlmann, S.; Hammerschmidt, S. I.; Dopfer-Jablonka, A.; Behrens, G. M.\nScore: 89.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296545\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants efficiently evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, requiring vaccine adaptation. Here, we analyzed immunogenicity of an adapted vaccine, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5, which is currently used for booster vaccination. Booster vaccination significantly increased anti-Spike IgG, accompanied by expansion of cross-reactive memory B cells recognizing Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 spike variants. Geometric mean neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3, as well as cross-reactive responses against EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 increased significantly relative to pre-booster titers. Finally, the number of Wuhan and XBB.1.5 spike reactive IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells significantly increased after booster vaccination. In summary, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccination resulted in potent neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron XBB variants, including the recent Omicron variants EG.5.1 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), as well as XBB.1.5 reactive T cell responses, suggesting that booster vaccination will augment protection against these emerging variants.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Many individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from COVID-19. Current data are limited on the long-term trajectory of these symptoms and their prevalence in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first two years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the two-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the scientific literature on mask-use as source control to protect others from respiratory infections before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignSystematic review.

MethodsWe examined primary research on mask usage as a means of source control to protect others by reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and contrasted the literature published before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with that published afterward. Articles were obtained through a search of PubMed and a review of article references. March 1, 2020 was selected as the cutoff date to distinguish between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods.

Results195 articles met our inclusion criteria. The sample included 55 articles on source control published before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 140 articles published after the pandemic began, representing a 154.5% increase. The percentage of randomized control trials (RCT) and cluster RCTs declined by 94.9% (p&lt;0.001), representing only 1.4% of the post-pandemic literature. The percentage of studies conducted on human subjects declined by 48.8% (p&lt;0.001), and the percentage of studies in healthcare facilities declined by 64.5% (p=0.019). One in 5 post-pandemic studies (21.4%) were conducted in &#34;real world&#34; settings; 1 in 10 post-pandemic studies (10.0%) were done with computer modeling. Study authors were significantly more supportive of masks as source control in the post-pandemic literature.

ConclusionsThe quality of evidence in the published literature on masks as source control is lower after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with notable shifts in methodologies, research subjects, setting, and author tone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IMPORTANCEThe relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and COVID-19 infection and vaccination among children and adolescents remains unclear.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the association between deprivation and COVID-19 vaccine uptake and infection among children and adolescents before and after the vaccination rollout in Catalonia, Spain.

DESIGN AND SETTINGPopulation-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from the Information System for Research in Primary Care. Individuals were followed 3 months before the start of the vaccination campaign in Spain and 3 months after the vaccination rollout among adolescents and children.

PARTICIPANTSChildren (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-15 years) with at least 1 year of prior history observation available and without missing deprivation data.

EXPOSUREDeprivation, assessed using an ecological socioeconomic deprivation index (SDI) score for census tract urban areas and categorized into quintiles.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESCOVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. For each outcome, we calculated cumulative incidence and crude Cox proportional-hazard models by SDI quintiles, and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake relative to the least deprived quintile, Q1.

RESULTSBefore COVID-19 vaccination rollout, 290,625 children and 179,685 adolescents were analyzed. Increased HR of deprivation was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in both children (Q5: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47 - 1.63]) and adolescents (Q5: 1.36 [95% CI, 1.29 - 1.43]). After the rollout, this pattern changed among children, with lower risk of infection in more deprived areas (Q5: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.61 - 0.64]). Vaccine uptake was higher among adolescents (72.6%) than children (44.8%), but in both age groups, non-vaccination was more common among those living in more deprived areas (39.3% and 74.6% in Q1 vs. 26.5% and 66.9% in Q5 among children and adolescents, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIn this cohort study, children and adolescents living in deprived areas were at higher risk of COVID-19 non-vaccination. Socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 infection were also evident before vaccine rollout, with a higher infection risk in deprived areas across age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in the association between deprivation and infections among children after the vaccine rollout were likely due to testing disparities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to a combination of asymptomatic or undiagnosed infections, the proportion of the United States population infected with SARS-CoV-2 was unclear from the beginning of the pandemic. We previously established a platform to screen for SARS-CoV-2 positivity across a representative proportion of the US population, from which we reported that almost 17 million Americans were estimated to have had undocumented infections in the Spring of 2020. Since then, vaccine rollout and prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants have further altered seropositivity trends within the United States population. To explore the longitudinal impacts of the pandemic and vaccine responses on seropositivity, we re-enrolled participants from our baseline study in a 6- and 12- month follow-up study to develop a longitudinal antibody profile capable of representing seropositivity within the United States during a critical period just prior to and during the initiation of vaccine rollout. Initial measurements showed that, since July 2020, seropositivity elevated within this population from 4.8% at baseline to 36.2% and 89.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We also evaluated nucleocapsid seropositivity and compared to spike seropositivity to identify trends in infection versus vaccination relative to baseline. These data serve as a window into a critical timeframe within the COVID-19 pandemic response and serve as a resource that could be used in subsequent respiratory illness outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Symptoms post- SARS-CoV-2 infection may persist for months and cause significant impairment and impact to quality of life. Acute symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are well studied, yet data on clusters of symptoms over time, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), are limited. We aim to characterize PASC phenotypes by identifying symptom clusters over a six-month period following infection in individuals vaccinated (boosted and not) and those unvaccinated. Subjects with [&amp;ge;]1 self-reported symptom and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at CVS Health US test sites were recruited between January and April 2022. Patient-reported outcomes symptoms, heath-related quality of life (QoL), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) were captured at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-acute infection. Logistic regression and latent class analysis (LCA) were performed on 20 symptoms using baseline socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and vaccination status as well as EQ-5and WPAI results as covariables. Subjects with more symptoms were associated with lower health-related quality of life, and worse WPAI scores. LCA identified three phenotypes that are primarily differentiated by number of symptoms. These three phenotypes remained consistent across time periods. Vaccinated individuals were more likely to be in the low symptom burden latent classes at all time points compared to unvaccinated individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predicting the interplay between infectious disease and behavior has been an intractable problem because behavioral response is so varied. We introduce a general framework for feedback between incidence and behavior for an infectious disease. By identifying stable equilibria, we provide policy end-states that are self-managing and self-maintaining. We prove mathematically the existence of two new endemic equilibria depending on the vaccination rate: one in the presence of low vaccination but with reduced societal activity (the ``new normal&#34;), and one with return to normal activity but with vaccination rate below that required for disease elimination. This framework allows us to anticipate the long-term consequence of an emerging disease and design a vaccination response that optimizes public health and limits societal consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens.

MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at &#43;4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([&amp;ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction.

ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundXAV-19 is a glyco-humanized swine polyclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2. The safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 was investigated in patients with a WHO score of 2 to 4 in the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. The activity of XAV-19 against Omicron and its subvariants was assessed in vitro.

MethodsA phase II/III, multicentric randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 in inpatients with COVID-19 requiring or not oxygen therapy and outpatients not requiring oxygen (EUROXAV trial, NCT04928430). Most patients were not vaccinated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an aggravation of COVID-19 within 8 days after treatment. Binding and neutralization of Omicron or its subvariants by XAV-19 was investigated by ELISA or with a whole virus neutralization assay.

ResultsPatients received either 150mg of XAV-19 (N=139) or placebo (N=140). Low enrolment forced the premature trial termination. XAV-19 was well tolerated. No difference in the primary endpoint, nor in the proportion with an improvement at day 8 (secondary endpoint) was observed between the 2 groups. For patients not requiring oxygen therapy, XAV-19 reduced the time to improvement significantly (7 days vs 14 days p=0.0159). Neutralizing activity against Omicron and BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4/5 and BQ1.1 subvariants was shown in vitro.

ConclusionsXAV-19 did not reduce the aggravation in COVID-19 patients. While it did not bring any benefit to patients requiring oxygen, it reduced the time to improvement for patients not requiring oxygen (WHO score 2 or 3). These preliminary clinical data might indicate a therapeutic potential for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 requiring supplementation with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants efficiently evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, requiring vaccine adaptation. Here, we analyzed immunogenicity of an adapted vaccine, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5, which is currently used for booster vaccination. Booster vaccination significantly increased anti-Spike IgG, accompanied by expansion of cross-reactive memory B cells recognizing Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 spike variants. Geometric mean neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3, as well as cross-reactive responses against EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 increased significantly relative to pre-booster titers. Finally, the number of Wuhan and XBB.1.5 spike reactive IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells significantly increased after booster vaccination. In summary, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccination resulted in potent neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron XBB variants, including the recent Omicron variants EG.5.1 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), as well as XBB.1.5 reactive T cell responses, suggesting that booster vaccination will augment protection against these emerging variants.</p>
