For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs) vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented. ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were numerically higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86 that were similar to those against XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines. ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1) as well as the recently emerged BA.2.86 variant. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results overall indicate that the XBB.1.5-containing mRNA-1273.815 vaccine has the potential to provide protection against these emerging variants and support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.\nEvolution and neutralization escape of the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 subvariant\nAuthors: Khan, K.; Lustig, G.; Reedoy, K.; Jule, Z.; Romer, C.; Karim, F.; Ganga, Y.; Bernstein, M.; Baig, Z.; Mahlangu, B.; Mnguni, A.; Nzimande, A.; Stock, N.; Kekana, D.; Ntozini, B.; van Deventer, C.; Marshall, T.; Manickchund, N.; Gosnell, B.; Lessells, R.; Abdool Karim, Q.; Abdool Karim, S. S.; Moosa, Y.; de Oliveira, T.; von Gottberg, A.; Wolter, N.; Neher, R. A.; Sigal, A.\nScore: 445.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295250\nOmicron BA.2.86 subvariant differs from Omicron BA.2 as well as recently circulating variants by over 30 mutations in the spike protein alone. Here we report on the first isolation of the live BA.2.86 subvariant from a diagnostic swab collected in South Africa which we tested for escape from neutralizing antibodies and viral replication properties in cell culture. BA.2.86 did not have significantly more escape than Omicron XBB.1.5 from neutralizing immunity elicited by infection of Omicron subvariants ranging from BA.1 to XBB, either by infection alone or as breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals. Neutralization escape was present relative to earlier strains: BA.2.86 showed extensive escape both relative to ancestral virus in sera from pre-Omicron vaccinated individuals and relative to Omicron BA.1 in sera from Omicron BA.1 infected individuals. We did not observe substantial differences in viral properties in cell culture relative to XBB.1.5. Both BA.2.86 and XBB.1.5 produced infection foci of similar size, had similar cytopathic effect (both lower than ancestral SARS-CoV-2), and had similar replication dynamics. We also investigated the relationship of BA.2.86 to BA.2 sequences and found that the closest were BA.2 samples from Southern Africa circulating in early 2022. These observations suggest that BA.2.86 is more closely related to sequences from Southern Africa than other regions and so may have evolved there, and that evolution led to escape from neutralizing antibodies similar in scale to recently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.\nQuantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing over the course of COVID-19 infection\nAuthors: Lane, G.; Zhou, G.; Hultquist, J. F.; Simons, L. M.; Lorenzo-Redondo, R.; Ozer, E. A.; McCarthy, D. M.; Ison, M. G.; Achenbach, C. J.; Wang, X.; Wai, C. M.; Wyatt, E.; Aalsburg, A.; Yang, Q.; Noto, T.; Alisoltani, A.; Ysselstein, D.; Awatramani, R.; Murphy, R.; Theron, G.; Zelano, C.\nScore: 408.3, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138\nSARS-CoV-2 is spread through exhaled breath of infected individuals. A fundamental question in understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is how much virus an individual is exhaling into the environment while they breathe, over the course of their infection. Research on viral load dynamics during COVID-19 infection has focused on internal swab specimens, which provide a measure of viral loads inside the respiratory tract, but not on breath. Therefore, the dynamics of viral shedding on exhaled breath over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we collected exhaled breath specimens from COVID-19 patients and used RTq-PCR to show that numbers of exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies during COVID-19 infection do not decrease significantly until day 8 from symptom-onset. COVID-19-positive participants exhaled an average of 80 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copies per minute during the first 8 days of infection, with significant variability both between and within individuals, including spikes over 800 copies a minute in some patients. After day 8, there was a steep drop to levels nearing the limit of detection, persisting for up to 20 days. We further found that levels of exhaled viral RNA increased with self-rated symptom-severity, though individual variation was high. Levels of exhaled viral RNA did not differ across age, sex, time of day, vaccination status or viral variant. Our data provide a fine-grained, direct measure of the number of SARS-CoV-2 viral copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing--including 312 breath specimens collected multiple times daily over the course of infection--in order to fill an important gap in our understanding of the time course of exhaled viral loads in COVID-19.\nEmerging Links Between COVID-19 and Cardiovascular \u0026 Cerebrovascular Thromboembolic Events: A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Agarwal, A.; Panjiyar, B. K.; Patel, D. M.; Ghotra, M.; Husain, M. G. N.; Upadhyay, R. B.\nScore: 373.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295067\nCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, initially identified as a respiratory illness, has increasingly been linked to a broader range of organ complications. This systematic review explores the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health, focusing on thromboembolic events in post-COVID patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to July 2023, utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were analyzed for outcomes and associations between COVID-19 and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The review includes 6 studies involving over 12 million patients, demonstrating a strong connection between COVID-19 and elevated risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboembolic events. The risk of these events is evident in conditions such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias. The burden of these events beyond the acute phase of the disease is concerning, warranting further exploration of long-term implications. Variability in event rates among different cohorts and healthcare settings underscores the need for understanding underlying factors influencing these differences. Potential mechanisms behind these events include endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and viral invasion. Implications for public health policies, clinical guidelines, and future research directions are discussed. This review serves as a valuable resource for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers to enhance patient care, outcomes, and preparedness for future waves of COVID-19 infections. However, there remain unexplored aspects of the COVID-19 and thromboembolic events relationship, urging further investigations into mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic interventions.\nComparison of COVID-19 and Influenza-Related Outcomes in the United States during Fall-Winter 2022-2023\nAuthors: Kopel, H.; Bogdanov, A.; Winer-Jones, J.; Adams, C.; Winer, I.; Bonafede, M.; Nguyen, V. H.; Mansi, J. A.\nScore: 126.2, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295262\nBackgroundThree years into the pandemic, SARS-COV-2 remains a significant burden in comparison to other respiratory illnesses; however, many of the monitoring tools available during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic have been phased out, making it more difficult to track the current burden of outpatient medical encounters and hospitalizations, especially for at-risk groups. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the frequency and severity of medically-attended COVID-19 and influenza during peak influenza activity in the pediatric (0-17), adult (18-64), and older adult (65+) populations and characterize the prevalence of underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional analysis of individuals in the Veradigm Health Insights EHR Database linked to Komodo claims data with a medical encounter of claim between October 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. We captured age, sex, and underlying medical conditions associated with higher risk for severe COVID-19 during a 12-month baseline period. We identified patients with medical encounters with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or influenza between October 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, and stratified them into 5 mutually exclusive categories based on the highest level of care received with that diagnosis during the season (intensive care unit [ICU] \u003e hospitalization without ICU \u003e emergency department \u003e urgent care \u003e other outpatient). ResultsAmong the 23,526,196 individuals in the dataset, 5.0% had a COVID-19-related medical encounter, and 3.0% had an influenza-related medical encounter during the 6 month observation period. The incidence of hospitalizations with a COVID-19 diagnosis was 4.6 times higher than the incidence of hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis. Hospitalizations with COVID-19 were higher in all age groups. Nearly all adults hospitalized with COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition, but 25.8% of 0-5-year-olds and 18.3% of 6-17-year-olds had no underlying medical conditions. ConclusionsCOVID-19 continues to place a heavy burden on the United States healthcare system and was associated with more medical encounters in all age groups, including hospitalizations, than influenza during a 6-month period that included the 2022-2023 peak influenza activity.\nPre-dominance of dengue non-cross-reacting SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies during the Omicron era and their role in the ADE-mediated surge of Dengue virus serotype 3\nAuthors: Sarker, S.; Dutta, C.; Mallick, A.; Das, S.; Das Chowdhury, C.; De, A.; Gorai, S.; Biswas, S.\nScore: 28.0, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295136\nIn India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave (2020-21) gradually faded away with the advent of the Omicron variants (2021-present). Dengue incidences were observably less in Southeast Asia during the active years of the pandemic (2020-21). However, Dengue virus type 3 (DV3) cases were increasingly reported in India and many other dengue-endemic countries concurrent with the progression of the Omicron wave since 2022. This observation prompted us to investigate the current state of cross-reactivity between prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and different DV serotypes. Fifty-five COVID-19 serum samples (collected between January-September, 2022) and three pre-pandemic healthy serum samples were tested for DV or SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) using the lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab)-positive samples were further tested for their ability to cross-neutralize DV types 1-4 (DV1-4) in Huh7 cell lines. Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DV diminished with the shift from Delta to Omicron prevalence. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV cross-reactive neutralized all DV serotypes, including DV3. However, Omicron wave serum samples were predominantly DV non-cross-reactive (about 70%) in LFIAs and coincided with the prevalence of BA.2 Omicron variant. They also cross-neutralized DV1, 2 and 4 but enhanced DV3 infectivity as evident from increased DV3 titres in virus neutralization test (VNT) compared to control serum samples. In conclusion, DV non-cross-reactive COVID-19 serum samples are becoming increasingly prominent in the present times. These non-cross-reactive serums could neutralize DV1, 2 and 4 but they are contributing to the surge in DV3 cases worldwide by means of ADE.\nKinetics and durability of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination\nAuthors: Srivastava, K.; Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Gleason, C.; Monahan, B.; Singh, G.; Abbad, A.; Tcheou, J.; Raskin, A.; Kleiner, G.; van Bakel, H.; Sordillo, E. M.; PARIS Study Group, ; Krammer, F. M.; Simon, V.\nScore: 457.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294679\nWe analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using \u003e8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.\nCirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum in Equatorial Guinea\nAuthors: Lopez-Farfan, D.; Ncogo, P.; Oki, C.; Riloha, M.; Ondo, V.; Cano-Jimenez, P.; Martinez-Martinez, F. J.; Comas, I.; Irigoyen, N.; Berzosa, P.; Llanes, A. B.; Gomez-Diaz, E.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295464\nThe impact of COVID-19 in Africa has been a big concern since the beginning of the pandemic. However, low incidence of COVID-19 case severity and mortality has been reported in many African countries, although data are highly heterogeneous and, in some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, very scarce. Many of these regions are also the cradle of endemic infectious diseases like malaria. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity and origin of circulating variants as well as the frequency of co-infections with malaria in Equatorial Guinea. For this purpose, we conducted antigen diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, and microscopy examinations for malaria of 1,556 volunteers at six health centres in Bioko and Bata from June to October 2021. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were also taken for molecular detection of SARS-COV-2 by RT-qPCR and whole genome viral sequencing. We report 3.0% of SARS-CoV-2 and 24.4% of malaria prevalence over the sampling in Equatorial Guinea. SARS-CoV-2 cases were found at a similar frequency in all age groups, whereas the age groups most frequently affected by malaria were children (36.8% [95% CI 30.9-42.7]) and teenagers (34.7% [95% CI 29.5-39.9]). We found six cases of confirmed co-infection of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 distributed among all age groups, representing a 0.4% frequency of co-infection in the whole sampled population. Interestingly, the majority of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were mild. We obtained the genome sequences of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, most of which belong to the lineage Delta (AY.43) and that according to our pandemic-scale phylogenies were introduced from Europe in multiple occasions (7 transmission groups and 17 unique introductions). This study is relevant in providing first-time estimates of the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this malaria-endemic country, with the identification of circulating variants, their origin, and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection.\nEffect of Higher-Dose Fluvoxamine vs Placebo on Time to Sustained Recovery in Outpatients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial\nAuthors: Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-6 Study Group and Investigators, ; Naggie, S.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295424\nBackgroundThe impact of fluvoxamine in reducing symptom duration among outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains uncertain. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily, compared with placebo, for treating mild to moderate COVID-19. MethodsThe ACTIV-6 platform randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between August 25, 2022, and January 20, 2023, 1175 participants were enrolled at 103 US sites for evaluating fluvoxamine; participants were age [\u0026ge;]30 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and [\u0026ge;]2 acute COVID-19 symptoms for [\u0026le;]7 days. Participants were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 50 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 100 mg twice daily for 12 additional days or to placebo. The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery (defined as at least 3 consecutive days without symptoms). Secondary outcomes included time to death; time to hospitalization or death; a composite of hospitalization, urgent care visit, emergency department visit, or death; COVID clinical progression scale; and difference in mean time unwell. ResultsAmong participants who were randomized and received study drug, the median age was 50 years (IQR 40-60), 66% were female, 45% identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 77% reported [\u0026ge;]2 doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Among 589 participants who received fluvoxamine and 586 who received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not observed (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% credible interval, 0.89-1.09; P(efficacy) = 0.4]). Additionally, unadjusted, median time to sustained recovery was 10 days (95% CI 10-11) in both the intervention and placebo group. No deaths were reported. Thirty-five participants reported healthcare utilization events (a priori defined as death, hospitalization, emergency department/urgent care visit); 14 in the fluvoxamine group compared with 21 in the placebo group (HR 0.69; 95% CrI 0.27-1.21; P(efficacy)=0.86) There were 7 serious adverse events in 6 participants (2 with fluvoxamine and 4 with placebo). ConclusionsAmong outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, treatment with fluvoxamine does not reduce duration of COVID-19 symptoms.

K.; Burke, P. C.; Nowacki, A. S.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 5130.3, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackground. The CDC recently defined being 'up-to-date' on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those 'up-to-date' and 'not up-to-date'. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the 'up-to-date' and 'not up-to-date' states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and number of prior vaccine doses. Results. COVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the 'not up-to-date' than the 'up-to-date' state. On multivariable analysis, being 'up-to-date' was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.05; 95% C.I., 0.88-1.25; P-value, 0.58). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered 'up-to-date' after 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. Conclusions. Since the XBB lineages became dominant, adults 'up-to-date' on COVID-19 vaccination by the CDC definition do not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those 'not up-to-date', bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSubvariants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) omicron XBB-lineage have the potential to escape immunity provided by prior infection or vaccination. For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs) vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented.

ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were numerically higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86 that were similar to those against XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines.

ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1) as well as the recently emerged BA.2.86 variant. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results overall indicate that the XBB.1.5-containing mRNA-1273.815 vaccine has the potential to provide protection against these emerging variants and support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Omicron BA.2.86 subvariant differs from Omicron BA.2 as well as recently circulating variants by over 30 mutations in the spike protein alone. Here we report on the first isolation of the live BA.2.86 subvariant from a diagnostic swab collected in South Africa which we tested for escape from neutralizing antibodies and viral replication properties in cell culture. BA.2.86 did not have significantly more escape than Omicron XBB.1.5 from neutralizing immunity elicited by infection of Omicron subvariants ranging from BA.1 to XBB, either by infection alone or as breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals. Neutralization escape was present relative to earlier strains: BA.2.86 showed extensive escape both relative to ancestral virus in sera from pre-Omicron vaccinated individuals and relative to Omicron BA.1 in sera from Omicron BA.1 infected individuals. We did not observe substantial differences in viral properties in cell culture relative to XBB.1.5. Both BA.2.86 and XBB.1.5 produced infection foci of similar size, had similar cytopathic effect (both lower than ancestral SARS-CoV-2), and had similar replication dynamics. We also investigated the relationship of BA.2.86 to BA.2 sequences and found that the closest were BA.2 samples from Southern Africa circulating in early 2022. These observations suggest that BA.2.86 is more closely related to sequences from Southern Africa than other regions and so may have evolved there, and that evolution led to escape from neutralizing antibodies similar in scale to recently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 is spread through exhaled breath of infected individuals. A fundamental question in understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is how much virus an individual is exhaling into the environment while they breathe, over the course of their infection. Research on viral load dynamics during COVID-19 infection has focused on internal swab specimens, which provide a measure of viral loads inside the respiratory tract, but not on breath. Therefore, the dynamics of viral shedding on exhaled breath over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we collected exhaled breath specimens from COVID-19 patients and used RTq-PCR to show that numbers of exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies during COVID-19 infection do not decrease significantly until day 8 from symptom-onset. COVID-19-positive participants exhaled an average of 80 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copies per minute during the first 8 days of infection, with significant variability both between and within individuals, including spikes over 800 copies a minute in some patients. After day 8, there was a steep drop to levels nearing the limit of detection, persisting for up to 20 days. We further found that levels of exhaled viral RNA increased with self-rated symptom-severity, though individual variation was high. Levels of exhaled viral RNA did not differ across age, sex, time of day, vaccination status or viral variant. Our data provide a fine-grained, direct measure of the number of SARS-CoV-2 viral copies exhaled per minute during natural breathing--including 312 breath specimens collected multiple times daily over the course of infection--in order to fill an important gap in our understanding of the time course of exhaled viral loads in COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, initially identified as a respiratory illness, has increasingly been linked to a broader range of organ complications. This systematic review explores the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health, focusing on thromboembolic events in post-COVID patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to July 2023, utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were analyzed for outcomes and associations between COVID-19 and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The review includes 6 studies involving over 12 million patients, demonstrating a strong connection between COVID-19 and elevated risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboembolic events. The risk of these events is evident in conditions such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias. The burden of these events beyond the acute phase of the disease is concerning, warranting further exploration of long-term implications. Variability in event rates among different cohorts and healthcare settings underscores the need for understanding underlying factors influencing these differences. Potential mechanisms behind these events include endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and viral invasion. Implications for public health policies, clinical guidelines, and future research directions are discussed. This review serves as a valuable resource for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers to enhance patient care, outcomes, and preparedness for future waves of COVID-19 infections. However, there remain unexplored aspects of the COVID-19 and thromboembolic events relationship, urging further investigations into mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThree years into the pandemic, SARS-COV-2 remains a significant burden in comparison to other respiratory illnesses; however, many of the monitoring tools available during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic have been phased out, making it more difficult to track the current burden of outpatient medical encounters and hospitalizations, especially for at-risk groups. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the frequency and severity of medically-attended COVID-19 and influenza during peak influenza activity in the pediatric (0-17), adult (18-64), and older adult (65&#43;) populations and characterize the prevalence of underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional analysis of individuals in the Veradigm Health Insights EHR Database linked to Komodo claims data with a medical encounter of claim between October 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. We captured age, sex, and underlying medical conditions associated with higher risk for severe COVID-19 during a 12-month baseline period. We identified patients with medical encounters with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or influenza between October 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, and stratified them into 5 mutually exclusive categories based on the highest level of care received with that diagnosis during the season (intensive care unit [ICU] &gt; hospitalization without ICU &gt; emergency department &gt; urgent care &gt; other outpatient).

ResultsAmong the 23,526,196 individuals in the dataset, 5.0% had a COVID-19-related medical encounter, and 3.0% had an influenza-related medical encounter during the 6 month observation period. The incidence of hospitalizations with a COVID-19 diagnosis was 4.6 times higher than the incidence of hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis. Hospitalizations with COVID-19 were higher in all age groups. Nearly all adults hospitalized with COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition, but 25.8% of 0-5-year-olds and 18.3% of 6-17-year-olds had no underlying medical conditions.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 continues to place a heavy burden on the United States healthcare system and was associated with more medical encounters in all age groups, including hospitalizations, than influenza during a 6-month period that included the 2022-2023 peak influenza activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave (2020-21) gradually faded away with the advent of the Omicron variants (2021-present). Dengue incidences were observably less in Southeast Asia during the active years of the pandemic (2020-21). However, Dengue virus type 3 (DV3) cases were increasingly reported in India and many other dengue-endemic countries concurrent with the progression of the Omicron wave since 2022. This observation prompted us to investigate the current state of cross-reactivity between prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and different DV serotypes.

Fifty-five COVID-19 serum samples (collected between January-September, 2022) and three pre-pandemic healthy serum samples were tested for DV or SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) using the lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab)-positive samples were further tested for their ability to cross-neutralize DV types 1-4 (DV1-4) in Huh7 cell lines.

Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DV diminished with the shift from Delta to Omicron prevalence. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV cross-reactive neutralized all DV serotypes, including DV3. However, Omicron wave serum samples were predominantly DV non-cross-reactive (about 70%) in LFIAs and coincided with the prevalence of BA.2 Omicron variant. They also cross-neutralized DV1, 2 and 4 but enhanced DV3 infectivity as evident from increased DV3 titres in virus neutralization test (VNT) compared to control serum samples.

In conclusion, DV non-cross-reactive COVID-19 serum samples are becoming increasingly prominent in the present times. These non-cross-reactive serums could neutralize DV1, 2 and 4 but they are contributing to the surge in DV3 cases worldwide by means of ADE.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using &gt;8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of COVID-19 in Africa has been a big concern since the beginning of the pandemic. However, low incidence of COVID-19 case severity and mortality has been reported in many African countries, although data are highly heterogeneous and, in some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, very scarce. Many of these regions are also the cradle of endemic infectious diseases like malaria. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity and origin of circulating variants as well as the frequency of co-infections with malaria in Equatorial Guinea. For this purpose, we conducted antigen diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, and microscopy examinations for malaria of 1,556 volunteers at six health centres in Bioko and Bata from June to October 2021. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were also taken for molecular detection of SARS-COV-2 by RT-qPCR and whole genome viral sequencing. We report 3.0% of SARS-CoV-2 and 24.4% of malaria prevalence over the sampling in Equatorial Guinea. SARS-CoV-2 cases were found at a similar frequency in all age groups, whereas the age groups most frequently affected by malaria were children (36.8% [95% CI 30.9-42.7]) and teenagers (34.7% [95% CI 29.5-39.9]). We found six cases of confirmed co-infection of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 distributed among all age groups, representing a 0.4% frequency of co-infection in the whole sampled population. Interestingly, the majority of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were mild. We obtained the genome sequences of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, most of which belong to the lineage Delta (AY.43) and that according to our pandemic-scale phylogenies were introduced from Europe in multiple occasions (7 transmission groups and 17 unique introductions). This study is relevant in providing first-time estimates of the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this malaria-endemic country, with the identification of circulating variants, their origin, and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe impact of fluvoxamine in reducing symptom duration among outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains uncertain. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily, compared with placebo, for treating mild to moderate COVID-19.

MethodsThe ACTIV-6 platform randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between August 25, 2022, and January 20, 2023, 1175 participants were enrolled at 103 US sites for evaluating fluvoxamine; participants were age [&amp;ge;]30 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and [&amp;ge;]2 acute COVID-19 symptoms for [&amp;le;]7 days. Participants were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 50 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 100 mg twice daily for 12 additional days or to placebo. The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery (defined as at least 3 consecutive days without symptoms). Secondary outcomes included time to death; time to hospitalization or death; a composite of hospitalization, urgent care visit, emergency department visit, or death; COVID clinical progression scale; and difference in mean time unwell.

ResultsAmong participants who were randomized and received study drug, the median age was 50 years (IQR 40-60), 66% were female, 45% identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 77% reported [&amp;ge;]2 doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Among 589 participants who received fluvoxamine and 586 who received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not observed (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% credible interval, 0.89-1.09; P(efficacy) = 0.4]). Additionally, unadjusted, median time to sustained recovery was 10 days (95% CI 10-11) in both the intervention and placebo group. No deaths were reported. Thirty-five participants reported healthcare utilization events (a priori defined as death, hospitalization, emergency department/urgent care visit); 14 in the fluvoxamine group compared with 21 in the placebo group (HR 0.69; 95% CrI 0.27-1.21; P(efficacy)=0.86) There were 7 serious adverse events in 6 participants (2 with fluvoxamine and 4 with placebo).

ConclusionsAmong outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, treatment with fluvoxamine does not reduce duration of COVID-19 symptoms.

        <p class="abstract">Background. The CDC recently defined being &#39;up-to-date&#39; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#39;up-to-date&#39; and &#39;not up-to-date&#39;. Methods. Employees of Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#39;up-to-date&#39; and &#39;not up-to-date&#39; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and number of prior vaccine doses. Results. COVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#39;not up-to-date&#39; than the &#39;up-to-date&#39; state. On multivariable analysis, being &#39;up-to-date&#39; was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.05; 95% C.I., 0.88-1.25; P-value, 0.58). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#39;up-to-date&#39; after 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. Conclusions. Since the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#39;up-to-date&#39; on COVID-19 vaccination by the CDC definition do not have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#39;not up-to-date&#39;, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.</p>
