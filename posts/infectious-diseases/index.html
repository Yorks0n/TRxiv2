C.; Scrape, S.; Pannu, S. R.; Liu, S.-L.; Vilgelm, A.; Wijeratne, S.; Bednash, J. S.; Demberg, T.; Funderburg, N. T.; Liyanage, N.\nScore: 36.4, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298322\nClinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.\nPhenotypic and genomic analysis of a large-scale Corynebacterium diphtheriae outbreak among migrant populations in Europe\nAuthors: Hoefer, A.; Seth-Smith, H. M.; Palma, F.; Schindler, S.; Freschi, L.; Dangel, A.; Berger, A.; D'Aeth, J. C.; 2022 European diphtheria Consortium, ; Indra, A.; Fry, N. K.; Palm, D.; Sing, A.; Brisse, S.; Egli, A.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23297228\nBackgroundIncreased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak. MethodsAll 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied. ResultsFour major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020. ConclusionsThe multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.\nCountry wide surveillance reveals prevalent artemisinin partial resistance mutations with evidence for multiple origins and expansion of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations in northwest Tanzania\nAuthors: Juliano, J. J.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Simkin, A.; Fola, A. A.; Lyimo, B. M.; Perus, D.; Bakari, C.; Madebe, R. A.; Seth, M. D.; Mandara, C. I.; Popkin-Hall, Z. R.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Niare, K.; MacInnis, B.; Francis, F.; Mbwambo, D.; Garimo, I.; Chacky, F.; Aaron, S.; Lusasi, A.; Molteni, F.; Njau, R.; Lazaro, S.; Mohamed, A.; Bailey, J. A.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298207\nBackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526). InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.\nPublished benefits of ivermectin use in Itajai, Brazil for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality are entirely explained by statistical artefacts\nAuthors: Mills, R.; Pecanha Antonio, A. C.; Tucker-Kellogg, G.\nScore: 421.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924\nBackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020. MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect. ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship. ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.\nTuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: diagnostic challenges and determinants of outcome\nAuthors: Kurver, L.; Seers, T.; van Dorp, S.; van Crevel, R.; Pollara, G.; van Laarhoven, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298501\nBackgroundTuberculosis (TB) can induce secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome with high mortality. To improve insight into optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies, we integrated all published reports of adult HIV-negative TB-associated HLH (TB-HLH) globally to define clinical characteristics and therapeutic approaches associated with improved survival. MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Global Index Medicus were searched for eligible records. TB-HLH cases were categorized into patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis receiving antituberculosis treatment while developing HLH, and patients presenting with HLH of unknown cause later diagnosed with TB. We integrated patients clinical characteristics, diagnostic test results, and pre-specified parameters associated with survival into a logistic regression model. ResultsWe identified 115 individually reported cases, 45 (39.1%) from low TB incidence countries (\u003c10/100.000 per year). Compared to HLH patients with known TB (n=21), patients with HLH of unknown cause (n=94), more often had extrapulmonary TB (88.3% vs. 66.7%), while the opposite was true for pulmonary disease (59.6% vs. 91.5%). Overall, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in the bone marrow in 78.4% of patients for whom examination was reported (n=74). Only 10.5% (4/38) of patients tested had a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay. In-hospital survival was 71.9% (69/96) in those treated for TB and 0% (18/18) in those who did not receive antituberculosis treatment (p \u003c 0.001). ConclusionsTuberculosis should be considered as a cause of unexplained HLH. TB-HLH is probably under-reported, and the diagnostic work-up of HLH patients should include bone marrow examination for evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Prompt initiation of antituberculosis treatment will likely improve survival. Key pointsHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an underreported complication of tuberculosis, often manifesting as extrapulmonary or miliary disease. TST and IGRA mostly show an anergic response. Threshold should be low bone marrow investigation for evidence of M. tuberculosis, and commencement of antituberculosis treatment.\nFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators of α1-acid glycoprotein fucosylation\nAuthors: Oltmanns, C.; Bremer, B.; Kusche, L.; Stal, P.; Zenlander, R.; Tauwaldt, J.; Ryden, I.; Pahlsson, P.; Cornberg, M.; Wedemeyer, H.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298443\nBackground and AimsThere is an urgent need for new high-quality markers in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [A]strom et al. suggested that S2-bound 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) might be a promising marker. Consequently, we evaluated S2-bound AGP for a predictive advantage in the early detection of HCC. MethodsIn a retrospective case-control study of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (n=93), we measured S2-bound AGP using the HepaCheC(R) ELISA kit (Glycobond AB, Linkoping, SE) at treatment start, end of treatment and follow-up (maximum: 78 months). Patients were retrospectively propensity score matched (1:2). 31 patients chronically infected with HCV developed HCC after sustained virological response while 62 did not. In addition, samples of HBV, MASLD and HCC from different etiologies patients were measured. ResultsS2-bound AGP elevation in HCC patients was confirmed. However, we did not observe a predictive advantage of S2-bound AGP in early detection of HCC during treatment and follow-up. Interestingly, S2-bound AGP levels correlated with aspartate aminotransferase ({rho}=0.56, p=9.5x10-15) and liver elastography ({rho}=0.67, p=2.2x10-16). Of note, S2-bound AGP decreased in patients chronically infected with HCV after treatment-induced clearance of HCV. ConclusionFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators in the fucosylation of AGP. The potential role of S2-bound AGP as a novel tumor marker requires further investigation.

E.; Keat, S. B. K.; Ladell, K.; Miners, K. L.; Jones, S. A.; Mellou, E.; Toonen, E. J. M.; Price, D. A.; Morgan, B. P.; Zelek, W. M.\nScore: 133.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597\nBackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID. MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID. FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID.

L.; Noble, E. K.; Sumner, K. M.; Joshi, D. J.; Tartof, S. Y.; Wernli, K. J.; Martin, E. T.; Gaglani, M.; Zimmerman, R.; Talbot, H. K.; Grijalva, C. G.; Belongia, E. A.; Carlson, C.; Coughlin, M.; Flannery, B. M.; Pearce, B.; Rogier, E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298700\nTo describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.\nImproving Individualized Treatment Decisions: A Bayesian Multivariate Hierarchical Model for Developing a Treatment Benefit Index using Mixed Types of Outcomes\nAuthors: Wu, D.; Goldfeld, K. S.; Petkova, E.; Park, H. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298711\nBackground: Precision medicine has led to the development of targeted treatment strategies tailored to individual patients based on their characteristics and disease manifestations. Although precision medicine often focuses on a single health outcome for individualized treatment decision rules (ITRs), relying only on a single outcome rather than all available outcomes information leads to suboptimal data usage when developing optimal ITRs. Methods: To address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model that leverages the wealth of correlated health outcomes collected in clinical trials. The approach jointly models mixed types of correlated outcomes, facilitating the \"borrowing of information\" across the multivariate outcomes, and results in a more accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects compared to using single regression models for each outcome. We develop a treatment benefit index, which quantifies the relative treatment benefit of the experimental treatment over the control treatment, based on the proposed multivariate outcome model. Results: We demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach through extensive simulations and an application to an international Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment trial. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the occurrence of erroneous treatment decisions compared to a single regression model for a single health outcome. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model across various study scenarios. Application of the method to the COVID-19 trial exhibits improvements in estimating the individual-level treatment efficacy (indicated by narrower credible intervals for odds ratios) and optimal ITRs. Conclusion: The study jointly models mixed types of outcomes in the context of developing ITRs. By considering multiple health outcomes, the proposed approach can advance the development of more effective and reliable personalized treatment\nApplication of the Fluctuation Test to the data of Morbidity and Mortality by COVID-19 in China 2020-2023\nAuthors: Lopez, A. Y.; Fernandez, M. A.; Grassi, H. C.; Andrades, E. J.; Andrades, J. E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.23298174\nIn this work the Luria and Delbruck Fluctuation Test was applied to the data of Morbidity and Mortality by COVID-19 in China from January 2020 to August 2023. Three types of data were used: es.statista.com, datosmacro.expansion.com and larepublica.co without modification, but trying to avoid and justify the anomalies and inconsistencies observed. The methods originally used to establish the interactions of two populations were evaluated: the viral population with that of its host and the drift of both organisms. Only the fluctuations of the weekly Variance of daily increase of Cases (Morbidity) and of the weekly Variance of daily increase of Deaths (Mortality) were studied. The results showed that the Fluctuation Test is applicable to the selected data from China and other data from India, Japan and South Korea, used as controls. The study was separated into two periods: a first initial period from January 2020 to September 2021 and a second final period from October 2021 to August 2023. Results were obtained for Morbidity and Mortality that relate the fluctuations of the first with the fluctuations of the second. However, it was possible to detect some anomalies and uncertainties that were possibly derived from inconsistencies in the original data. A repeated fluctuation was observed in the boreal winter in January, February and March of each one of the year studied. A clear decrease in fluctuation was detected in that period in 2021 that could be attributed to the strict confinement during the quarantine in China between 2020 and 2021. Massive, extensive and intensive vaccinations failed to completely eliminate the most important fluctuations. In this work we tried to correlate the appearance of some virus variants with the fluctuations. The most relevant results of said correlation are presented. With the results of this work, the animal origin cannot be confirmed nor can the human or laboratory origin of the SARS CoV-2 virus that caused the initial emerging infection, be ruled out. However, it was concluded that this method could be used to search for clues about its origin. One of these keys is the comparison of the result of the first important fluctuation in the boreal winter of 2020 in each of the countries studied as controls: India, Japan and South Korea. The comparison of this result with the first fluctuation of China for that same period could give clues about the origin of the virus.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Clinical data demonstrate an increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) following severe COVID-19 infection. This may be driven by a dysregulated immune response associated with severe disease. Monocytes and vascular tissue resident macrophages play a critical role in atherosclerosis, the main pathology leading to ischemic CVD. Natural killer (NK) cells are a heterogenous group of cells that are critical during viral pathogenesis and are known to be dysregulated during severe COVID-19 infection. Their role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently been described. However, the contribution of their altered phenotypes to atherogenesis following severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that during and after severe COVID-19, circulating proinflammatory monocytes and activated NK cells act synergistically to increase uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) into vascular tissue with subsequent foam cell generation leading to atherogenesis despite recovery from acute infection. Our data provide new insights, revealing the roles of monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells in COVID-19-related atherogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIncreased numbers of cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infections were diagnosed in migrant-related facilities of Europe since summer 2022. Most cases involved cutaneous diphtheria, although some respiratory cases and fatalities were reported. A pan-European consortium was created to assess the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of this outbreak.

MethodsAll 363 toxigenic C. diphtheriae infection cases from ten European countries were included. Data from case interviews regarding countries of origin and transit routes of migrants were collected. Bacterial isolates underwent whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phylogenetic relationships of outbreak isolates and their antimicrobial resistance genes were studied.

ResultsFour major genomic clusters were identified, revealing the multiclonal nature of the outbreak. Genes ermX, coding for erythromycin resistance, and genes pbp2m and blaOXA-2 for beta-lactam resistance, were detected in a subset of isolates. Isolates harboring ermX were resistant to erythromycin, and isolates carrying pbp2m were resistant to penicillin, but susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas those carrying blaOXA-2 remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Genomic variation within the four genomic clusters led to estimate their most recent common ancestors between 2017 and 2020.

ConclusionsThe multi-country distribution of each cluster demonstrated repeated cross-border spread. The increased number of C. diphtheriae cases among migrants is a cause for concern, particularly considering antimicrobial resistance phenotypes that threaten the efficacy of first-line treatments. This work provides important knowledge on modern C. diphtheriae infections, useful for addressing the reemergence of diphtheria in vulnerable populations and to guide clinical management and measures to control further dissemination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high.

MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform.

FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526).

InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020.

MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect.

ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship.

ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) can induce secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome with high mortality. To improve insight into optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies, we integrated all published reports of adult HIV-negative TB-associated HLH (TB-HLH) globally to define clinical characteristics and therapeutic approaches associated with improved survival.

MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Global Index Medicus were searched for eligible records. TB-HLH cases were categorized into patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis receiving antituberculosis treatment while developing HLH, and patients presenting with HLH of unknown cause later diagnosed with TB. We integrated patients clinical characteristics, diagnostic test results, and pre-specified parameters associated with survival into a logistic regression model.

ResultsWe identified 115 individually reported cases, 45 (39.1%) from low TB incidence countries (&lt;10/100.000 per year). Compared to HLH patients with known TB (n=21), patients with HLH of unknown cause (n=94), more often had extrapulmonary TB (88.3% vs. 66.7%), while the opposite was true for pulmonary disease (59.6% vs. 91.5%). Overall, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in the bone marrow in 78.4% of patients for whom examination was reported (n=74). Only 10.5% (4/38) of patients tested had a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay. In-hospital survival was 71.9% (69/96) in those treated for TB and 0% (18/18) in those who did not receive antituberculosis treatment (p &lt; 0.001).

ConclusionsTuberculosis should be considered as a cause of unexplained HLH. TB-HLH is probably under-reported, and the diagnostic work-up of HLH patients should include bone marrow examination for evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Prompt initiation of antituberculosis treatment will likely improve survival.

Key pointsHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an underreported complication of tuberculosis, often manifesting as extrapulmonary or miliary disease. TST and IGRA mostly show an anergic response. Threshold should be low bone marrow investigation for evidence of M. tuberculosis, and commencement of antituberculosis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsThere is an urgent need for new high-quality markers in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [A]strom et al. suggested that S2-bound 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) might be a promising marker. Consequently, we evaluated S2-bound AGP for a predictive advantage in the early detection of HCC.

MethodsIn a retrospective case-control study of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (n=93), we measured S2-bound AGP using the HepaCheC(R) ELISA kit (Glycobond AB, Linkoping, SE) at treatment start, end of treatment and follow-up (maximum: 78 months). Patients were retrospectively propensity score matched (1:2). 31 patients chronically infected with HCV developed HCC after sustained virological response while 62 did not. In addition, samples of HBV, MASLD and HCC from different etiologies patients were measured.

ResultsS2-bound AGP elevation in HCC patients was confirmed. However, we did not observe a predictive advantage of S2-bound AGP in early detection of HCC during treatment and follow-up. Interestingly, S2-bound AGP levels correlated with aspartate aminotransferase ({rho}=0.56, p=9.5x10-15) and liver elastography ({rho}=0.67, p=2.2x10-16). Of note, S2-bound AGP decreased in patients chronically infected with HCV after treatment-induced clearance of HCV.

ConclusionFibrosis and liver inflammation are key regulators in the fucosylation of AGP. The potential role of S2-bound AGP as a novel tumor marker requires further investigation.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID.

MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID.

FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID.

        <p class="abstract">To describe humoral immune responses to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed immunoglobulin G binding antibody levels using a commercial multiplex bead assay against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We measured binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL) during acute illness within 5 days of illness onset and during convalescence in 105 ambulatory patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron variant viruses. Comparing acute- to convalescent phase antibody concentrations, geometric mean anti-N antibody concentrations increased 47-fold from 5.5 to 259 BAU/mL. Anti-RBD antibody concentrations increased 2.5-fold from 1258 to 3189 BAU/mL.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Precision medicine has led to the development of targeted treatment strategies tailored to individual patients based on their characteristics and disease manifestations. Although precision medicine often focuses on a single health outcome for individualized treatment decision rules (ITRs), relying only on a single outcome rather than all available outcomes information leads to suboptimal data usage when developing optimal ITRs. Methods: To address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model that leverages the wealth of correlated health outcomes collected in clinical trials. The approach jointly models mixed types of correlated outcomes, facilitating the &#34;borrowing of information&#34; across the multivariate outcomes, and results in a more accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects compared to using single regression models for each outcome. We develop a treatment benefit index, which quantifies the relative treatment benefit of the experimental treatment over the control treatment, based on the proposed multivariate outcome model. Results: We demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach through extensive simulations and an application to an international Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment trial. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the occurrence of erroneous treatment decisions compared to a single regression model for a single health outcome. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model across various study scenarios. Application of the method to the COVID-19 trial exhibits improvements in estimating the individual-level treatment efficacy (indicated by narrower credible intervals for odds ratios) and optimal ITRs. Conclusion: The study jointly models mixed types of outcomes in the context of developing ITRs. By considering multiple health outcomes, the proposed approach can advance the development of more effective and reliable personalized treatment</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this work the Luria and Delbruck Fluctuation Test was applied to the data of Morbidity and Mortality by COVID-19 in China from January 2020 to August 2023. Three types of data were used: es.statista.com, datosmacro.expansion.com and larepublica.co without modification, but trying to avoid and justify the anomalies and inconsistencies observed. The methods originally used to establish the interactions of two populations were evaluated: the viral population with that of its host and the drift of both organisms. Only the fluctuations of the weekly Variance of daily increase of Cases (Morbidity) and of the weekly Variance of daily increase of Deaths (Mortality) were studied. The results showed that the Fluctuation Test is applicable to the selected data from China and other data from India, Japan and South Korea, used as controls. The study was separated into two periods: a first initial period from January 2020 to September 2021 and a second final period from October 2021 to August 2023. Results were obtained for Morbidity and Mortality that relate the fluctuations of the first with the fluctuations of the second. However, it was possible to detect some anomalies and uncertainties that were possibly derived from inconsistencies in the original data. A repeated fluctuation was observed in the boreal winter in January, February and March of each one of the year studied. A clear decrease in fluctuation was detected in that period in 2021 that could be attributed to the strict confinement during the quarantine in China between 2020 and 2021. Massive, extensive and intensive vaccinations failed to completely eliminate the most important fluctuations. In this work we tried to correlate the appearance of some virus variants with the fluctuations. The most relevant results of said correlation are presented. With the results of this work, the animal origin cannot be confirmed nor can the human or laboratory origin of the SARS CoV-2 virus that caused the initial emerging infection, be ruled out. However, it was concluded that this method could be used to search for clues about its origin. One of these keys is the comparison of the result of the first important fluctuation in the boreal winter of 2020 in each of the countries studied as controls: India, Japan and South Korea. The comparison of this result with the first fluctuation of China for that same period could give clues about the origin of the virus.</p>
