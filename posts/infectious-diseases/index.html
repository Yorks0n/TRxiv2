A.; Lu, S.; Dalhuisen, T.; Borberg, E.; Senussi, Y.; Luna, M. A.; Chang Song, C.; Clark, A.; Zamora, A.; Lew, M.; Viswanathan, B.; Huang, B.; Anglin, K.; Hoh, R.; Hsue, P. Y.; Durstenfeld, M. S.; Spinelli, M. A.; Glidden, D. V.; Henrich, T. J.; Kelly, J. D.; Deeks, S. G.; Walt, D. R.; Martin, J. N.\nScore: 209.9, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23297114\nBACKGROUND: Although RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are generally thought to be transient, the persistence of viral components beyond the acute phase can be driven by a variety of virologic and immunologic factors. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 antigens may persist following COVID-19 but were limited by a lack of comparison to a large number of true negative control samples. METHODS: Using single molecule array (Simoa) assays for SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigen in plasma from 171 pandemic-era individuals in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 250 pre-pandemic control samples, we compared prevalence of antigen detection. We used logistic regression models and prevalence ratios (PRs) to assess the relationship between demographic and disease factors and antigen persistence. RESULTS: Compared to the proportion of antigen positivity in the pre-pandemic controls (2%), detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was more frequent across all post-acute COVID-19 time bins (3-6 months: 12.6%, p\u003c0.001; 6-10 months, 10.7%, p=0.0002; 10-14 months, 7.5%, p=0.017). These differences were driven by spike protein for up to 14 months and nucleocapsid in the first 6 months after infection. The co-occurrence of multiple antigens at a single timepoint was uncommon. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 (versus not hospitalized) and worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 among those not hospitalized (versus more benign illness) were associated with higher prevalence of post-acute antigen detection (PR 1.86, p=0.03; PR 3.5, p=0.07, respectively) in the pandemic era. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 antigens can persist beyond the period of acute illness. The observation that more than 10% of plasma samples for over a year following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection contain detectable viral antigen, which are potentially immunogenic, has significant implications given the sheer number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 to date. More work will be needed to determine whether these antigens have a causal role in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).\nIs Recovery Just the Beginning? Persistent Symptoms and Health and Performance Deterioration in Post-COVID-19, non-hospitalised University Students - A Cross-Sectional Study\nAuthors: Latifi, A.; Flegr, J.\nScore: 109.0, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297203\nMany individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from COVID-19. Current data are limited on the long-term trajectory of these symptoms and their prevalence in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first two years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the two-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.\nPostacute Sequelae SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Vaccination Status: A Six-Month Latent Class Analysis\nAuthors: Sun, X.; DeShazo, J. P.; Anatale-Tardiff, L.; Di Fusco, M.; Allen, K. E.; Porter, T. M.; Coetzer, H.; Lopez, S. M. C.; Puzniak, L.; Cappelleri, J. C.\nScore: 52.4, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297332\nSymptoms post-SARS-CoV-2 infection may persist for months and cause significant impairment and impact to quality of life. Acute symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are well studied, yet data on clusters of symptoms over time, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), are limited. We aim to characterize PASC phenotypes by identifying symptom clusters over a six-month period following infection in individuals vaccinated (boosted and not) and those unvaccinated. Subjects with [\u0026ge;]1 self-reported symptom and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at CVS Health US test sites were recruited between January and April 2022. Patient-reported outcomes symptoms, heath-related quality of life (QoL), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) were captured at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-acute infection. Logistic regression and latent class analysis (LCA) were performed on 20 symptoms using baseline socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and vaccination status as well as EQ-5and WPAI results as covariables. Subjects with more symptoms were associated with lower health-related quality of life, and worse WPAI scores. LCA identified three phenotypes that are primarily differentiated by number of symptoms. These three phenotypes remained consistent across time periods. Vaccinated individuals were more likely to be in the low symptom burden latent classes at all time points compared to unvaccinated individuals.\nProjections of the incidence of COVID-19 in Japan and the potential impact of a Fall 2023 COVID-19 Vaccine\nAuthors: Kohli, M.; Maschio, M.; Lee, A.; Igarashi, A.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23297475\nBackgroundThe study objective was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and deaths in Japan from September 2023 to August 2024 and potential impact of a Fall 2023 COVID-19 vaccine for adults [\u0026ge;]18 years on these outcomes. MethodsA previously developed Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model for the United States (US) was adapted to Japan. The numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations, and deaths were calculated. Given differences in vaccination coverage, masking practices and social mixing patterns between the US and Japan, all inputs were updated to reflect the Japanese context. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) values are hypothetical, but predicted based on existing VE values of bivalent BA.4/BA.5 boosters against BA.4/BA.5 in Japan, from the VERSUS test-negative case-control study. Sensitivity analyses were performed. ResultsThe base case model predicts overall that there will be approximately 35.2 million symptomatic COVID-19 infections, 690,000 hospitalizations, and 62,000 deaths in Japan between September 2023 and August 2024. If an updated COVID-19 vaccine is offered to all adults aged 18 years and older in Fall 2023, the model predicts that 7.3 million infections, 275,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths will be prevented. If vaccines are only given to those aged 65 years and older, only 2.9 million infections, 180,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 deaths will be prevented. Sensitivity analysis results suggest that hospitalizations and deaths prevented are most sensitive to initial vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalizations, and the waning rate associated with VE against infection. Symptomatic infections prevented was most sensitive to initial VE against infection and VE waning. ConclusionsResults suggest that a Fall 2023 COVID-19 vaccine would reduce total numbers of COVID-19 related infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nThe more symptoms the better? Covid-19 vaccine side effects and long-term neutralizing antibody response\nAuthors: Dutcher, E. G.; Epel, E. S.; Mason, A. E.; Hecht, F. M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 259.3, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nDynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a Large US population Over a Period of 12 Months\nAuthors: Karkanitsa, M.; Li, Y.; Valenti, S.; Spathies, J.; Kelly, S.; Yee, L.; Croker, J. A.; Wang, J.; Lucia Alfonso, A.; Faust, M.; Mehalko, J.; Drew, M.; Denson, J.-P.; Putman, Z.; Fathi, P.; Ngo, T. B.; Siripong, N.; Ann Baus, H.; Petersen, B.; Ford, E. W.; Sundaresan, V.; Sundaresan, V.; Josyula, A.; Han, A.; Giurgea, L. T.; Angela Rosas, L.; Bean, R.; Athota, R.; Czajkowski, L.; Klump-Thomas, C.; Cervantes-Medina, A.; Gouzoulis, M.; Reed, S.; Graubard, B.; Hall, M. D.; Kalish, H.; Esposito, D.; Kimberly, R. P.; Reis, S.; Sadtler, K.; Memoli, M. J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297329\nDue to a combination of asymptomatic or undiagnosed infections, the proportion of the United States population infected with SARS-CoV-2 was unclear from the beginning of the pandemic. We previously established a platform to screen for SARS-CoV-2 positivity across a representative proportion of the US population, from which we reported that almost 17 million Americans were estimated to have had undocumented infections in the Spring of 2020. Since then, vaccine rollout and prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants have further altered seropositivity trends within the United States population. To explore the longitudinal impacts of the pandemic and vaccine responses on seropositivity, we re-enrolled participants from our baseline study in a 6- and 12-month follow-up study to develop a longitudinal antibody profile capable of representing seropositivity within the United States during a critical period just prior to and during the initiation of vaccine rollout. Initial measurements showed that, since July 2020, seropositivity elevated within this population from 4.8% at baseline to 36.2% and 89.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We also evaluated nucleocapsid seropositivity and compared to spike seropositivity to identify trends in infection versus vaccination relative to baseline. These data serve as a window into a critical timeframe within the COVID-19 pandemic response and serve as a resource that could be used in subsequent respiratory illness outbreaks.\nStabilizing the return to normal behavior in an epidemic\nAuthors: Berry, T.; Ferrari, M.; Sauer, T.; Greybush, S. J.; Ebeigbe, D.; Whalen, A. J.; Schiff, S. J.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.23287222\nPredicting the interplay between infectious disease and behavior has been an intractable problem because behavioral response is so varied. We introduce a general framework for feedback between incidence and behavior for an infectious disease. By identifying stable equilibria, we provide policy end-states that are self-managing and self-maintaining. We prove mathematically the existence of two new endemic equilibria depending on the vaccination rate: one in the presence of low vaccination but with reduced societal activity (the \"new normal\"), and one with return to normal activity but with vaccination rate below that required for disease elimination. This framework allows us to anticipate the long-term consequence of an emerging disease and design a vaccination response that optimizes public health and limits societal consequences. Significance StatementThe experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that behavior can change dramatically in response to the spread of a disease. This behavioral response impacts disease transmission. Predicting future outcomes requires accounting for the feedback between behavior and transmission. We show that accounting for these feedbacks generates long-term predictions about disease burden and behavior that can guide policy.\nViral and host factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity in Georgia, USA\nAuthors: Carmola, L. R.; Roebling, A. D.; Khosravi, D.; Langsjoen, R. M.; Bombin, A.; Bixler, B.; Reid, A.; Chen, C.; Wang, E.; Lu, Y.; Zheng, Z.; Zhang, R.; Nguyen, P.-V.; Arthur, R. A.; Fitts, E.; Gulick, D. A.; Higginbotham, D.; Taz, A.; Ahmed, A.; Crumpler, J. H.; Kraft, C.; Lam, W. A.; Babiker, A.; Waggoner, J. J.; Openo, K. P.; Johnson, L. M.; Westbrook, A.; Piantadosi, A.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297530\nWhile SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown strong efficacy, their suboptimal uptake combined with the continued emergence of new viral variants raises concerns about the ongoing and future public health impact of COVID-19. We investigated viral and host factors, including vaccination status, that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity in a setting with low vaccination rates. We analyzed clinical and demographic data from 1,957 individuals in the state of Georgia, USA, coupled with viral genome sequencing from 1,185 samples. We found no difference in disease severity between individuals infected with Delta and Omicron variants among the participants in this study, after controlling for other factors, and we found no specific mutations associated with disease severity. Compared to those who were unvaccinated, vaccinated individuals experienced less severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, and the effect was similar for both variants. Vaccination within 270 days before infection was associated with decreased odds of moderate and severe outcomes, with the strongest association observed at 91-270 days post-vaccination. Older age and underlying health conditions, especially immunosuppression and renal disease, were associated with increased disease severity. Overall, this study provides insights into the impact of vaccination status, variants/mutations, and clinical factors on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection when vaccination rates are low. Understanding these associations will help refine and reinforce messaging around the crucial importance of vaccination in mitigating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease.\nAll-cause and infection-attributable mortality amongst adults with bloodstream infection, a population-based study\nAuthors: Underwood, J.; Griffths, R.; Gillespie, D.; Akbari, A.; Ahmed, H.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296346\nBackgroundBloodstream infections (BSI), are common, life threatening infections. However, it remains unclear whether deaths following BSI are primarily due to uncontrolled infection or underlying comorbidities. We aimed to determine the overall mortality, infection-attributable mortality, and causes of death for four leading BSI pathogens. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted within the SAIL Databank, containing anonymised population-scale electronic health record data for Wales, UK. We included adults with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus BSI between 2010-2022 using linked data from Public Health Wales and the Office for National Statistics. 30-day all-cause and sepsis-specific mortality, as a proxy for infection-attributable mortality, were compared using Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression respectively. FindingsWe identified 35,691 adults with BSI. E. coli was the most prevalent (59.6%). Adjusted analyses revealed that all organisms had a higher 30-day mortality vs. E. coli with MRSA the highest (HR: 2.04 [1.83-2.37], p\u003c0.001). Cancer was the leading cause of death following BSI for all organisms, particularly deaths occurring between 30-90 days (35.9%). 25.5% of deaths within 30 days involved sepsis. MRSA was associated with the highest sepsis mortality vs. E. coli (HR: 2.45 [2.12-2.82], p\u003c0.001). Peak CRP was positively associated with increased sepsis mortality (p\u003c0.001). InterpretationThis population-level study challenges the assumption that most deaths following BSI are directly attributable to uncontrolled infection. Our findings underscore the need for re-evaluating clinical trial design and developing better preventative strategies for BSI.

M.; Lin, T.-Y.; Fajardo, K. T.; Yolda-Carr, D.; Hislop, M.; Zuniga, D.; Platt, W.; Tuhoy, B.; Wang, J.; Wyllie, A. L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296240\nIntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens. MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at +4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([\u0026ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction. ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Although RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are generally thought to be transient, the persistence of viral components beyond the acute phase can be driven by a variety of virologic and immunologic factors. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 antigens may persist following COVID-19 but were limited by a lack of comparison to a large number of true negative control samples. METHODS: Using single molecule array (Simoa) assays for SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigen in plasma from 171 pandemic-era individuals in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 250 pre-pandemic control samples, we compared prevalence of antigen detection. We used logistic regression models and prevalence ratios (PRs) to assess the relationship between demographic and disease factors and antigen persistence. RESULTS: Compared to the proportion of antigen positivity in the pre-pandemic controls (2%), detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was more frequent across all post-acute COVID-19 time bins (3-6 months: 12.6%, p&lt;0.001; 6-10 months, 10.7%, p=0.0002; 10-14 months, 7.5%, p=0.017). These differences were driven by spike protein for up to 14 months and nucleocapsid in the first 6 months after infection. The co-occurrence of multiple antigens at a single timepoint was uncommon. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 (versus not hospitalized) and worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 among those not hospitalized (versus more benign illness) were associated with higher prevalence of post-acute antigen detection (PR 1.86, p=0.03; PR 3.5, p=0.07, respectively) in the pandemic era. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 antigens can persist beyond the period of acute illness. The observation that more than 10% of plasma samples for over a year following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection contain detectable viral antigen, which are potentially immunogenic, has significant implications given the sheer number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 to date. More work will be needed to determine whether these antigens have a causal role in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from COVID-19. Current data are limited on the long-term trajectory of these symptoms and their prevalence in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first two years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the two-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Symptoms post-SARS-CoV-2 infection may persist for months and cause significant impairment and impact to quality of life. Acute symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are well studied, yet data on clusters of symptoms over time, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), are limited. We aim to characterize PASC phenotypes by identifying symptom clusters over a six-month period following infection in individuals vaccinated (boosted and not) and those unvaccinated.

Subjects with [&amp;ge;]1 self-reported symptom and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at CVS Health US test sites were recruited between January and April 2022. Patient-reported outcomes symptoms, heath-related quality of life (QoL), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) were captured at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-acute infection.

Logistic regression and latent class analysis (LCA) were performed on 20 symptoms using baseline socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and vaccination status as well as EQ-5and WPAI results as covariables. Subjects with more symptoms were associated with lower health-related quality of life, and worse WPAI scores.

LCA identified three phenotypes that are primarily differentiated by number of symptoms. These three phenotypes remained consistent across time periods. Vaccinated individuals were more likely to be in the low symptom burden latent classes at all time points compared to unvaccinated individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe study objective was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and deaths in Japan from September 2023 to August 2024 and potential impact of a Fall 2023 COVID-19 vaccine for adults [&amp;ge;]18 years on these outcomes.

MethodsA previously developed Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model for the United States (US) was adapted to Japan. The numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations, and deaths were calculated. Given differences in vaccination coverage, masking practices and social mixing patterns between the US and Japan, all inputs were updated to reflect the Japanese context. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) values are hypothetical, but predicted based on existing VE values of bivalent BA.4/BA.5 boosters against BA.4/BA.5 in Japan, from the VERSUS test-negative case-control study. Sensitivity analyses were performed.

ResultsThe base case model predicts overall that there will be approximately 35.2 million symptomatic COVID-19 infections, 690,000 hospitalizations, and 62,000 deaths in Japan between September 2023 and August 2024. If an updated COVID-19 vaccine is offered to all adults aged 18 years and older in Fall 2023, the model predicts that 7.3 million infections, 275,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths will be prevented. If vaccines are only given to those aged 65 years and older, only 2.9 million infections, 180,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 deaths will be prevented. Sensitivity analysis results suggest that hospitalizations and deaths prevented are most sensitive to initial vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalizations, and the waning rate associated with VE against infection. Symptomatic infections prevented was most sensitive to initial VE against infection and VE waning.

ConclusionsResults suggest that a Fall 2023 COVID-19 vaccine would reduce total numbers of COVID-19 related infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to a combination of asymptomatic or undiagnosed infections, the proportion of the United States population infected with SARS-CoV-2 was unclear from the beginning of the pandemic. We previously established a platform to screen for SARS-CoV-2 positivity across a representative proportion of the US population, from which we reported that almost 17 million Americans were estimated to have had undocumented infections in the Spring of 2020. Since then, vaccine rollout and prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants have further altered seropositivity trends within the United States population. To explore the longitudinal impacts of the pandemic and vaccine responses on seropositivity, we re-enrolled participants from our baseline study in a 6- and 12-month follow-up study to develop a longitudinal antibody profile capable of representing seropositivity within the United States during a critical period just prior to and during the initiation of vaccine rollout. Initial measurements showed that, since July 2020, seropositivity elevated within this population from 4.8% at baseline to 36.2% and 89.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We also evaluated nucleocapsid seropositivity and compared to spike seropositivity to identify trends in infection versus vaccination relative to baseline. These data serve as a window into a critical timeframe within the COVID-19 pandemic response and serve as a resource that could be used in subsequent respiratory illness outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predicting the interplay between infectious disease and behavior has been an intractable problem because behavioral response is so varied. We introduce a general framework for feedback between incidence and behavior for an infectious disease. By identifying stable equilibria, we provide policy end-states that are self-managing and self-maintaining. We prove mathematically the existence of two new endemic equilibria depending on the vaccination rate: one in the presence of low vaccination but with reduced societal activity (the &#34;new normal&#34;), and one with return to normal activity but with vaccination rate below that required for disease elimination. This framework allows us to anticipate the long-term consequence of an emerging disease and design a vaccination response that optimizes public health and limits societal consequences.

Significance StatementThe experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that behavior can change dramatically in response to the spread of a disease. This behavioral response impacts disease transmission. Predicting future outcomes requires accounting for the feedback between behavior and transmission. We show that accounting for these feedbacks generates long-term predictions about disease burden and behavior that can guide policy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown strong efficacy, their suboptimal uptake combined with the continued emergence of new viral variants raises concerns about the ongoing and future public health impact of COVID-19. We investigated viral and host factors, including vaccination status, that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity in a setting with low vaccination rates. We analyzed clinical and demographic data from 1,957 individuals in the state of Georgia, USA, coupled with viral genome sequencing from 1,185 samples. We found no difference in disease severity between individuals infected with Delta and Omicron variants among the participants in this study, after controlling for other factors, and we found no specific mutations associated with disease severity. Compared to those who were unvaccinated, vaccinated individuals experienced less severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, and the effect was similar for both variants. Vaccination within 270 days before infection was associated with decreased odds of moderate and severe outcomes, with the strongest association observed at 91-270 days post-vaccination. Older age and underlying health conditions, especially immunosuppression and renal disease, were associated with increased disease severity. Overall, this study provides insights into the impact of vaccination status, variants/mutations, and clinical factors on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection when vaccination rates are low. Understanding these associations will help refine and reinforce messaging around the crucial importance of vaccination in mitigating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSI), are common, life threatening infections. However, it remains unclear whether deaths following BSI are primarily due to uncontrolled infection or underlying comorbidities. We aimed to determine the overall mortality, infection-attributable mortality, and causes of death for four leading BSI pathogens.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted within the SAIL Databank, containing anonymised population-scale electronic health record data for Wales, UK. We included adults with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus BSI between 2010-2022 using linked data from Public Health Wales and the Office for National Statistics. 30-day all-cause and sepsis-specific mortality, as a proxy for infection-attributable mortality, were compared using Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression respectively.

FindingsWe identified 35,691 adults with BSI. E. coli was the most prevalent (59.6%). Adjusted analyses revealed that all organisms had a higher 30-day mortality vs. E. coli with MRSA the highest (HR: 2.04 [1.83-2.37], p&lt;0.001).

Cancer was the leading cause of death following BSI for all organisms, particularly deaths occurring between 30-90 days (35.9%). 25.5% of deaths within 30 days involved sepsis. MRSA was associated with the highest sepsis mortality vs. E. coli (HR: 2.45 [2.12-2.82], p&lt;0.001). Peak CRP was positively associated with increased sepsis mortality (p&lt;0.001).

InterpretationThis population-level study challenges the assumption that most deaths following BSI are directly attributable to uncontrolled infection. Our findings underscore the need for re-evaluating clinical trial design and developing better preventative strategies for BSI.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEfforts to diagnose and monitor transmissible respiratory infections can be impaired by invasive or resource-intensive sample collection. Having extensively demonstrated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we sought to validate its potential for other common upper respiratory tract pathogens.

MethodsWe modified our RNA-extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for multiplexed detection of influenza A/B (IAV/IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Stability of virus detection in saliva from virus-positive patients was tested after storage at &#43;4{degrees}C, room temperature ([~]19{degrees}C), 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C for up to 7 days and through simulated shipping conditions. De-identified saliva samples were collected from individuals ([&amp;ge;]18 years) with respiratory symptoms who were undergoing nasal-swab-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 (New Haven, CT). Saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were tested with the multiplexed assay, with and without RNA extraction.

ResultsThe limit of assay detection ranged from 3-6 copies/l, virus target depending. Detection remained stable after prolonged sample storage at elevated temperatures and through shipping conditions. From the symptomatic testing sites, 1,095 clinical specimens tested SARS-CoV-2-negative. Upon multiplexed testing of their paired saliva, 41 (3.7%) tested positive (IAV, n=20; RSV, n=5; hMPV, n=7). Additionally, upon screening samples in singleplex for pneumococcus, 29 (3%) samples tested positive.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the adaptability of a low-cost, open-source saliva-based PCR test for common respiratory pathogens, beyond SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated its utility in symptomatic individuals, identifying viral infection missed when testing focused solely on a singular target, such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>
