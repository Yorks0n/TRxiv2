M.; Robinson, J. E.; Drury, S. S.; Prather, A. A.\nScore: 272.0, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296186\nProtection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.\nCountry wide surveillance reveals prevalent artemisinin partial resistance mutations with evidence for multiple origins and expansion of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations in northwest Tanzania\nAuthors: Juliano, J. J.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Simkin, A.; Fola, A. A.; Lyimo, B. M.; Perus, D.; Bakari, C.; Madebe, R. A.; Seth, M. D.; Mandara, C. I.; Popkin-Hall, Z. R.; Moshi, R.; Mbwambo, R. B.; Niare, K.; MacInnis, B.; Francis, F.; Mbwambo, D.; Garimo, I.; Chacky, F.; Aaron, S.; Lusasi, A.; Molteni, F.; Njau, R.; Lazaro, S.; Mohamed, A.; Bailey, J. A.; Ishengoma, D. S.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298207\nBackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526). InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.\nHigh prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent Plasmodium falciparum infections in Urban Bouake, Cote dIvoire, but no hrp2 deletions: Implications for Malaria Control\nAuthors: SAGNA, A. B.; Gebre, Y.; Vera-Arias, C. A.; Traore, D. F.; Tchekoi, B. N.; Assi, S. B.; Koffi, A. A.; Rogier, C.; Remoue, F.; Koepfli, C.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298263\nAsymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic settings, yet diagnosing these infections remains challenging because they are often below the limit of detection of conventional light microscopy (LM) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Deletions of the hrp2/3 gene, encoding the protein detected by the most sensitive class of RDTs, present a further threat. In this study, the prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent P. falciparum infections was characterized in the rainy season in the city of Bouake, Central Cote dIvoire. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine neighborhoods of Bouake, Cote dIvoire, in 2016. Matched LM, RDTs, and varATS qPCR, were used to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections and to compare the performance of the different diagnostic methods. P. falciparum hrp2/3 deletions were typed by digital PCR. Among 2313 individuals, malaria prevalence was 10.8% by microscopy, 13.0% by RDT, 35.1% by qPCR, and 37.3% (863/2313) when all three methods were combined. 96.4% (832/863) of individuals with P. falciparum infections did not report a recent fever. 57.1% (493/863) of infections were sub-patent. The prevalence was highly heterogeneous across the neighborhoods, ranging from 15% to 55.2%, and differed among age groups (\u003c5 years: 17.7%, 5-14 years: 42.7%, [\u0026ge;]15 years: 35.9%). Compared to varATS qPCR, LM and RDT had a low sensitivity of 24.3% and 34.2%, respectively, although both methods were highly specific (\u003e96%). Sub-microscopic malaria infections were more prevalent in [\u0026ge;]15-year-olds (69.9%, 349/499) and in the neighborhood of Dar es Salam (75.9%, 44/58). No hrp2 deletions were observed, and two samples carried hrp3 deletion/wild-type mixed infections. The high prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections prompts the implementation of strategies targeting these parasite reservoirs to achieve reductions in malaria burden in this high-transmission city of Cote dIvoire.\nPublished benefits of ivermectin use in Itajai, Brazil for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality are entirely explained by statistical artefacts\nAuthors: Mills, R.; Pecanha Antonio, A. C.; Tucker-Kellogg, G.\nScore: 422.8, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924\nBackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020. MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect. ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship. ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.\nComplement dysregulation is a predictive and therapeutically amenable feature of long COVID\nAuthors: Baillie, K.; Davies, H. E.; Keat, S. B. K.; Ladell, K.; Miners, K. L.; Jones, S. A.; Mellou, E.; Toonen, E. J. M.; Price, D. A.; Morgan, B. P.; Zelek, W. M.\nScore: 131.4, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297597\nBackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID. MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID. FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID. FundingThis work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (COV-LT2-0041), the PolyBio Research Foundation, and the UK Dementia Research Institute.\nReal-world comparative effectiveness of a third dose of mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 among adults aged \u003e=65 years in the United States\nAuthors: Kirk, B.; Bush, C.; Toyip, A.; Mues, K. E.; Beck, E.; Li, L.; St. Laurent, S.; Georgieva, M.; Marks, M. A.; Sun, T.; Esposito, D. B.; Martin, D.; Van de Velde, N.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298054\nIntroductionTo compare the real-world effectiveness of a third dose of mRNA-1273 versus a third dose of BNT162b2 against breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults age [\u0026ge;]65 years who completed a primary series of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (regardless of which primary series was received). Materials and methodsThis observational comparative vaccine effectiveness (VE) study was conducted using administrative claims data from the US HealthVerity database (September 22, 2021, to August 31, 2022). A third dose of mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 was assessed for preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and medically attended COVID-19 among adults [\u0026ge;]65 years. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline characteristics between vaccine groups. Incidence rates from patient-level data and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using weighted Cox proportional hazards models were calculated to estimate relative VE for each outcome. ResultsOverall, 94,587 and 92,377 individuals received a third dose of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, respectively. Among the weighted population, the median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-74), 53% were female, and 46% were commercially insured. COVID-19 hospitalization rates per 1000 person-years (PYs) were 5.61 (95% CI, 5.13-6.09) for mRNA-1273 and 7.06 (95% CI, 6.54-7.57) for BNT162b2 (HR, 0.82; 0.69-0.98). Medically attended COVID-19 rates per 1000 PYs (95% CI) were 95.05 (95% CI, 93.03-97.06) for mRNA-1273 and 106.55 (95% CI, 104.53-108.57) for BNT162b2 (HR, 0.93; 0.89-0.98). ConclusionsResults from this observational comparative VE database study provide evidence that among older adults, a third dose of mRNA-1273 was more effective in preventing breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalization and medically attended COVID-19 infection compared with a third dose of BNT162b2.\nPost-pandemic memory T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is durable, broadly targeted and cross-reactive to hypermutated BA.2.86\nAuthors: Nesamari, R.; Omondi, M. A.; Hoft, M. A.; Ngomti, A.; Baguma, R.; Nkayi, A. A.; Besethi, A. S.; Magugu, S. F.; Mosala, P.; Walters, A.; Clark, G. M.; Mennen, M.; Skelem, S.; Adriaanse, M.; Grifoni, A.; Sette, A.; Keeton, R. S.; Ntusi, N. A.; Riou, C.; Burgers, W. A.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297714\nThe COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson \u0026 Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19. In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.\nPlasma-based antigen persistence in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Peluso, M. J.; Swank, Z. N.; Goldberg, S. A.; Lu, S.; Dalhuisen, T.; Borberg, E.; Senussi, Y.; Luna, M. A.; Chang Song, C.; Clark, A.; Zamora, A.; Lew, M.; Viswanathan, B.; Huang, B.; Anglin, K.; Hoh, R.; Hsue, P. Y.; Durstenfeld, M. S.; Spinelli, M. A.; Glidden, D. V.; Henrich, T. J.; Kelly, J. D.; Deeks, S. G.; Walt, D. R.; Martin, J. N.\nScore: 517.4, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23297114\nBACKGROUNDAlthough RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are generally thought to be transient, the persistence of viral components beyond the acute phase can be driven by a variety of virologic and immunologic factors. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 antigens may persist following COVID-19 but were limited by a lack of comparison to a large number of true negative control samples. METHODSUsing single molecule array (Simoa) assays for SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigen in plasma from 171 pandemic-era individuals in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 250 pre-pandemic control samples, we compared prevalence of antigen detection. We used logistic regression models and prevalence ratios (PRs) to assess the relationship between demographic and disease factors and antigen persistence. RESULTSCompared to the proportion of antigen positivity in the pre-pandemic controls (2%), detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was more frequent across all post-acute COVID-19 time bins (3-6 months: 12.6%, p\u003c0.001; 6-10 months, 10.7%, p=0.0002; 10-14 months, 7.5%, p=0.017). These differences were driven by spike protein for up to 14 months and nucleocapsid in the first 6 months after infection. The co-occurrence of multiple antigens at a single timepoint was uncommon. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 (versus not hospitalized) and worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 among those not hospitalized (versus more benign illness) were associated with higher prevalence of post-acute antigen detection (PR 1.86, p=0.03; PR 3.5, p=0.07, respectively) in the pandemic era. CONCLUSIONSOur findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 antigens can persist beyond the period of acute illness. The observation that more than 10% of plasma samples for over a year following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection contain detectable viral antigen, which are potentially immunogenic, has significant implications given the sheer number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 to date. More work will be needed to determine whether these antigens have a causal role in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).\nOne year health outcomes associated with systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Leavy, O.

We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. Methods Adults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. Findings In 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. Interpretation Systemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, and booster uptake has been low, in part because of concern about side effects. We examined the relationships between local and systemic symptoms, biometric changes, and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) after mRNA vaccination. Data were collected from adults (n = 364) who received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Serum nAB concentration was measured at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Daily symptom surveys were completed for six days starting on the day of each dose. Concurrently, objective biometric measurements, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, were collected. We found that certain symptoms (chills, tiredness, feeling unwell, and headache) after the second dose were associated with increases in nAB at 1 and 6 months post-vaccination, to roughly 140-160% the level of individuals without each symptom. Each additional symptom predicted a 1.1-fold nAB increase. Greater increases in skin temperature and heart rate after the second dose predicted higher nAB levels at both time points, but skin temperature change was more predictive of durable (6 month) nAB response than of short-term (1 month) nAB response. In the context of low ongoing vaccine uptake, our convergent symptom and biometric findings suggest that public health messaging could seek to reframe systemic symptoms after vaccination as desirable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high.

MethodsTo enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform.

FindingsGenotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr164L of 15% (80/526).

InterpretationThese findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic settings, yet diagnosing these infections remains challenging because they are often below the limit of detection of conventional light microscopy (LM) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Deletions of the hrp2/3 gene, encoding the protein detected by the most sensitive class of RDTs, present a further threat. In this study, the prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent P. falciparum infections was characterized in the rainy season in the city of Bouake, Central Cote dIvoire. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine neighborhoods of Bouake, Cote dIvoire, in 2016. Matched LM, RDTs, and varATS qPCR, were used to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections and to compare the performance of the different diagnostic methods. P. falciparum hrp2/3 deletions were typed by digital PCR. Among 2313 individuals, malaria prevalence was 10.8% by microscopy, 13.0% by RDT, 35.1% by qPCR, and 37.3% (863/2313) when all three methods were combined. 96.4% (832/863) of individuals with P. falciparum infections did not report a recent fever. 57.1% (493/863) of infections were sub-patent. The prevalence was highly heterogeneous across the neighborhoods, ranging from 15% to 55.2%, and differed among age groups (&lt;5 years: 17.7%, 5-14 years: 42.7%, [&amp;ge;]15 years: 35.9%). Compared to varATS qPCR, LM and RDT had a low sensitivity of 24.3% and 34.2%, respectively, although both methods were highly specific (&gt;96%). Sub-microscopic malaria infections were more prevalent in [&amp;ge;]15-year-olds (69.9%, 349/499) and in the neighborhood of Dar es Salam (75.9%, 44/58). No hrp2 deletions were observed, and two samples carried hrp3 deletion/wild-type mixed infections. The high prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections prompts the implementation of strategies targeting these parasite reservoirs to achieve reductions in malaria burden in this high-transmission city of Cote dIvoire.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTwo recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020.

MethodsStarting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, analysis of longitudinal data with cross-sectional design, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect.

ResultsUntreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship.

ConclusionsThe inference of ivermectin effect reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID encompasses a heterogeneous set of ongoing symptoms that affect many individuals after recovery from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The underlying biological mechanisms nonetheless remain obscure, precluding accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Complement dysregulation is a hallmark of acute COVID-19 but has not been investigated as a potential determinant of long COVID.

MethodsWe quantified a series of complement proteins, including markers of activation and regulation, in plasma samples from healthy convalescent individuals with a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and age/ethnicity/gender/infection/vaccine-matched patients with long COVID.

FindingsMarkers of classical (C1s-C1INH complex), alternative (Ba, iC3b), and terminal pathway (C5a, TCC) activation were significantly elevated in patients with long COVID. These markers in combination had a receiver operating characteristic predictive power of 0.794. Other complement proteins and regulators were also quantitatively different between healthy convalescent individuals and patients with long COVID. Generalized linear modeling further revealed that a clinically tractable combination of just four of these markers, namely the activation fragments iC3b, TCC, Ba, and C5a, had a predictive power of 0.785.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that complement biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis of long COVID and further suggest that currently available inhibitors of complement activation could be used to treat long COVID.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionTo compare the real-world effectiveness of a third dose of mRNA-1273 versus a third dose of BNT162b2 against breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults age [&amp;ge;]65 years who completed a primary series of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (regardless of which primary series was received).

Materials and methodsThis observational comparative vaccine effectiveness (VE) study was conducted using administrative claims data from the US HealthVerity database (September 22, 2021, to August 31, 2022). A third dose of mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 was assessed for preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and medically attended COVID-19 among adults [&amp;ge;]65 years. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline characteristics between vaccine groups. Incidence rates from patient-level data and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using weighted Cox proportional hazards models were calculated to estimate relative VE for each outcome.

ResultsOverall, 94,587 and 92,377 individuals received a third dose of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, respectively. Among the weighted population, the median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-74), 53% were female, and 46% were commercially insured. COVID-19 hospitalization rates per 1000 person-years (PYs) were 5.61 (95% CI, 5.13-6.09) for mRNA-1273 and 7.06 (95% CI, 6.54-7.57) for BNT162b2 (HR, 0.82; 0.69-0.98). Medically attended COVID-19 rates per 1000 PYs (95% CI) were 95.05 (95% CI, 93.03-97.06) for mRNA-1273 and 106.55 (95% CI, 104.53-108.57) for BNT162b2 (HR, 0.93; 0.89-0.98).

ConclusionsResults from this observational comparative VE database study provide evidence that among older adults, a third dose of mRNA-1273 was more effective in preventing breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalization and medically attended COVID-19 infection compared with a third dose of BNT162b2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

In BriefNesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDAlthough RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are generally thought to be transient, the persistence of viral components beyond the acute phase can be driven by a variety of virologic and immunologic factors. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 antigens may persist following COVID-19 but were limited by a lack of comparison to a large number of true negative control samples.

METHODSUsing single molecule array (Simoa) assays for SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigen in plasma from 171 pandemic-era individuals in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 250 pre-pandemic control samples, we compared prevalence of antigen detection. We used logistic regression models and prevalence ratios (PRs) to assess the relationship between demographic and disease factors and antigen persistence.

RESULTSCompared to the proportion of antigen positivity in the pre-pandemic controls (2%), detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was more frequent across all post-acute COVID-19 time bins (3-6 months: 12.6%, p&lt;0.001; 6-10 months, 10.7%, p=0.0002; 10-14 months, 7.5%, p=0.017). These differences were driven by spike protein for up to 14 months and nucleocapsid in the first 6 months after infection. The co-occurrence of multiple antigens at a single timepoint was uncommon. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 (versus not hospitalized) and worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 among those not hospitalized (versus more benign illness) were associated with higher prevalence of post-acute antigen detection (PR 1.86, p=0.03; PR 3.5, p=0.07, respectively) in the pandemic era.

CONCLUSIONSOur findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 antigens can persist beyond the period of acute illness. The observation that more than 10% of plasma samples for over a year following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection contain detectable viral antigen, which are potentially immunogenic, has significant implications given the sheer number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 to date. More work will be needed to determine whether these antigens have a causal role in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background In patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. Methods Adults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. Findings In 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. Interpretation Systemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.</p>
