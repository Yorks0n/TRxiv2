M.\nScore: 5163.1, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackgroundThe CDC recently defined being \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than in the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, not being \"up-to-date\" with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, \u003c0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"not up-to-date\" by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.\nInternal tremors and vibrations in long COVID: a cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Zhou, T.; McAlpine, L.; Michelsen, T.; Caraballo, C.; Sawano, M.; Bhattacharjee, B.; Lu, Y.; Iwasaki, A.; Krumholz, H.\nScore: 127.9, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291598\nBackgroundInternal tremors and vibrations symptoms have been described as part of neurologic disorders but have not been fully described as a part of long COVID. We compared demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, pre-pandemic comorbidities, and new-onset conditions between people with internal tremors and vibrations as part of their long COVID symptoms and people with long COVID but without these symptoms. MethodsA cross-sectional study, Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN), collected data from adults with long COVID. The study sample included 423 participants enrolled between May 2022 and June 2023. ResultsThe 423 participants had a median age of 46 years (interquartile range, 38-56), 74% were female, 87% were Non-Hispanic White, and 158 (37%) reported \"internal tremors, or buzzing/vibration\" as a long COVID symptom. Before long COVID, the groups had similar comorbidities. Post-COVID, participants with internal tremors and vibrations had significantly worse health as measured by the Euro-QoL visual analogue scale (median: 40 vs. 50 points, P = 0.007), higher rates of financial difficulties caused by the pandemic and housing insecurity (P \u003c 0.001 for each), and were significantly more likely to have new-onset conditions of mast cell disorders (11% vs. 2.6%), neurologic conditions (22% vs. 8.3%), anxiety (20% vs. 8.7%), and trauma- or stress-related mental health disorders (12% vs. 3.4%) compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni-adjusted P \u003c 0.05 for each). Participants with internal tremors also reported significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurologic long COVID symptoms compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni- adjusted P \u003c 0.05 for each). Conclusions and RelevanceAmong people with long COVID, those with internal tremors and vibrations have more associated symptoms and worse health status, suggesting it may be associated with a severe phenotype of the condition.\nMetformin reduces SARS-CoV-2 in a Phase 3 Randomized Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial\nAuthors: Bramante, C.

D.\nScore: 1202.3, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23290989\nCurrent antiviral treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not available globally, cannot be used with many medications, and are limited to virus-specific targets.1-3 Biophysical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 replication predicted that protein translation is an especially attractive target for antiviral therapy.4 Literature review identified metformin, widely known as a treatment for diabetes, as a potential suppressor of protein translation via targeting of the host mTor pathway.5 In vitro, metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.6,7 In the COVID-OUT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of COVID-19, metformin had a 42% reduction in ER visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days; a 58% reduction in hospitalizations/death through 28 days, and a 42% reduction in Long COVID through 10 months.8,9 Here we show viral load analysis of specimens collected in the COVID-OUT trial that the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95%CI, -1.05 to -0.06, p=0.027) while there was no virologic effect for ivermectin or fluvoxamine vs placebo. The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and with emerging data.10,11 Our results demonstrate, consistent with model predictions, that a safe, widely available,12 well-tolerated, and inexpensive oral medication, metformin, can be repurposed to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.\nViral clearance as a surrogate of clinical efficacy for COVID-19 therapies in outpatients: A systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Elias, K. M.; Khan, s. R.; Stadler, E.; Schlub, T. E.; Cromer, D.; Polizzotto, M. N.; Kent, S.; Turner, T.; Davenport, M. P.; Khoury, D. S.\nScore: 48.1, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.18.23291566\nBackgroundSurrogates of antiviral efficacy are needed for COVID-19. We investigated the relationship between the virological effect of treatment and clinical efficacy as measured by progression to severe disease in unvaccinated outpatients treated for mild to moderate COVID-19. MethodsWe searched PubMed, Scopus and medRxiv from inception to 27th September 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which tested potential treatments for COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients. We included studies that reported both clinical and virological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were the rate of disease progression (generally hospitalization or death within 28 days of commencing treatment) and virological outcomes were viral load (viral RNA copies in upper respiratory tract swabs) within the first 7 days of treatment. Studies were excluded if they did not report on the outcome of a primary randomised controlled trial, or if results were reported in a more complete form in another publication. Risk of Bias assessment was performed using the RoB 2.0 tool. We used generalised linear models with random effects to assess the association between outcomes and account for study heterogeneity. FindingsWe identified 1372 unique studies of which 14 (with a total of 9257 participants) met inclusion criteria. Larger virological treatment effects at both day 3 and day 5 were associated with decreased odds of progression to hospitalisation or death in unvaccinated ambulatory subjects. The odds ratio (OR) for each extra two-fold reduction in viral load in treated compared to control subjects was 0.54 on both days 3 and 5 post treatment (day 3 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74, day 5 95%CI 0.41 to 0.72). There was no relationship between the odds of hospitalisation or death and virological treatment effect at day 7 (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.74 to 1.13). InterpretationThis review provides evidence that treatment-induced acceleration of viral clearance within the first 5 days after treatment is a surrogate of clinical efficacy to prevent hospitalisation with COVID-19. Limitations included the aggregation of studies with differing designs, and evidence of risk of bias in some virological outcomes. These findings support the use of viral clearance as an early phase clinical trial endpoint of therapeutic efficacy.

A.; Cheemarla, N. R.; Hansel, K.; Green, A. B.; Amat, J. A. R.; Lozano, R.; Dudgeon, S. N.; Landry, M. L.; Schulz, W. L.; Foxman, E. F.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.23291498\nRecent work indicates that heightened nasal innate immunity in children may impact SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we identified drivers of nasal innate immune activation in children using cytokine profiling and multiplex pathogen detection in 291 pediatric nasopharyngeal samples from the 2022 Omicron surge. Nasal viruses and bacterial pathobionts were highly prevalent, especially in younger children (81% of symptomatic and 37% asymptomatic children overall; 91% and 62% in subjects \u003c5 yrs). For SARS-CoV-2, viral load was highest in young children, and viral load in single infections or combined viral loads in coinfections best predicted nasal CXCL10, a biomarker of the mucosal interferon response. Bacterial pathobionts correlated with high nasal IL-1{beta} and TNF, but not CXCL10, and viral-bacterial coinfections showed a combined immunophenotype. These findings reveal virus and bacteria as drivers of heightened nasal innate immunity in children and suggest that frequent host-pathogen interactions shape responses to respiratory viruses in this age group.\nRapid nanopore metagenomic sequencing and predictive susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures from intensive care patients with sepsis\nAuthors: Harris, P. N. A.; Bauer, M. J.; Lueftinger, L.; Beisken, S.; Forde, B. M.; Balch, R.; Cotta, M. O.; Schlapbach, L.; Raman, S.; Shekar, K.; Kruger, P.; Lipman, J.; Bialasiewicz, S.; Coin, L. J. M.; Roberts, J. A.; Paterson, D. L.; Irwin, A. D.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291261\nBackgroundDirect metagenomic sequencing from positive blood culture (BC) broths, to identify bacteria and predict antimicrobial susceptibility, has been previously demonstrated using Illumina-based methods, but is relatively slow. We aimed to evaluate this approach using nanopore sequencing to provide more rapid results. MethodsPatients with suspected sepsis in 4 intensive care units were prospectively enrolled. Human-depleted DNA was extracted from positive BC broths and sequenced using nanopore (MinION). Species abundance was estimated using Kraken2, and a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system (AREScloud) provided in silico antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) from assembled contigs. These results were compared to conventional identification and phenotypic AST. ResultsGenus-level agreement between conventional methods and metagenomic whole genome sequencing (MG-WGS) was 96.2% (50/52), but increased to 100% in monomicrobial infections. In total, 262 high quality AREScloud AST predictions across 24 samples were made, exhibiting categorical agreement (CA) of 89.3%, with major error (MA) and very major error (VME) rates of 10.5% and 12.1%, respectively. Over 90% CA was achieved for some taxa (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), but was suboptimal for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CA 50%). In 470 AST predictions across 42 samples, with both high quality and exploratory-only predictions, overall CA, ME and VME rates were 87.7%, 8.3% and 28.4%. VME rates were inflated by false susceptibility calls in a small number of species / antibiotic combinations with few representative resistant isolates. Time to reporting from MG-WGS could be achieved within 8-16 hours from blood culture positivity. ConclusionsDirect metagenomic sequencing from positive BC broths is feasible and can provide accurate predictive AST for some species and antibiotics, but is sub-optimal for a subset of common pathogens, with unacceptably high VME rates. Nanopore-based approaches may be faster but improvements in accuracy are required before it can be considered for clinical use. New developments in nanopore sequencing technology, and training of AI algorithms on larger and more diverse datasets may improve performance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CDC recently defined being &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included.

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#34;not up-to-date&#34; than in the &#34;up-to-date&#34; state. On multivariable analysis, not being &#34;up-to-date&#34; with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, &lt;0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#34;up-to-date&#34; after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine.

ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#34;not up-to-date&#34; by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.

SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34;. The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInternal tremors and vibrations symptoms have been described as part of neurologic disorders but have not been fully described as a part of long COVID. We compared demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, pre-pandemic comorbidities, and new-onset conditions between people with internal tremors and vibrations as part of their long COVID symptoms and people with long COVID but without these symptoms.

MethodsA cross-sectional study, Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN), collected data from adults with long COVID. The study sample included 423 participants enrolled between May 2022 and June 2023.

ResultsThe 423 participants had a median age of 46 years (interquartile range, 38-56), 74% were female, 87% were Non-Hispanic White, and 158 (37%) reported &#34;internal tremors, or buzzing/vibration&#34; as a long COVID symptom. Before long COVID, the groups had similar comorbidities. Post-COVID, participants with internal tremors and vibrations had significantly worse health as measured by the Euro-QoL visual analogue scale (median: 40 vs. 50 points, P = 0.007), higher rates of financial difficulties caused by the pandemic and housing insecurity (P &lt; 0.001 for each), and were significantly more likely to have new-onset conditions of mast cell disorders (11% vs. 2.6%), neurologic conditions (22% vs. 8.3%), anxiety (20% vs. 8.7%), and trauma- or stress-related mental health disorders (12% vs. 3.4%) compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni-adjusted P &lt; 0.05 for each). Participants with internal tremors also reported significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurologic long COVID symptoms compared with those without internal tremors (Bonferroni- adjusted P &lt; 0.05 for each).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong people with long COVID, those with internal tremors and vibrations have more associated symptoms and worse health status, suggesting it may be associated with a severe phenotype of the condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current antiviral treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not available globally, cannot be used with many medications, and are limited to virus-specific targets.1-3 Biophysical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 replication predicted that protein translation is an especially attractive target for antiviral therapy.4 Literature review identified metformin, widely known as a treatment for diabetes, as a potential suppressor of protein translation via targeting of the host mTor pathway.5 In vitro, metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.6,7 In the COVID-OUT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of COVID-19, metformin had a 42% reduction in ER visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days; a 58% reduction in hospitalizations/death through 28 days, and a 42% reduction in Long COVID through 10 months.8,9 Here we show viral load analysis of specimens collected in the COVID-OUT trial that the mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 95%CI, -1.05 to -0.06, p=0.027) while there was no virologic effect for ivermectin or fluvoxamine vs placebo. The metformin effect was consistent across subgroups and with emerging data.10,11 Our results demonstrate, consistent with model predictions, that a safe, widely available,12 well-tolerated, and inexpensive oral medication, metformin, can be repurposed to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSurrogates of antiviral efficacy are needed for COVID-19. We investigated the relationship between the virological effect of treatment and clinical efficacy as measured by progression to severe disease in unvaccinated outpatients treated for mild to moderate COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Scopus and medRxiv from inception to 27th September 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which tested potential treatments for COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients. We included studies that reported both clinical and virological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were the rate of disease progression (generally hospitalization or death within 28 days of commencing treatment) and virological outcomes were viral load (viral RNA copies in upper respiratory tract swabs) within the first 7 days of treatment. Studies were excluded if they did not report on the outcome of a primary randomised controlled trial, or if results were reported in a more complete form in another publication. Risk of Bias assessment was performed using the RoB 2.0 tool. We used generalised linear models with random effects to assess the association between outcomes and account for study heterogeneity.

FindingsWe identified 1372 unique studies of which 14 (with a total of 9257 participants) met inclusion criteria. Larger virological treatment effects at both day 3 and day 5 were associated with decreased odds of progression to hospitalisation or death in unvaccinated ambulatory subjects. The odds ratio (OR) for each extra two-fold reduction in viral load in treated compared to control subjects was 0.54 on both days 3 and 5 post treatment (day 3 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74, day 5 95%CI 0.41 to 0.72). There was no relationship between the odds of hospitalisation or death and virological treatment effect at day 7 (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.74 to 1.13).

InterpretationThis review provides evidence that treatment-induced acceleration of viral clearance within the first 5 days after treatment is a surrogate of clinical efficacy to prevent hospitalisation with COVID-19. Limitations included the aggregation of studies with differing designs, and evidence of risk of bias in some virological outcomes. These findings support the use of viral clearance as an early phase clinical trial endpoint of therapeutic efficacy.

        <p class="abstract">Recent work indicates that heightened nasal innate immunity in children may impact SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we identified drivers of nasal innate immune activation in children using cytokine profiling and multiplex pathogen detection in 291 pediatric nasopharyngeal samples from the 2022 Omicron surge. Nasal viruses and bacterial pathobionts were highly prevalent, especially in younger children (81% of symptomatic and 37% asymptomatic children overall; 91% and 62% in subjects &lt;5 yrs). For SARS-CoV-2, viral load was highest in young children, and viral load in single infections or combined viral loads in coinfections best predicted nasal CXCL10, a biomarker of the mucosal interferon response. Bacterial pathobionts correlated with high nasal IL-1{beta} and TNF, but not CXCL10, and viral-bacterial coinfections showed a combined immunophenotype. These findings reveal virus and bacteria as drivers of heightened nasal innate immunity in children and suggest that frequent host-pathogen interactions shape responses to respiratory viruses in this age group.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDirect metagenomic sequencing from positive blood culture (BC) broths, to identify bacteria and predict antimicrobial susceptibility, has been previously demonstrated using Illumina-based methods, but is relatively slow. We aimed to evaluate this approach using nanopore sequencing to provide more rapid results.

MethodsPatients with suspected sepsis in 4 intensive care units were prospectively enrolled. Human-depleted DNA was extracted from positive BC broths and sequenced using nanopore (MinION). Species abundance was estimated using Kraken2, and a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system (AREScloud) provided in silico antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) from assembled contigs. These results were compared to conventional identification and phenotypic AST.

ResultsGenus-level agreement between conventional methods and metagenomic whole genome sequencing (MG-WGS) was 96.2% (50/52), but increased to 100% in monomicrobial infections. In total, 262 high quality AREScloud AST predictions across 24 samples were made, exhibiting categorical agreement (CA) of 89.3%, with major error (MA) and very major error (VME) rates of 10.5% and 12.1%, respectively. Over 90% CA was achieved for some taxa (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), but was suboptimal for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CA 50%). In 470 AST predictions across 42 samples, with both high quality and exploratory-only predictions, overall CA, ME and VME rates were 87.7%, 8.3% and 28.4%. VME rates were inflated by false susceptibility calls in a small number of species / antibiotic combinations with few representative resistant isolates. Time to reporting from MG-WGS could be achieved within 8-16 hours from blood culture positivity.

ConclusionsDirect metagenomic sequencing from positive BC broths is feasible and can provide accurate predictive AST for some species and antibiotics, but is sub-optimal for a subset of common pathogens, with unacceptably high VME rates. Nanopore-based approaches may be faster but improvements in accuracy are required before it can be considered for clinical use. New developments in nanopore sequencing technology, and training of AI algorithms on larger and more diverse datasets may improve performance.</p>
