D.; Kumar, N.; Martin, J. N.; Gambhir, A.; Somsouk, M.; Seo, Y.; Deeks, S. G.; Laszik, Z. G.; VanBrocklin, H. F.; Henrich, T. J.\nScore: 1770.9, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293177\nThe etiologic mechanisms of post-acute medical morbidities and unexplained symptoms (Long COVID) following SARS-CoV-2 infection are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence and immune dysregulation may play a major role. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, [18F]F-AraG, a highly selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the post-acute COVID group, which included those with and without Long COVID symptoms, was significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic controls in many anatomical regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. Although T cell activation tended to be higher in participants imaged closer to the time of the acute illness, tracer uptake was increased in participants imaged up to 2.5 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that T cell activation in spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of Long COVID symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Notably, increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without Long COVID. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of participants with Long COVID symptoms. We identified cellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all these participants, ranging from 158 to 676 days following initial COVID-19 illness, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunological perturbations.\nPublished benefits of ivermectin use in Itajai, Brazil for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality are entirely explained by statistical artefacts\nAuthors: Mills, R.; Pecanha Antonio, A. C.; Tucker-Kellogg, G.\nScore: 65.7, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924\nBackground Two recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020. Methods Starting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect. Results Untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship. Conclusions The inference of ivermectin efficacy reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.\nWaning of post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Jacobsen, H.; Sitaras, I.; Katzmarzyk, M.; Cobos Jimenez, V.; Naughton, R.; Higdon, M. M.; Deloria Knoll, M.\nScore: 65.1, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293864\nBackgroundMass COVID-19 vaccination and the continuous introduction of new viral variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially of Omicron subvariants, has resulted in an increase in the proportion of the population with hybrid immunity at various stages of waning protection. We systematically reviewed waning of post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers in different immunological settings to investigate potential differences. MethodsWe searched for studies providing data for post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from Dec 15, 2021, to Jan 31, 2023, using keywords related to COVID-19, vaccination, and antibody neutralization. We used random effects meta-regression to estimate the average fold-reduction in post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against the Index strain or Omicron BA.1. from month 1 to month 6 post last dose, stratified by vaccination regimen (primary or booster) and infection-naive vs hybrid-immune status. FindingsIn total, 26 studies reporting longitudinal post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were included. Neutralization titers against the Index variant were available from all studies for infection-naive participants, and from nine for hybrid-immune participants. Against Omicron BA.1, nine and eight studies were available for infection-naive and hybrid-immune cohorts, respectively. In infection-naive cohorts, post-vaccination neutralization titers against the Index strain waned 5.1-fold (95% CI 3.4-7.8) from month 1 to month 6 following primary regimen and 3.8-fold (95% CI 2.4-5.9) following the booster. Titers against Omicron BA.1 waned 5.9-fold (95% CI 3.8-9.0) in infection-naive, post-booster cohorts. In hybrid-immune, post-primary vaccination cohorts, titers waned 3.7-fold (95% CI 1.7-7.9) against the Index strain and 5.0-fold (95% CI 1.1-21.8) against Omicron BA.1. InterpretationNo obvious differences in waning between post-primary or post-boost vaccination were observed for vaccines used widely to date, nor between infection-naive and hybrid-immune participants. Titers against Omicron BA.1 may wane faster compared to Index titers, which may worsen for more recent Omicron sub-variants and should be monitored. Relatively small datasets limit the precision of our current analysis; further investigation is needed when more data become available. However, based on our current findings, striking differences in waning for the analyzed and future comparisons are unlikely.\nSelf-tests for COVID-19: what is the evidence? A living systematic review and meta-analysis (2020-2023)\nAuthors: Anand, A.; Vialard, F.; Esmail, A.; Ahmad Khan, F.; O'Byrne, P.; Routy, J.-P.; Dheda, K.; Pant Pai, N.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293885\nCOVID-19 self-testing strategy (COVIDST) can rapidly identify symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and their contacts, potentially reducing transmission. In this living systematic review, we evaluated the evidence for real-world COVIDST performance. Two independent reviewers searched six databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, World Health Organization database, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, Europe PMC) for the period April 1st, 2020, to January 18th, 2023. Data on studies evaluating COVIDST against laboratory-based conventional testing and reported on diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, impact, and qualitative outcomes were abstracted. Bivariate random effects meta-analyses of COVIDST accuracy were performed (n=14). Subgroup analyses (by sampling site, symptomatic/asymptomatic infection, supervised/unsupervised strategy, with/without digital supports) were conducted. Data from 70 included studies, conducted across 25 countries with a median sample size of 817 (range: 28-784,707) were pooled. Specificity was high overall, irrespective of subgroups (98.37-99.71%). Highest sensitivities were reported for: a) symptomatic individuals (73.91%, 95%CI: 68.41-78.75%; n=9), b) mid-turbinate nasal samples (77.79%, 95%CI: 56.03-90.59%; n=14), c) supervised strategy (86.67%, 95%CI: 59.64-96.62%; n=13), and d) presence of digital interventions (70.15%, 95%CI: 50.18-84.63%; n=14). Sensitivity was lower in asymptomatic populations (40.18%, 95% CI: 21.52-62.20%; n=4), due to errors in test conduct and absence of supervision or a digital support. We found no difference in COVIDST sensitivity between delta and omicron pre-dominant period. Digital supports increased confidence in COVIDST reporting and interpretation (n=16). Overall acceptability was 91.0-98.7% (n=2) with lower acceptability reported for daily self-testing (39.5-51.1%). Feasibility was 69.0-100.0% (n=5) with lower feasibility (35.9-64.6%) for serial self-testing. COVIDST decreased closures in school, workplace, and social events (n=4). COVIDST is an effective rapid screening strategy for home-, workplace- or school-based screening, for symptomatic persons, and for preventing transmission during outbreaks. This data is useful for updating COVIDST policy. Our review demonstrates that COVIDST has paved the way for the introduction of self-tests, worldwide.\nPost-COVID conditions during Delta and early-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant periods among adults in the United States\nAuthors: Edwards, D. L.; Logan, P.; Feldstein, L.; Accorsi, E.; Fairlie, T.; Saydah, S.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293776\nBackground: Post-COVID conditions after infection with new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been incompletely described. We compared the prevalence and risk factors for ongoing symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer (often referred to as post-COVID Conditions) among adults who had tested positive vs. negative during the Delta and early-Omicron periods. Methods: Self-reported survey data regarding symptoms and previous SARS-CoV-2 test results were collected from May 31 - July 6, 2022, from a probability sampling of United States adults. Respondents were classified according to their test result, predominant circulating variant when respondents first tested positive (Delta vs early-Omicron), and demographic risk factors. Results: Among 2,421 respondents, 256 tested positive during Delta, 460 during early-Omicron, and 1,705 always tested negative. Nearly one-fourth (22.3%) of negative respondents reported at least 1 symptom that lasted 4 or more weeks, compared to 60.6% (p\u003c0.05) of respondents who tested positive during the Delta period and 47.8% (p\u003c0.05) during the early-Omicron period. Fatigue, change in smell/taste, and cough were commonly reported by respondents who tested positive. Demographic risk factors associated with ongoing symptoms were being female and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55; aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.87). Conclusion: The reported occurrence of ongoing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions was reduced during the early-Omicron period, compared with Delta.\nThe post-COVID-19 population has a high prevalence of crossreactive antibodies to spikes from all Orthocoronavirinae genera\nAuthors: Singh, G.; Abbad, A.; Kleiner, G.; Srivastava, K.; Gleason, C.; Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.\nScore: 51.2, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293522\nThe Orthocoronaviridae subfamily is large comprising four highly divergent genera. Four seasonal coronaviruses were circulating in humans prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Infection with these viruses induced antibody responses that are relatively narrow with little cross-reactivity to spike proteins of other coronaviruses. Here, we report that infection with and vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces broadly crossreactive binding antibodies to spikes from a wide range of coronaviruses including members of the sarbecovirus subgenus, betacoronaviruses including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and extending to alpha-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus spikes. These data show that the coronavirus spike antibody landscape in humans has profoundly been changed and broadened as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While we do not understand the functionality of these crossreactive antibodies, they may lead to enhanced resistance of the population to infection with newly emerging coronaviruses with pandemic potential.\nGenetic Variant rs1205 is Associated with COVID-19 Outcomes: The Strong Heart Study and Strong Heart Family Study.\nAuthors: Best, L. G.; Erdei, E.; Haack, K.; Kent, J. W.; Malloy, K.; Newman, D. E.; O'Leary, M.; O'Leary, R.; Sun, Q.; Navas-Acien, A.; Franceschini, N.; Cole, S. A.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.23293551\nBackgroundAlthough COVID-19 infection has been associated with a number of clinical and environmental risk factors, host genetic variation has also been associated with the incidence and morbidity of infection. The CRP gene codes for a critical component of the innate immune system and CRP variants have been reported associated with infectious disease and vaccination outcomes. We investigated possible associations between COVID-19 outcome and a limited number of candidate gene variants including rs1205. Methodology/Principal FindingsThe Strong Heart and Strong Heart Family studies have accumulated detailed genetic, cardiovascular risk and event data in geographically dispersed American Indian communities since 1988. Chi-square tests, logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models (implemented in SOLAR) were used in analysis. Genotypic data and 91 COVID-19 adjudicated deaths or hospitalizations from 2/1/20 through 3/1/23 were identified among 3,780 participants in two subsets. Among 21 candidate variants including genes in the interferon response pathway, APOE, TMPRSS2, TLR3, the HLA complex and the ABO blood group, only rs1205, a 3 untranslated region variant in the CRP gene, showed nominally significant association in T-dominant model analyses (odds ratio 1.859, 95%CI 1.001-3.453, p=0.049) after adjustment for age, sex, center, body mass index, and a history of cardiovascular disease. Within the younger subset, association with the rs1205 T-Dom genotype was stronger, both in the same adjusted logistic model and in the SOLAR analysis also adjusting for other genetic relatedness. ConclusionA T-dominant genotype of rs1205 in the CRP gene is associated with COVID-19 death or hospitalization, even after adjustment for relevant clinical factors and potential participant relatedness. Additional study of other populations and genetic variants of this gene are warranted. Author summaryConsiderable inter-individual variability in COVID-19 clinical outcome has been noted from the onset of this pandemic. Some risk factors, such as age, diabetes, obesity, prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well established. The possibility of inherited, host genetic risk factors has also been examined and a number validated in very large, population based datasets. The present study leveraged on-going clinical surveillance of CVD and available genetic information in an American Indian population to investigate potential host genetic contributors to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Although the number of cases ascertained was relatively small, a novel variant in the C-reactive protein gene was found to be associated with COVID-19 outcome. This protein constitutes a critical component of the innate immune system and CRP variants have been reported associated with infectious disease and vaccination outcomes. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this infection may allow more targeted therapy.\nSARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Non-Pharmacologic Interventions Temporally Associated with Reduced Pediatric Infections Due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Co-Infecting Respiratory Viruses in Arkansas\nAuthors: Boyanton, B. L.; Frenner, R. A.; Ingold, A.; Ambroggio, L.; Kennedy, J. L.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.23293566\nIntroductionNon-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs), such as universal masking, implemented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have reduced respiratory infections among children. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of NPIs on Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children, analyzing data from two hospitals in Arkansas, and examining age-related differences and coinfections with other viruses. MethodsThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and included patients aged [\u0026le;]18 years with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Data from the FilmArray(R) Respiratory Panel (FARP) were collected and divided into pre-NPI and NPI periods for analysis. Total test positivity rate and interval change in the positivity rate were evaluated. Statistical differences were determined by Chi-square ({chi}2-independence) analysis. ResultsA total of 68,949 tests were performed with a statistical increase in testing during the NPI period. The overall test positivity rate for M. pneumoniae decreased by 74% (0.86% to 0.03%) during the NPI period, and the preschool age group had the highest number of positive tests in the pre- and NPI periods (Pre-NPI: n=40, NPI: n=12 positive tests, p=\u003c0.001). The reduction in M. pneumoniae infections was consistent across age groups. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses, particularly human rhinovirus/enterovirus, were observed at much lower levels. ConclusionsNPIs effectively reduced M. pneumoniae in pediatric patients in Arkansas, and coinfections with specific viruses still occurred, albeit at lower levels during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As NPIs are relaxed and the pandemic ends, we expect M. pneumoniae infections to return to pre-pandemic levels within the next 1-2 years.\nEffectiveness of one dose of killed oral cholera vaccine in an endemic community in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A matched case-control study\nAuthors: Malembaka, E. B.; Bugeme, P. M.; Hutchins, C.; Xu, H.; Dent, J. D.; Demby, M. N.; Gallandat, K.; Saidi, J. M.; Rumedeka, B. B.; Itongwa, M.; Tshiwedi-Tsilabia, E.; Kitoga, F.; Bodisa-Matamu, T.; Kavunga-Membo, H.; Kulondwa, J.-C.; Bengehya, J.; Debes, A. K.; Taty, N.; Lee, E. C.; Lessler, J.; Leung, D. T.; Cumming, O.; Okitayemba, P. W.; Mukadi-Bamuleka, D.; Knee, J.; Azman, A. S.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.23293369\nBackgroundA global shortage of cholera vaccines has increased use of single-dose regimens, rather than the standard two-dose regimen. There is limited evidence on single-dose protection, particularly in children. In late 2020 a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in Uvira, a cholera endemic urban setting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Coverage surveys showed that the majority of vaccinated people received only one dose. We examined the effectiveness of a single-dose of the oral cholera vaccine Euvichol-plus in this high-burden setting. MethodsIn this case-control study, we recruited medically-attended confirmed cholera cases and age-, sex-, and neighborhood-matched community controls during two distinct periods after mass vaccination, October 2021 to March 2022 (12-17 months post-vaccination) and October 2022 to May 2023 (24-31 months post-vaccination). The odds of vaccination in cases and controls were contrasted in conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted vaccine effectiveness. FindingsWe enrolled 432 confirmed cases and 1554 matched controls during the two study periods with 21.5% of cases being under five years old. The adjusted single-dose VE was 52% (95% CI: 32{middle dot}3-66) 12-17 months post-vaccination and 40{middle dot}8% (95% CI: 8{middle dot}6-61{middle dot}7) 24-31 months post-vaccination. Combining the two study periods led to an adjusted single-dose VE of 45% (95% CI 28{middle dot}2-57{middle dot}8), with no significant differences among children under five years old and older individuals. InterpretationA single-dose of Euvichol-Plus provided substantial protection against medically-attended cholera for at least 31 months post-vaccination in this cholera endemic setting.

I.; Ahmed, N.; Figgins, M.; Colizza, V.; Lemey, P.; McCrone, J. T.; Müller, N. F.; Tran-Kiem, C.; Bedford, T.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293266\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. It is still unclear to what extent international travel contributed to the explosive spread of mpox and the degree to which national vaccination campaigns were responsible for controlling the epidemic. We built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes sampled between March 2022 and January 2023 from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data to analyze the global spread of mpox. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection by local surveillance, changes in case-reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. Additionally, we find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that the time-varying effective reproductive number in North America declines below one before more than 10% of individuals at high risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity, suggesting little impact of vaccination in controlling the epidemic. Given that cases quickly declined after detection most likely due to behavioral modifications, our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The etiologic mechanisms of post-acute medical morbidities and unexplained symptoms (Long COVID) following SARS-CoV-2 infection are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence and immune dysregulation may play a major role. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, [18F]F-AraG, a highly selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the post-acute COVID group, which included those with and without Long COVID symptoms, was significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic controls in many anatomical regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. Although T cell activation tended to be higher in participants imaged closer to the time of the acute illness, tracer uptake was increased in participants imaged up to 2.5 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that T cell activation in spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of Long COVID symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Notably, increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without Long COVID. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of participants with Long COVID symptoms. We identified cellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all these participants, ranging from 158 to 676 days following initial COVID-19 illness, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunological perturbations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Two recent publications by Kerr et al. (Cureus 14(1):e21272; Cureus 14(8): e28624) reported dramatic effects of prophylactic ivermectin use for both prevention of COVID-19 and reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality, including a dose-dependent effect of ivermectin prophylaxis. These papers have gained an unusually large public influence: they were incorporated into debates around COVID-19 policies and may have contributed to decreased trust in vaccine efficacy and public health authorities more broadly. Both studies were based on retrospective observational analysis of city-wide registry data from the city of Itajai, Brazil from July-December 2020. Methods Starting with initially identified sources of error, we conducted a revised statistical analysis of available data, including data made available with the original papers and public data from the Brazil Ministry of Health. We identified additional uncorrected sources of bias and errors from the original analysis, including incorrect subject exclusion and missing subjects, an enrolment time bias, and multiple sources of immortal time bias. In models assuming no actual effect from ivermectin use, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the contribution of these biases to any observed effect. Results Untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors alone lead to dramatic apparent risk reduction associated with ivermectin use in both studies. The magnitude of apparent risk reduction from these artefacts is comparable to the results reported by the studies themselves, including apparent protection from infection, hospitalisation, and death, and including the reported apparent dose-response relationship. Conclusions The inference of ivermectin efficacy reported in both papers is unsupported, as the observed effects are entirely explained by untreated statistical artefacts and methodological errors. Our re-analysis calls for caution in interpreting highly publicised observational studies and highlights the importance of common sources of bias in clinical research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMass COVID-19 vaccination and the continuous introduction of new viral variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially of Omicron subvariants, has resulted in an increase in the proportion of the population with hybrid immunity at various stages of waning protection. We systematically reviewed waning of post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers in different immunological settings to investigate potential differences.

MethodsWe searched for studies providing data for post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from Dec 15, 2021, to Jan 31, 2023, using keywords related to COVID-19, vaccination, and antibody neutralization. We used random effects meta-regression to estimate the average fold-reduction in post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against the Index strain or Omicron BA.1. from month 1 to month 6 post last dose, stratified by vaccination regimen (primary or booster) and infection-naive vs hybrid-immune status.

FindingsIn total, 26 studies reporting longitudinal post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were included. Neutralization titers against the Index variant were available from all studies for infection-naive participants, and from nine for hybrid-immune participants. Against Omicron BA.1, nine and eight studies were available for infection-naive and hybrid-immune cohorts, respectively. In infection-naive cohorts, post-vaccination neutralization titers against the Index strain waned 5.1-fold (95% CI 3.4-7.8) from month 1 to month 6 following primary regimen and 3.8-fold (95% CI 2.4-5.9) following the booster. Titers against Omicron BA.1 waned 5.9-fold (95% CI 3.8-9.0) in infection-naive, post-booster cohorts. In hybrid-immune, post-primary vaccination cohorts, titers waned 3.7-fold (95% CI 1.7-7.9) against the Index strain and 5.0-fold (95% CI 1.1-21.8) against Omicron BA.1.

InterpretationNo obvious differences in waning between post-primary or post-boost vaccination were observed for vaccines used widely to date, nor between infection-naive and hybrid-immune participants. Titers against Omicron BA.1 may wane faster compared to Index titers, which may worsen for more recent Omicron sub-variants and should be monitored. Relatively small datasets limit the precision of our current analysis; further investigation is needed when more data become available. However, based on our current findings, striking differences in waning for the analyzed and future comparisons are unlikely.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 self-testing strategy (COVIDST) can rapidly identify symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and their contacts, potentially reducing transmission. In this living systematic review, we evaluated the evidence for real-world COVIDST performance. Two independent reviewers searched six databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, World Health Organization database, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, Europe PMC) for the period April 1st, 2020, to January 18th, 2023. Data on studies evaluating COVIDST against laboratory-based conventional testing and reported on diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, impact, and qualitative outcomes were abstracted. Bivariate random effects meta-analyses of COVIDST accuracy were performed (n=14). Subgroup analyses (by sampling site, symptomatic/asymptomatic infection, supervised/unsupervised strategy, with/without digital supports) were conducted. Data from 70 included studies, conducted across 25 countries with a median sample size of 817 (range: 28-784,707) were pooled. Specificity was high overall, irrespective of subgroups (98.37-99.71%). Highest sensitivities were reported for: a) symptomatic individuals (73.91%, 95%CI: 68.41-78.75%; n=9), b) mid-turbinate nasal samples (77.79%, 95%CI: 56.03-90.59%; n=14), c) supervised strategy (86.67%, 95%CI: 59.64-96.62%; n=13), and d) presence of digital interventions (70.15%, 95%CI: 50.18-84.63%; n=14). Sensitivity was lower in asymptomatic populations (40.18%, 95% CI: 21.52-62.20%; n=4), due to errors in test conduct and absence of supervision or a digital support. We found no difference in COVIDST sensitivity between delta and omicron pre-dominant period. Digital supports increased confidence in COVIDST reporting and interpretation (n=16). Overall acceptability was 91.0-98.7% (n=2) with lower acceptability reported for daily self-testing (39.5-51.1%). Feasibility was 69.0-100.0% (n=5) with lower feasibility (35.9-64.6%) for serial self-testing. COVIDST decreased closures in school, workplace, and social events (n=4). COVIDST is an effective rapid screening strategy for home-, workplace- or school-based screening, for symptomatic persons, and for preventing transmission during outbreaks. This data is useful for updating COVIDST policy. Our review demonstrates that COVIDST has paved the way for the introduction of self-tests, worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Post-COVID conditions after infection with new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been incompletely described. We compared the prevalence and risk factors for ongoing symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer (often referred to as post-COVID Conditions) among adults who had tested positive vs. negative during the Delta and early-Omicron periods. Methods: Self-reported survey data regarding symptoms and previous SARS-CoV-2 test results were collected from May 31 - July 6, 2022, from a probability sampling of United States adults. Respondents were classified according to their test result, predominant circulating variant when respondents first tested positive (Delta vs early-Omicron), and demographic risk factors. Results: Among 2,421 respondents, 256 tested positive during Delta, 460 during early-Omicron, and 1,705 always tested negative. Nearly one-fourth (22.3%) of negative respondents reported at least 1 symptom that lasted 4 or more weeks, compared to 60.6% (p&lt;0.05) of respondents who tested positive during the Delta period and 47.8% (p&lt;0.05) during the early-Omicron period. Fatigue, change in smell/taste, and cough were commonly reported by respondents who tested positive. Demographic risk factors associated with ongoing symptoms were being female and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55; aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.87). Conclusion: The reported occurrence of ongoing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions was reduced during the early-Omicron period, compared with Delta.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Orthocoronaviridae subfamily is large comprising four highly divergent genera. Four seasonal coronaviruses were circulating in humans prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Infection with these viruses induced antibody responses that are relatively narrow with little cross-reactivity to spike proteins of other coronaviruses. Here, we report that infection with and vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces broadly crossreactive binding antibodies to spikes from a wide range of coronaviruses including members of the sarbecovirus subgenus, betacoronaviruses including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and extending to alpha-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus spikes. These data show that the coronavirus spike antibody landscape in humans has profoundly been changed and broadened as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While we do not understand the functionality of these crossreactive antibodies, they may lead to enhanced resistance of the population to infection with newly emerging coronaviruses with pandemic potential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlthough COVID-19 infection has been associated with a number of clinical and environmental risk factors, host genetic variation has also been associated with the incidence and morbidity of infection. The CRP gene codes for a critical component of the innate immune system and CRP variants have been reported associated with infectious disease and vaccination outcomes. We investigated possible associations between COVID-19 outcome and a limited number of candidate gene variants including rs1205.

Methodology/Principal FindingsThe Strong Heart and Strong Heart Family studies have accumulated detailed genetic, cardiovascular risk and event data in geographically dispersed American Indian communities since 1988. Chi-square tests, logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models (implemented in SOLAR) were used in analysis. Genotypic data and 91 COVID-19 adjudicated deaths or hospitalizations from 2/1/20 through 3/1/23 were identified among 3,780 participants in two subsets. Among 21 candidate variants including genes in the interferon response pathway, APOE, TMPRSS2, TLR3, the HLA complex and the ABO blood group, only rs1205, a 3 untranslated region variant in the CRP gene, showed nominally significant association in T-dominant model analyses (odds ratio 1.859, 95%CI 1.001-3.453, p=0.049) after adjustment for age, sex, center, body mass index, and a history of cardiovascular disease. Within the younger subset, association with the rs1205 T-Dom genotype was stronger, both in the same adjusted logistic model and in the SOLAR analysis also adjusting for other genetic relatedness.

ConclusionA T-dominant genotype of rs1205 in the CRP gene is associated with COVID-19 death or hospitalization, even after adjustment for relevant clinical factors and potential participant relatedness. Additional study of other populations and genetic variants of this gene are warranted.

Author summaryConsiderable inter-individual variability in COVID-19 clinical outcome has been noted from the onset of this pandemic. Some risk factors, such as age, diabetes, obesity, prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well established. The possibility of inherited, host genetic risk factors has also been examined and a number validated in very large, population based datasets. The present study leveraged on-going clinical surveillance of CVD and available genetic information in an American Indian population to investigate potential host genetic contributors to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Although the number of cases ascertained was relatively small, a novel variant in the C-reactive protein gene was found to be associated with COVID-19 outcome. This protein constitutes a critical component of the innate immune system and CRP variants have been reported associated with infectious disease and vaccination outcomes. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this infection may allow more targeted therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionNon-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs), such as universal masking, implemented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have reduced respiratory infections among children. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of NPIs on Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children, analyzing data from two hospitals in Arkansas, and examining age-related differences and coinfections with other viruses.

MethodsThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and included patients aged [&amp;le;]18 years with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Data from the FilmArray(R) Respiratory Panel (FARP) were collected and divided into pre-NPI and NPI periods for analysis. Total test positivity rate and interval change in the positivity rate were evaluated. Statistical differences were determined by Chi-square ({chi}2-independence) analysis.

ResultsA total of 68,949 tests were performed with a statistical increase in testing during the NPI period. The overall test positivity rate for M. pneumoniae decreased by 74% (0.86% to 0.03%) during the NPI period, and the preschool age group had the highest number of positive tests in the pre- and NPI periods (Pre-NPI: n=40, NPI: n=12 positive tests, p=&lt;0.001). The reduction in M. pneumoniae infections was consistent across age groups. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses, particularly human rhinovirus/enterovirus, were observed at much lower levels.

ConclusionsNPIs effectively reduced M. pneumoniae in pediatric patients in Arkansas, and coinfections with specific viruses still occurred, albeit at lower levels during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As NPIs are relaxed and the pandemic ends, we expect M. pneumoniae infections to return to pre-pandemic levels within the next 1-2 years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA global shortage of cholera vaccines has increased use of single-dose regimens, rather than the standard two-dose regimen. There is limited evidence on single-dose protection, particularly in children. In late 2020 a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in Uvira, a cholera endemic urban setting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Coverage surveys showed that the majority of vaccinated people received only one dose. We examined the effectiveness of a single-dose of the oral cholera vaccine Euvichol-plus in this high-burden setting.

MethodsIn this case-control study, we recruited medically-attended confirmed cholera cases and age-, sex-, and neighborhood-matched community controls during two distinct periods after mass vaccination, October 2021 to March 2022 (12-17 months post-vaccination) and October 2022 to May 2023 (24-31 months post-vaccination). The odds of vaccination in cases and controls were contrasted in conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted vaccine effectiveness.

FindingsWe enrolled 432 confirmed cases and 1554 matched controls during the two study periods with 21.5% of cases being under five years old. The adjusted single-dose VE was 52% (95% CI: 32{middle dot}3-66) 12-17 months post-vaccination and 40{middle dot}8% (95% CI: 8{middle dot}6-61{middle dot}7) 24-31 months post-vaccination. Combining the two study periods led to an adjusted single-dose VE of 45% (95% CI 28{middle dot}2-57{middle dot}8), with no significant differences among children under five years old and older individuals.

InterpretationA single-dose of Euvichol-Plus provided substantial protection against medically-attended cholera for at least 31 months post-vaccination in this cholera endemic setting.

        <p class="abstract">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. It is still unclear to what extent international travel contributed to the explosive spread of mpox and the degree to which national vaccination campaigns were responsible for controlling the epidemic. We built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes sampled between March 2022 and January 2023 from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data to analyze the global spread of mpox. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection by local surveillance, changes in case-reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. Additionally, we find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that the time-varying effective reproductive number in North America declines below one before more than 10% of individuals at high risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity, suggesting little impact of vaccination in controlling the epidemic. Given that cases quickly declined after detection most likely due to behavioral modifications, our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases.</p>
