Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels \u003e90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.\nInforming the need for a SARS-CoV-2 booster based upon the immune response among young healthy adults to variants circulating during late 2023\nAuthors: Nguyen, H. C.; Lal, K. G.; Balinsky, C. A.; Smith, L.; Pan, L.; Cheng, Y.; Fox, I.; Hontz, R. D.; Lizewski, S. E.; Foo, H. S.; Krebs, S. J.; Sun, P.; Letizia, A. G.\nScore: 38.0, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300003\nCOVID-19 remains a global public health challenge due to ongoing emergence of new immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, heterogeneous immunity, poor education campaigns, and suboptimal surveillance. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the adaptive immune responses in US active-duty service members who completed a COVID-19 primary vaccine series to 3 previously dominant variants (Ancestral, Delta, BA.5) and compared them to 3 variants currently circulating (XBB.1.5, EG.5, and BA.2.86). Analyses were performed based upon time (within or beyond 12 months) and type (vaccine or infection) of most recent exposure. Significant reduction was observed in binding antibodies, neutralization antibodies, memory B cells, and CD8+ T cells against current circulating variants compared to previous dominant variants. The reduction in antibody response was more pronounced in those whose most recent exposure, regardless if vaccination or infection, was greater than 12 months from study enrollment. In contrast, the CD4+ T cell response was largely consistent across all tested variants. Our study did not show that the type exposure in the last 12 months was a significant factor in determining the magnitude of immune responses. However, the antibody responses to circulating variants were decreased among participants who received the bivalent booster compared to those with an infection in the past 12 months, potentially due to immunological imprinting of the Ancestral strain. Administration of the new XBB.1.5-based booster is likely to enhance cross-reactive humoral immune responses against current SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains.\nBeyond Borders: Spatial Disparities in the Mortality Burden of the Covid-19 pandemic across 569 European Regions (2020-2021)\nAuthors: Bonnet, F.; Grigoriev, P.; Sauerberg, M.; Alliger, I.; Muhlichen, M.; Camarda, C.-G.\nScore: 31.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300149\nThis article presents a detailed analysis of the global mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 regions in 25 European countries. We produce sex-specific excess mortality and present our results using Age-Standardised Years of Life Lost (ASYLL) in 2020 and 2021, as well as the cumulative impact over the two pandemic years. Employing a robust forecasting approach that considers regional diversity and provides confidence intervals, we find notable losses in 362 regions in 2020 (440 regions in 2021). Conversely, only seven regions experienced gains in 2020 (four regions in 2021). Most importantly, we estimate that eight regions suffered losses exceeding 20 years of life per 1,000 population in 2020, whereas this number increased to 75 regions in 2021. The contiguity of the regions investigated in our study also reveals the changing geographical patterns of the pandemic. While the highest excess mortality values were concentrated in the early COVID-19 outbreak areas during the initial pandemic year, a clear East-West gradient appeared in 2021, with regions of Slovakia, Hungary, and Latvia experiencing the highest losses. This research underscores the importance of regional analyses for a nuanced comprehension of the pandemics impact.\nEmergence and predominance of novel influenza A (H3N2) subclade (3C.2a1b.2a.2a.3a.1) in Kenya and globally in 2023\nAuthors: Morobe, J.

V.; Fernando, S.; Danasekara, S.; Jayakody, G.; Arulkumaran, S.; Samaraweera, N. Y.; Kumarawansha, S.; Sivaganesh, S.; Amarasinghe, P. G.; Jayasinghe, C.; Wijesekara, D.; Marasinghe, M. B.; Mambulage, U.; Wijayatilaka, H.; Seneviratne, K.; Bandara, A. D. P.; Gallage, C. P.; Colambage, N. R.; Udayasiri, T. T.; Lokumarambage, T.; Upasena, Y.; Weerasooriya, W. P. K. P.; Seroprevalence Study Group, ; Tang, T. K.; Townsend, A.; Ogg, G. S.; Malavige, G. N.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300176\nBackgroundWe investigated the seropositivity rates of Sri Lankan children in a large island wide serosurvey, to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and the association with the vaccination and nutritional status to understand the likely impact of newer variants in Sri Lanka. MethodsUsing the WHO UNITY protocol, we recruited 5207 children, aged 10 to 20 years, representative of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka, and assessed seropositive rates, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to BA.2.75 and XBB.1.5, in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine the association between nutrition status and antibody levels. Results3111/3119 (99.7%) vaccinated and 2008/2088 (96.2%) of unvaccinated children, were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 2984/3111 (95.9%) of vaccinated children had ACE2 blocking antibodies above the cut-off threshold, compared to 1346/2008 (67.0%) of unvaccinated children. 27.2 % unvaccinated children had positive antibody responses to BA.2.75 and 30.7% to XBB.1.5, while 64.3% of vaccinated had a positive response to BA.2.75 and 43.1% to XBB.1.5. Vaccinated children had significantly higher titres of total antibodies, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 than unvaccinated children. However, the vaccinated had significantly higher responses to BA.2.75 (p\u003c0.0001), than XBB.1.5. Unvaccinated children, with \u003c3rd BMI centile had significantly lower ACE2 blocking antibodies than other groups. DiscussionThe high seropositivity rates and antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 variants in unvaccinated children, suggests that they are likely to have been infected more than once with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of lower antibody levels in undernourished children should be further investigated.\nEvaluation of non-contact infrared thermometers for COVID-19 fever screening in healthcare workers: A prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital\nAuthors: Rajakumar, R.; Dorairajan, S. K.; Magesh, P.; Kalyani, P.; Soundarajan, P.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300100\nAbstract: Background: In the fight against COVID-19, efficient fever screening was essential to curb transmission. Fever served as a cardinal symptom, aiding early and timely identification of fever among healthcare workers (HCWs) was crucial. While non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) offered non-invasive screening, existing data gaps were present. This study aimed to assess the NCIT effectiveness in HCW fever screening by comparing results with serology and RT-PCR tests, ascertaining their utility in healthcare settings for COVID-19 detection. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital with 250 beds in South India. The study population comprised 736 healthcare workers (HCWs) working in the hospital, and the study was carried out between April 2020 and December 2020. Daily fever screening using non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) was performed on all HCWs upon their entry to the hospital. Additionally, serological tests were offered to all HCWs starting from November 2020 to assess prior COVID-19 infection exposure. COVID-19 admissions were closely monitored during the study period to identify hospitalized HCWs with symptoms who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. Results: In this study cohort of 736 HCWs, 44,836 NCIT screenings revealed no fever cases. The serological analysis identified prior COVID-19 exposure in 229 HCWs. McNemar's test ({chi}2 = 26.27, p \u003c 0.05) emphasized discordance between NCIT and serology. ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.500, indicating NCIT's challenge in distinguishing febrile cases. Additionally, 68 symptomatic HCWs tested COVID-19 positive through RT-PCR, highlighting the role of complementary diagnostics. Conclusion: The failure of NCIT to identify fever cases in our study highlights the importance of incorporating supplementary screening methods and comprehensive strategies in future pandemic preparedness.

E.; Chilunda, V.; Heaton, P. R.; Grzymski, J.; Pawloski, P. A.; Goldman, J. D.; Luo, S.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300241\nWe estimated the proportion of hospitalizations that could have been averted had all eligible high-risk adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a clinical cohort been treated with an oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent early in infection. Among 3,037 patients with risk factors for progressing to severe COVID-19, 946 (31.1%) received an oral antiviral prescription (834 nirmatrelvir and 112 molnupiravir). Only 3.0% of treated patients vs 9.1% of untreated patients were hospitalized (adjusted risk ratio [RR]=0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.41). If all patients had been treated, an estimated 63.3% (95% CI: 50.4-75.1) of hospitalizations within 30 days could have been prevented. This finding is attributed to large gaps in treatment and a strong protective association of antiviral treatment with subsequent hospitalization.\nDiagnostic testing preferences can help inform future public health response efforts: global insights from an international survey\nAuthors: Salzano, L.; Narayanan, N.; Tobik, E. R.; Akbarzada, S.; Wu, Y.; Megiel, S.; Choate, B.; Wyllie, A. L.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299858\nIntroductionPublic perception regarding clinical diagnostic sample types as well as personal experiences can influence willingness to test. As such, public preferences for specific sample type(s) should be used to inform diagnostic and surveillance testing programs to improve public health response efforts. To understand where preferences lie, we conducted an international survey regarding sample types used for SARS-CoV-2 tests. MethodsA Qualtrics survey regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences was distributed via social media and email. The survey collected preferences regarding test sample types and key demographic data. Python was used to analyze survey responses. ResultsFrom March 30th to June 15th, 2022, 2,094 responses were collected from 125 countries. Participants were 55% female and predominantly aged 25-34 years (27%). Education and employment were skewed: 51% had graduate degrees, 26% had bachelors degrees, 27% were scientists/researchers, and 29% were healthcare workers. By rank sum analysis, the most preferred sample type globally was the oral swab, followed by saliva, with parents/guardians preferring saliva-based testing for children. Respondents indicated a higher degree of trust in PCR testing (84%) vs. rapid antigen testing (36%). Preferences for self- or healthcare worker-collected sampling varied across regions. ConclusionsThis international survey identified a preference for oral sample types when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, respondents indicated that if they could be assured that all sample types performed equally, then saliva was preferred. Overall, survey responses reflected the region-specific testing experiences during the COVID-19. Public preferences should be considered when designing future response efforts to increase utilization, with oral sample types providing a practical option for large-scale, accessible diagnostic testing.\nEffectiveness and durability of mRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine (mRNA-1273.222) against SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 and XBB sublineages\nAuthors: Ackerson, B. K.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Qian, L.; Sy, L. S.; Qiu, S.; Tubert, J. E.; Lee, G. S.; Ku, J. H.; Florea, A.; Luo, Y.; Bathala, R.; Stern, J.; Choi, S. K.; Takhar, H. S.; Aragones, M.; Marks, M. A.; Anderson, E. J.; Zhou, C. K.; Sun, T.; Talarico, C. A.; Tseng, H. F.\nScore: 90.8, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299663\nBackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for \u003e1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines. MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [\u0026ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization. ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses. ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.\nClinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease patients suffering from COVID-19 in Bangladesh: a prospective cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Ullah, A.; Khanam, A.; Mondal, M.; Haque, M. R.; Sumon, A. S. H.; Khan, S.; Haque, M. M.; Sumon, M. R.; Rahman, M. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300150\nBackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were susceptible to morbidity and mortality once they affected by COVID-19. These patients were more likely to develop severe disease, requiring dialysis, admission to intensive care unit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presentations and outcomes of COVID-19 in stage 3-5 CKD patients not on dialysis. MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted in the COVID-19 unit, at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka from September 2020 to August 2021. Hospitalized RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CKD having eGFR \u003c60 ml/min/1.73 m2 but not yet on dialysis were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. Outcomes were observed till discharge from the hospital and followed up after 3 months of survived patients. ResultsOut of 109 patients, the mean age was 58.1(SD: {+/-}15.4) years where 61.5% were male. Common co-morbid conditions were hypertension (89.0%), diabetes mellitus (58.7%) and ischemic heart disease (24.8%). Fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue were common presenting features. Most of the patients had moderate (41.3%) and severe (41.3%) COVID-19. Sixty-six patients (60.6%) developed AKI on CKD. Twenty patients (30.3%) required dialysis. Death occurred in 16 patients (14.7%) and 12 patients (11%) required ICU admission and 6 patients (9.1%) achieved baseline renal function at discharge. We identified risk factors like low haemoglobin, lymphopenia, high CRP, high procalcitonin, high LDH and low SpO2 in patients who did not survive. Seventy-six patients were followed up at 3rd month where 17 patients were lost. Ten patients (27.0%) achieved baseline renal function who had persistent AKI at discharge and 34 patients (87.1%) remained stable who had stable renal function at discharge. ConclusionThe stage 3-5 chronic kidney patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to severe to critical morbidity and mortality with higher incidence of AKI which demands a special attention to this group of patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Sero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels &gt;90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 remains a global public health challenge due to ongoing emergence of new immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, heterogeneous immunity, poor education campaigns, and suboptimal surveillance. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the adaptive immune responses in US active-duty service members who completed a COVID-19 primary vaccine series to 3 previously dominant variants (Ancestral, Delta, BA.5) and compared them to 3 variants currently circulating (XBB.1.5, EG.5, and BA.2.86). Analyses were performed based upon time (within or beyond 12 months) and type (vaccine or infection) of most recent exposure. Significant reduction was observed in binding antibodies, neutralization antibodies, memory B cells, and CD8&#43; T cells against current circulating variants compared to previous dominant variants. The reduction in antibody response was more pronounced in those whose most recent exposure, regardless if vaccination or infection, was greater than 12 months from study enrollment. In contrast, the CD4&#43; T cell response was largely consistent across all tested variants. Our study did not show that the type exposure in the last 12 months was a significant factor in determining the magnitude of immune responses. However, the antibody responses to circulating variants were decreased among participants who received the bivalent booster compared to those with an infection in the past 12 months, potentially due to immunological imprinting of the Ancestral strain. Administration of the new XBB.1.5-based booster is likely to enhance cross-reactive humoral immune responses against current SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This article presents a detailed analysis of the global mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 regions in 25 European countries. We produce sex-specific excess mortality and present our results using Age-Standardised Years of Life Lost (ASYLL) in 2020 and 2021, as well as the cumulative impact over the two pandemic years. Employing a robust forecasting approach that considers regional diversity and provides confidence intervals, we find notable losses in 362 regions in 2020 (440 regions in 2021). Conversely, only seven regions experienced gains in 2020 (four regions in 2021). Most importantly, we estimate that eight regions suffered losses exceeding 20 years of life per 1,000 population in 2020, whereas this number increased to 75 regions in 2021. The contiguity of the regions investigated in our study also reveals the changing geographical patterns of the pandemic. While the highest excess mortality values were concentrated in the early COVID-19 outbreak areas during the initial pandemic year, a clear East-West gradient appeared in 2021, with regions of Slovakia, Hungary, and Latvia experiencing the highest losses. This research underscores the importance of regional analyses for a nuanced comprehension of the pandemics impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe investigated the seropositivity rates of Sri Lankan children in a large island wide serosurvey, to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and the association with the vaccination and nutritional status to understand the likely impact of newer variants in Sri Lanka.

MethodsUsing the WHO UNITY protocol, we recruited 5207 children, aged 10 to 20 years, representative of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka, and assessed seropositive rates, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to BA.2.75 and XBB.1.5, in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine the association between nutrition status and antibody levels.

Results3111/3119 (99.7%) vaccinated and 2008/2088 (96.2%) of unvaccinated children, were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 2984/3111 (95.9%) of vaccinated children had ACE2 blocking antibodies above the cut-off threshold, compared to 1346/2008 (67.0%) of unvaccinated children. 27.2 % unvaccinated children had positive antibody responses to BA.2.75 and 30.7% to XBB.1.5, while 64.3% of vaccinated had a positive response to BA.2.75 and 43.1% to XBB.1.5. Vaccinated children had significantly higher titres of total antibodies, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 than unvaccinated children. However, the vaccinated had significantly higher responses to BA.2.75 (p&lt;0.0001), than XBB.1.5. Unvaccinated children, with &lt;3rd BMI centile had significantly lower ACE2 blocking antibodies than other groups.

DiscussionThe high seropositivity rates and antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 variants in unvaccinated children, suggests that they are likely to have been infected more than once with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of lower antibody levels in undernourished children should be further investigated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abstract: Background: In the fight against COVID-19, efficient fever screening was essential to curb transmission. Fever served as a cardinal symptom, aiding early and timely identification of fever among healthcare workers (HCWs) was crucial. While non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) offered non-invasive screening, existing data gaps were present. This study aimed to assess the NCIT effectiveness in HCW fever screening by comparing results with serology and RT-PCR tests, ascertaining their utility in healthcare settings for COVID-19 detection. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital with 250 beds in South India. The study population comprised 736 healthcare workers (HCWs) working in the hospital, and the study was carried out between April 2020 and December 2020. Daily fever screening using non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) was performed on all HCWs upon their entry to the hospital. Additionally, serological tests were offered to all HCWs starting from November 2020 to assess prior COVID-19 infection exposure. COVID-19 admissions were closely monitored during the study period to identify hospitalized HCWs with symptoms who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. Results: In this study cohort of 736 HCWs, 44,836 NCIT screenings revealed no fever cases. The serological analysis identified prior COVID-19 exposure in 229 HCWs. McNemar&#39;s test ({chi}2 = 26.27, p &lt; 0.05) emphasized discordance between NCIT and serology. ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.500, indicating NCIT&#39;s challenge in distinguishing febrile cases. Additionally, 68 symptomatic HCWs tested COVID-19 positive through RT-PCR, highlighting the role of complementary diagnostics. Conclusion: The failure of NCIT to identify fever cases in our study highlights the importance of incorporating supplementary screening methods and comprehensive strategies in future pandemic preparedness.

        <p class="abstract">We estimated the proportion of hospitalizations that could have been averted had all eligible high-risk adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a clinical cohort been treated with an oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent early in infection. Among 3,037 patients with risk factors for progressing to severe COVID-19, 946 (31.1%) received an oral antiviral prescription (834 nirmatrelvir and 112 molnupiravir). Only 3.0% of treated patients vs 9.1% of untreated patients were hospitalized (adjusted risk ratio [RR]=0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.41). If all patients had been treated, an estimated 63.3% (95% CI: 50.4-75.1) of hospitalizations within 30 days could have been prevented. This finding is attributed to large gaps in treatment and a strong protective association of antiviral treatment with subsequent hospitalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPublic perception regarding clinical diagnostic sample types as well as personal experiences can influence willingness to test. As such, public preferences for specific sample type(s) should be used to inform diagnostic and surveillance testing programs to improve public health response efforts. To understand where preferences lie, we conducted an international survey regarding sample types used for SARS-CoV-2 tests.

MethodsA Qualtrics survey regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences was distributed via social media and email. The survey collected preferences regarding test sample types and key demographic data. Python was used to analyze survey responses.

ResultsFrom March 30th to June 15th, 2022, 2,094 responses were collected from 125 countries. Participants were 55% female and predominantly aged 25-34 years (27%). Education and employment were skewed: 51% had graduate degrees, 26% had bachelors degrees, 27% were scientists/researchers, and 29% were healthcare workers. By rank sum analysis, the most preferred sample type globally was the oral swab, followed by saliva, with parents/guardians preferring saliva-based testing for children. Respondents indicated a higher degree of trust in PCR testing (84%) vs. rapid antigen testing (36%). Preferences for self- or healthcare worker-collected sampling varied across regions.

ConclusionsThis international survey identified a preference for oral sample types when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, respondents indicated that if they could be assured that all sample types performed equally, then saliva was preferred. Overall, survey responses reflected the region-specific testing experiences during the COVID-19. Public preferences should be considered when designing future response efforts to increase utilization, with oral sample types providing a practical option for large-scale, accessible diagnostic testing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for &gt;1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines.

MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [&amp;ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization.

ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses.

ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were susceptible to morbidity and mortality once they affected by COVID-19. These patients were more likely to develop severe disease, requiring dialysis, admission to intensive care unit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presentations and outcomes of COVID-19 in stage 3-5 CKD patients not on dialysis.

MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted in the COVID-19 unit, at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka from September 2020 to August 2021. Hospitalized RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CKD having eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 but not yet on dialysis were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. Outcomes were observed till discharge from the hospital and followed up after 3 months of survived patients.

ResultsOut of 109 patients, the mean age was 58.1(SD: {&#43;/-}15.4) years where 61.5% were male. Common co-morbid conditions were hypertension (89.0%), diabetes mellitus (58.7%) and ischemic heart disease (24.8%). Fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue were common presenting features. Most of the patients had moderate (41.3%) and severe (41.3%) COVID-19. Sixty-six patients (60.6%) developed AKI on CKD. Twenty patients (30.3%) required dialysis. Death occurred in 16 patients (14.7%) and 12 patients (11%) required ICU admission and 6 patients (9.1%) achieved baseline renal function at discharge. We identified risk factors like low haemoglobin, lymphopenia, high CRP, high procalcitonin, high LDH and low SpO2 in patients who did not survive. Seventy-six patients were followed up at 3rd month where 17 patients were lost. Ten patients (27.0%) achieved baseline renal function who had persistent AKI at discharge and 34 patients (87.1%) remained stable who had stable renal function at discharge.

ConclusionThe stage 3-5 chronic kidney patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to severe to critical morbidity and mortality with higher incidence of AKI which demands a special attention to this group of patients.</p>
