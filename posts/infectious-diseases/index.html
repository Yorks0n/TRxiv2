We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.\nAltered IgG4 Antibody Response to Repeated mRNA versus Protein COVID Vaccines\nAuthors: Kalkeri, R.; Zhu, M.; Cloney-Clark, S.; Plested, J. S.; Parekh, A.; Gorinson, D.; Cai, R.; Mahato, S.; Ramanathan, P.; Aurelia, L. C.; John Selva, K.; Marchese, A. M.; Fries, L.; Chung, A. W.; Dunkle, L. M.\nScore: 237.7, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301374\nRepeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.\nImpact of COVID-19 vaccination on symptoms and immune phenotypes in vaccine-naIÌˆve individuals with Long COVID\nAuthors: Grady, C.

M.; Guan, L.; Dela Cruz, C.; Iwasaki, A.; Krumholz, H.\nScore: 71.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24300929\nBackgroundLong COVID contributes to the global burden of disease. Proposed root cause hypotheses include the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoir, autoimmunity, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Patients have reported various changes in Long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccinations, leaving uncertainty about whether vaccine-induced immune responses may alleviate or worsen disease pathology. MethodsIn this prospective study, we evaluated changes in symptoms and immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in 16 vaccine-naive individuals with Long COVID. Surveys were administered before vaccination and then at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose of the primary series. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR enrichment, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, antibody responses to other viral and self-antigens, and circulating cytokines were quantified before vaccination and at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. ResultsSelf-report at 12 weeks post-vaccination indicated 10 out of 16 participants had improved health, 3 had no change, 1 had worse health, and 2 reported marginal changes. Significant elevation in SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and Spike protein-specific IgG were observed 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. No changes in reactivities were observed against herpes viruses and self-antigens. Within this dataset, higher baseline sIL-6R was associated with symptom improvement, and the two top features associated with non-improvement were high IFN-{beta} and CNTF, among soluble analytes. ConclusionsOur study showed that in this small sample, vaccination improved the health or resulted in no change to the health of most participants, though few experienced worsening. Vaccination was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific IgG and T cell expansion in most individuals with Long COVID. Symptom improvement was observed in those with baseline elevated sIL-6R, while elevated interferon and neuropeptide levels were associated with a lack of improvement. Plain language summaryThe impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on vaccine-naive individuals suffering from Long COVID is uncertain. This study assessed the experience and immune signatures of 16 unvaccinated participants with Long COVID. A total of 10 participants had improved health status after vaccination, and one person reported only worsening health. As expected, vaccination increased immune cells and antibodies against the viral spike protein. Immune signatures may prove to be predictors of health status after vaccination. However, given the small number of participants, these initial findings need further validation.\nMonitoring Report: Respiratory Viruses - December 2023 Data\nAuthors: Gratzl, S.; Cartwright, B. M. G.; Rodriguez, P. J.; Baker, C.; Stucky, N.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301528\nBackground: Few sources regularly monitor hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses. This study provides current hospitalization trends associated with six common respiratory viruses: COVID-19, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. Objective: This study aims to supplement the surveillance data provided by the CDC by describing trends overall and for each respiratory virus. This study also provides valuable insight into two at-risk populations: infants and children (age 0-4) and older adults (age 65 and over). Methods: Using a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the USA consortium of US healthcare systems, we identified people who were hospitalized between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. We identified people who tested positive for any of the six respiratory virus within 14 days of the hospitalization. We report weekly trends in the rate of hospitalizations associated with each virus per all hospitalizations for the overall population and the two high-risk sub populations, infants and children and older adults. Results: We included 502,484 hospitalizations of 471,401 unique patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. Overall, the rate of hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses continue to increase through the end of December 2023 (92.8% increase since November 2023). The largest increases over the past month have been seen in influenza- (251.7% increase), HMPV- (115.0% increase), and COVID-associated (88.6% increase) hospitalizations. For infants and children, RSV accounted for the most respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations, despite decreases throughout December 2023. In this population, COVID-associated hospitalizations had the biggest increase in the last month. For the older adult population, respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations increased to 10.3% per all hospitalizations. COVID remained the largest contributor; 5.3% of all hospitalizations were associated with COVID in the older adult population. Discussion: Respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations continued to increase overall, including for the two high risk populations we studied. RSV-associated hospitalizations continue to be the main contributor to illness in infants and children, while COVID-associated hospitalizations are the largest contributor for the older adult population. We will continue to monitor trends in all respiratory viruses.\nRoutes of importation and spatial dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants during localised interventions in Chile\nAuthors: Gutierrez, B.; Tsui, J. L.- H.; Pullano, G.; Mazzoli, M.; Gangavarapu, K.; Inward, R.; Bajaj, S.; Evans Pena, R.; Busch Moreno, S.; Suchard, M. A.; Pybus, O. G.; Dunner, A.; Puentes, R.; Ayala, S.; Fernandez, J.; Araos, R.; Ferres, L.; Colizza, V.; Kraemer, M. U. G.\nScore: 21.3, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301504\nSouth America suffered large SARS-CoV-2 epidemics between 2020 and 2022 caused by multiple variants of interest and concern, some causing substantial morbidity and mortality. However, their transmission dynamics are poorly characterised. The epidemic situation in Chile enables us to investigate differences in the distribution and spread of variants Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Delta. Chile implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and an integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance system that included airport and community surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we combine viral genomic data and anonymised human mobility data from mobile phones to characterise the routes of importation of different variants into Chile, the relative contributions of airport-based importations to viral diversity versus land border crossings and test the impact of the mobility network on the diffusion of viral lineages within the country. We find that Alpha, Lambda and Mu were identified in Chile via airport surveillance six, four and five weeks ahead of their detection via community surveillance, respectively. Further, some variants that originated in South America were imported into Chile via land rather than international air travel, most notably Gamma. Different variants exhibited similar trends of viral dissemination throughout the country following their importation, and we show that the mobility network predicts the time of arrival of imported lineages to different Chilean comunas. Higher stringency of local NPIs was also associated with fewer domestic viral importations. Our results show how genomic surveillance combined with high resolution mobility data can help predict the multi-scale geographic expansion of emerging infectious diseases.\nStrategic vaccine stockpiles for regional epidemics of emerging viruses: a geospatial modeling framework\nAuthors: Carlson, C. J.; Garnier, R.; Tiu, A. J.; Luby, S. P.; Bansal, S.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.19.24301505\nMultinational epidemics of emerging infectious diseases are increasingly common, due to anthropogenic pressure on ecosystems and the growing connectivity of human populations. Early and efficient vaccination can contain outbreaks and prevent mass mortality, but optimal vaccine stockpiling strategies are dependent on pathogen characteristics, reservoir ecology, and epidemic dynamics. Here, we model major regional outbreaks of Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and use these to develop a generalized framework for estimating vaccine stockpile needs based on spillover geography, spatially-heterogeneous healthcare capacity and spatially-distributed human mobility networks. Because outbreak sizes were highly skewed, we found that most outbreaks were readily contained (median stockpile estimate for MERS-CoV: 2,089 doses; Nipah: 1,882 doses), but the maximum estimated stockpile need in a highly unlikely large outbreak scenario was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher (MERS-CoV: [~]87,000 doses; Nipah [~]1.1 million doses). Sensitivity analysis revealed that stockpile needs were more dependent on basic epidemiological parameters (i.e., death and recovery rate) and healthcare availability than any uncertainty related to vaccine efficacy or deployment strategy. Our results highlight the value of descriptive epidemiology for real-world modeling applications, and suggest that stockpile allocation should consider ecological, epidemiological, and social dimensions of risk.\nTransient anti-interferon autoantibodies in the airways are associated with efficient recovery from COVID-19\nAuthors: Babcock, B. R.; Kosters, A.; Eddins, D. J.; Donaire, M. S. B.; Sarvadhavabhatla, S.; Pae, V.; Beltran, F.; Murray, V. W.; Gill, G.; Xie, G.; Dobosh, B. S.; Giacalone, V. D.; Tirouvanziam, R. M.; Ramonell, R. P.; Jenks, S. A.; Sanz, I.; Lee, F. E.-H.; Roan, N. R.; Lee, S. A.; Ghosn, E. E. B.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301000\nPre-existing anti-interferon alpha (anti-IFN-) autoantibodies in blood are associated with susceptibility to life-threatening COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether anti-IFN- autoantibodies in the airways - the initial site of infection - can also determine disease outcomes. In this study, we developed a new multiparameter technology, flowBEAT, to quantify and profile the isotypes of anti-IFN- and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in longitudinal samples collected over 20 months from the airway and matching blood of 129 donors with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. We found unexpectedly that nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies were induced post-infection onset in more than 70% of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases and associated with robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, fewer symptoms, and efficient recovery. Nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies followed the peak of host IFN- production and waned with disease recovery, revealing a regulated balance between IFN- and anti-IFN- response. Notably, only a subset of mild to moderate patients progressed to develop systemic anti-IFN-, which correlated with systemic inflammation and worsened symptoms. In contrast, patients with life-threatening COVID-19 sustained elevated anti-IFN- in both airways and blood, coupled with uncontrolled viral load and IFN- production. Our studies thereby reveal a novel protective role for nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and, more broadly, suggest that anti-IFN- may serve an important regulatory function to restore homeostasis following viral invasion of the respiratory mucosa.\nRisk Factors for Pediatric Critical COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Aparicio, C.; Willis, Z. I.; Nakamura, M. M.; Wolf, J.; Little, C.; Maron, G. M.; Sue, P. K.; Anosike, B. I.; Miller, C.; Bio, L. L.; Singh, P.; James, S. H.; Oliveira, C. R.; PIDS Pediatric COVID-19 Therapies Task Force, Score: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301452\nBackgroundRisk stratification is a cornerstone of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society COVID-19 treatment guidance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the clinical characteristics and comorbidities associated with critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents. MethodsTwo independent reviewers screened the literature (Medline and EMBASE) for studies published through August 2023 that reported outcome data on patients aged [\u0026le;]21 years with COVID-19. Critical disease was defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses. ResultsAmong 10,178 articles, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Data from 70 studies, which collectively examined 172,165 children and adolescents with COVID-19, were pooled for meta-analysis. In previously healthy children, the absolute risk of critical disease from COVID-19 was 4% (95% CI, 1%-10%). Compared with no comorbidities, the pooled OR for critical disease was 3.95 (95% CI, 2.78-5.63) for presence of one comorbidity and 9.51 (95% CI, 5.62-16.06) for [\u0026ge;]2 comorbidities. Key risk factors included cardiovascular and neurological disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions (excluding asthma), diabetes, obesity, and immunocompromise, all with statistically significant ORs \u003e2.00. ConclusionsWhile the absolute risk for critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents without underlying health conditions is relatively low, the presence of one or more comorbidities was associated with markedly increased risk. These findings support the importance of risk stratification in tailoring pediatric COVID-19 management. SummaryThis systematic review with meta-analysis integrated data from 136 studies (172,165 patients) and identified diabetes; obesity; immunocompromise; and cardiovascular, neurological, and pulmonary disease as predictors of severe pediatric COVID-19. The presence of multiple comorbidities increases the risk of critical outcomes.\nAntiviral efficacy of fluoxetine in early symptomatic COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV)\nAuthors: Jittamala, P.; Boyd, S.; Schilling, W.

P.; Teixeira, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301337\nBackgroundThe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and fluvoxamine were repurposed for the treatment of early COVID-19 based on their antiviral activity in vitro, and observational and clinical trial evidence suggesting they prevented progression to severe disease. However, these SSRIs have not been recommended in guidelines and their antiviral activity in vivo has not been characterised. MethodsPLATCOV is an open-label, multicentre, phase 2, randomised, controlled, adaptive pharmacometric platform trial running in Thailand, Brazil, Pakistan, and Laos. We recruited low-risk adult outpatients aged 18-50 with early symptomatic COVID-19 (symptoms \u003c4 days). Patients were assigned using block randomisation to one of eleven treatment arms including oral fluoxetine (40mg/day for 7 days), or no study drug. Uniform randomisation ratios were applied across the active treatment groups while the no study drug group comprised [\u0026ge;]20% of patients at all times. The primary endpoint was the rate of oropharyngeal viral clearance assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population (\u003e2 days follow-up). The viral clearance rate was estimated under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to the log10 viral densities in standardised duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates taken daily over one week (18 measurements per patient). This ongoing trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05041907). FindingsBetween 5 April 2022 and 8 May 2023 271 patients were concurrently randomised to either fluoxetine (n=120) or no study drug (n=151). Fluoxetine was well tolerated and accelerated the rate of viral clearance relative to the no study drug arm by 15% (95% credible interval (CrI): 2% to 34%). In a pooled meta-analysis including all unblinded patients the antiviral activity of fluoxetine was substantially less than ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir-85% increase in rate of viral clearance (95% CrI: 61 to 112%); and less than remdesivir 35% (14 to 59%), molnupiravir 37% (18 to 60%), and casirivimab/imdevimab 29% (10 to 48%). InterpretationFluoxetine has in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Although the level of antiviral efficacy is substantially less than with other currently available antiviral drugs, fluoxetine might still be useful in prophylaxis where less antiviral effect is required.

Evidence before this studyThe SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been proposed as COVID-19 therapeutics based initially on observational, randomised trial and in vitro evidence. The observational reports suggested that patients taking SSRIs had a reduced probability of developing severe COVID-19 and dying. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies in English up until the 30th November 2023 using the search terms \"fluoxetine\", \"fluvoxamine\" and \"COVID-19\" with the search restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Eight outpatient fluvoxamine RCTs were identified. There were no fluoxetine RCTs in outpatients. A meta-analysis of available RCTs is compatible with a moderate reduction in hospitalisation and death in COVID-19 patients with an estimated risk ratio of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62,1.01). Added value of the studyWe showed that in early COVID-19 illness the SSRI fluoxetine has weak antiviral activity in vivo. This activity is substantially less than other available antivirals such as ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir. The pharmacometric approach described here provides a quantitative measure of in vivo antiviral effects with tractable sample sizes. Implications of available evidenceFluoxetine has weak in vivo antiviral activity in early COVID-19. This is insufficient for treatment but, as less antiviral activity is required to prevent an infection, fluoxetine could still be beneficial in prophylaxis.\nJAK/STAT Signaling Predominates in Human and Murine Fungal Post-infectious Inflammatory Response Syndrome\nAuthors: Hargarten, J. C.; Ssebambulidde, K.; Anjum, S. H.; Vaughan, M. J.; Xu, J.; Song, B.; Ganguly, A.; Park, Y.-D.; Scott, T. L.; Hammoud, D. A.; Olszewski, M. A.; Williamson, P. R.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301483\nPost-infection inflammatory syndromes have been increasingly recognized as a cause of host damage in a variety of infectious diseases including tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis, and COVID-19. Recently, a post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome (PIIRS) was described in non-HIV-infected cryptococcal fungal meningoencephalitis (CM) as a major cause of mortality. Inflammatory syndromes are particularly severe in neurological infections due to the skulls rigid structure which limits unchecked tissue expansion from inflammatory-induced edema. In the present studies, neurologic transcriptional pathway analysis utilizing a murine PIIRS model demonstrated a predominance of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) activation. JAK/STAT inhibitor treatment resulted in improvements in CNS damage markers, reductions in intrathecal CD44hiCD62lo CD4+ effector CD4+ T-cells and MHC II+ inflammatory myeloid cells, and weight gains in mice, the latter after treatment with antifungals. Based on these data, pathway-driven steroid-sparing human treatment for steroid-refractory PIIRS was initiated using short courses of the JAK/STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib. These were well tolerated and reduced activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ cells and inflammatory monocytes as well as improved brain imaging. Together, these findings support the role of JAK/STAT in PIIRS as well as further study of JAK/STAT inhibitors as potential adjunctive therapy for PIRS and other neural inflammatory syndromes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">With an estimated 65 million individuals suffering from Long COVID, validated therapeutic strategies as well as non-invasive biomarkers are direly needed to guide clinical management. We used blood digital transcriptomics in search of viral persistence and Long COVID diagnostic biomarkers in a real-world, general practice-based setting with a long clinical follow-up. We demonstrate systemic SARS-CoV-2 persistence for more than 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection. A 2-gene biomarker, including FYN and SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA, correctly classifies Long COVID with 93.8% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity. Specific immune transcripts and immunometabolism score correlate to systemic viral load and patient-reported anxiety/depression, providing mechanistic links as well as therapeutic targets to tackle Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Repeated mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been associated with increases in the proportion of IgG4 in spike-specific antibody responses and concurrent reductions in Fc{gamma}-mediated effector functions that may limit control of viral infection. Here, we assessed anti-Spike total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and surrogate markers for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, Fc{gamma}RIIa binding), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Fc{gamma}RIIIa binding), and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD, C1q binding) associated with repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The NVX-CoV2373 protein vaccine did not induce notable increases in spike-specific IgG4 or negatively impact surrogates for Fc{gamma} effector responses. Conversely, repeated NVX-CoV2373 vaccination uniquely enhanced IgG3 responses which are known to exhibit strong affinity for Fc{gamma}RIIIa and have previously been linked to potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent investigations will help to understand the immunological diversity generated by different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types and have the potential to reshape public health strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID contributes to the global burden of disease. Proposed root cause hypotheses include the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoir, autoimmunity, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Patients have reported various changes in Long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccinations, leaving uncertainty about whether vaccine-induced immune responses may alleviate or worsen disease pathology.

MethodsIn this prospective study, we evaluated changes in symptoms and immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in 16 vaccine-naive individuals with Long COVID. Surveys were administered before vaccination and then at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose of the primary series. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR enrichment, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, antibody responses to other viral and self-antigens, and circulating cytokines were quantified before vaccination and at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination.

ResultsSelf-report at 12 weeks post-vaccination indicated 10 out of 16 participants had improved health, 3 had no change, 1 had worse health, and 2 reported marginal changes. Significant elevation in SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and Spike protein-specific IgG were observed 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. No changes in reactivities were observed against herpes viruses and self-antigens. Within this dataset, higher baseline sIL-6R was associated with symptom improvement, and the two top features associated with non-improvement were high IFN-{beta} and CNTF, among soluble analytes.

ConclusionsOur study showed that in this small sample, vaccination improved the health or resulted in no change to the health of most participants, though few experienced worsening. Vaccination was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific IgG and T cell expansion in most individuals with Long COVID. Symptom improvement was observed in those with baseline elevated sIL-6R, while elevated interferon and neuropeptide levels were associated with a lack of improvement.

Plain language summaryThe impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on vaccine-naive individuals suffering from Long COVID is uncertain. This study assessed the experience and immune signatures of 16 unvaccinated participants with Long COVID. A total of 10 participants had improved health status after vaccination, and one person reported only worsening health. As expected, vaccination increased immune cells and antibodies against the viral spike protein. Immune signatures may prove to be predictors of health status after vaccination. However, given the small number of participants, these initial findings need further validation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Few sources regularly monitor hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses. This study provides current hospitalization trends associated with six common respiratory viruses: COVID-19, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. Objective: This study aims to supplement the surveillance data provided by the CDC by describing trends overall and for each respiratory virus. This study also provides valuable insight into two at-risk populations: infants and children (age 0-4) and older adults (age 65 and over). Methods: Using a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the USA consortium of US healthcare systems, we identified people who were hospitalized between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. We identified people who tested positive for any of the six respiratory virus within 14 days of the hospitalization. We report weekly trends in the rate of hospitalizations associated with each virus per all hospitalizations for the overall population and the two high-risk sub populations, infants and children and older adults. Results: We included 502,484 hospitalizations of 471,401 unique patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus between October 01, 2019 and December 31, 2023. Overall, the rate of hospitalizations associated with respiratory viruses continue to increase through the end of December 2023 (92.8% increase since November 2023). The largest increases over the past month have been seen in influenza- (251.7% increase), HMPV- (115.0% increase), and COVID-associated (88.6% increase) hospitalizations. For infants and children, RSV accounted for the most respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations, despite decreases throughout December 2023. In this population, COVID-associated hospitalizations had the biggest increase in the last month. For the older adult population, respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations increased to 10.3% per all hospitalizations. COVID remained the largest contributor; 5.3% of all hospitalizations were associated with COVID in the older adult population. Discussion: Respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations continued to increase overall, including for the two high risk populations we studied. RSV-associated hospitalizations continue to be the main contributor to illness in infants and children, while COVID-associated hospitalizations are the largest contributor for the older adult population. We will continue to monitor trends in all respiratory viruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">South America suffered large SARS-CoV-2 epidemics between 2020 and 2022 caused by multiple variants of interest and concern, some causing substantial morbidity and mortality. However, their transmission dynamics are poorly characterised. The epidemic situation in Chile enables us to investigate differences in the distribution and spread of variants Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Delta. Chile implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and an integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance system that included airport and community surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we combine viral genomic data and anonymised human mobility data from mobile phones to characterise the routes of importation of different variants into Chile, the relative contributions of airport-based importations to viral diversity versus land border crossings and test the impact of the mobility network on the diffusion of viral lineages within the country. We find that Alpha, Lambda and Mu were identified in Chile via airport surveillance six, four and five weeks ahead of their detection via community surveillance, respectively. Further, some variants that originated in South America were imported into Chile via land rather than international air travel, most notably Gamma. Different variants exhibited similar trends of viral dissemination throughout the country following their importation, and we show that the mobility network predicts the time of arrival of imported lineages to different Chilean comunas. Higher stringency of local NPIs was also associated with fewer domestic viral importations. Our results show how genomic surveillance combined with high resolution mobility data can help predict the multi-scale geographic expansion of emerging infectious diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multinational epidemics of emerging infectious diseases are increasingly common, due to anthropogenic pressure on ecosystems and the growing connectivity of human populations. Early and efficient vaccination can contain outbreaks and prevent mass mortality, but optimal vaccine stockpiling strategies are dependent on pathogen characteristics, reservoir ecology, and epidemic dynamics. Here, we model major regional outbreaks of Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and use these to develop a generalized framework for estimating vaccine stockpile needs based on spillover geography, spatially-heterogeneous healthcare capacity and spatially-distributed human mobility networks. Because outbreak sizes were highly skewed, we found that most outbreaks were readily contained (median stockpile estimate for MERS-CoV: 2,089 doses; Nipah: 1,882 doses), but the maximum estimated stockpile need in a highly unlikely large outbreak scenario was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher (MERS-CoV: [~]87,000 doses; Nipah [~]1.1 million doses). Sensitivity analysis revealed that stockpile needs were more dependent on basic epidemiological parameters (i.e., death and recovery rate) and healthcare availability than any uncertainty related to vaccine efficacy or deployment strategy. Our results highlight the value of descriptive epidemiology for real-world modeling applications, and suggest that stockpile allocation should consider ecological, epidemiological, and social dimensions of risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pre-existing anti-interferon alpha (anti-IFN-) autoantibodies in blood are associated with susceptibility to life-threatening COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether anti-IFN- autoantibodies in the airways - the initial site of infection - can also determine disease outcomes. In this study, we developed a new multiparameter technology, flowBEAT, to quantify and profile the isotypes of anti-IFN- and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in longitudinal samples collected over 20 months from the airway and matching blood of 129 donors with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. We found unexpectedly that nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies were induced post-infection onset in more than 70% of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases and associated with robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, fewer symptoms, and efficient recovery. Nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies followed the peak of host IFN- production and waned with disease recovery, revealing a regulated balance between IFN- and anti-IFN- response. Notably, only a subset of mild to moderate patients progressed to develop systemic anti-IFN-, which correlated with systemic inflammation and worsened symptoms. In contrast, patients with life-threatening COVID-19 sustained elevated anti-IFN- in both airways and blood, coupled with uncontrolled viral load and IFN- production. Our studies thereby reveal a novel protective role for nasal anti-IFN- autoantibodies in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and, more broadly, suggest that anti-IFN- may serve an important regulatory function to restore homeostasis following viral invasion of the respiratory mucosa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRisk stratification is a cornerstone of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society COVID-19 treatment guidance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the clinical characteristics and comorbidities associated with critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents.

MethodsTwo independent reviewers screened the literature (Medline and EMBASE) for studies published through August 2023 that reported outcome data on patients aged [&amp;le;]21 years with COVID-19. Critical disease was defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses.

ResultsAmong 10,178 articles, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Data from 70 studies, which collectively examined 172,165 children and adolescents with COVID-19, were pooled for meta-analysis. In previously healthy children, the absolute risk of critical disease from COVID-19 was 4% (95% CI, 1%-10%). Compared with no comorbidities, the pooled OR for critical disease was 3.95 (95% CI, 2.78-5.63) for presence of one comorbidity and 9.51 (95% CI, 5.62-16.06) for [&amp;ge;]2 comorbidities. Key risk factors included cardiovascular and neurological disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions (excluding asthma), diabetes, obesity, and immunocompromise, all with statistically significant ORs &gt;2.00.

ConclusionsWhile the absolute risk for critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents without underlying health conditions is relatively low, the presence of one or more comorbidities was associated with markedly increased risk. These findings support the importance of risk stratification in tailoring pediatric COVID-19 management.

SummaryThis systematic review with meta-analysis integrated data from 136 studies (172,165 patients) and identified diabetes; obesity; immunocompromise; and cardiovascular, neurological, and pulmonary disease as predictors of severe pediatric COVID-19. The presence of multiple comorbidities increases the risk of critical outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and fluvoxamine were repurposed for the treatment of early COVID-19 based on their antiviral activity in vitro, and observational and clinical trial evidence suggesting they prevented progression to severe disease. However, these SSRIs have not been recommended in guidelines and their antiviral activity in vivo has not been characterised.

MethodsPLATCOV is an open-label, multicentre, phase 2, randomised, controlled, adaptive pharmacometric platform trial running in Thailand, Brazil, Pakistan, and Laos. We recruited low-risk adult outpatients aged 18-50 with early symptomatic COVID-19 (symptoms &lt;4 days). Patients were assigned using block randomisation to one of eleven treatment arms including oral fluoxetine (40mg/day for 7 days), or no study drug. Uniform randomisation ratios were applied across the active treatment groups while the no study drug group comprised [&amp;ge;]20% of patients at all times.

The primary endpoint was the rate of oropharyngeal viral clearance assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population (&gt;2 days follow-up). The viral clearance rate was estimated under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to the log10 viral densities in standardised duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates taken daily over one week (18 measurements per patient). This ongoing trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05041907).

FindingsBetween 5 April 2022 and 8 May 2023 271 patients were concurrently randomised to either fluoxetine (n=120) or no study drug (n=151). Fluoxetine was well tolerated and accelerated the rate of viral clearance relative to the no study drug arm by 15% (95% credible interval (CrI): 2% to 34%). In a pooled meta-analysis including all unblinded patients the antiviral activity of fluoxetine was substantially less than ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir-85% increase in rate of viral clearance (95% CrI: 61 to 112%); and less than remdesivir 35% (14 to 59%), molnupiravir 37% (18 to 60%), and casirivimab/imdevimab 29% (10 to 48%).

InterpretationFluoxetine has in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Although the level of antiviral efficacy is substantially less than with other currently available antiviral drugs, fluoxetine might still be useful in prophylaxis where less antiviral effect is required.

Evidence before this studyThe SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been proposed as COVID-19 therapeutics based initially on observational, randomised trial and in vitro evidence. The observational reports suggested that patients taking SSRIs had a reduced probability of developing severe COVID-19 and dying. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies in English up until the 30th November 2023 using the search terms &#34;fluoxetine&#34;, &#34;fluvoxamine&#34; and &#34;COVID-19&#34; with the search restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Eight outpatient fluvoxamine RCTs were identified. There were no fluoxetine RCTs in outpatients. A meta-analysis of available RCTs is compatible with a moderate reduction in hospitalisation and death in COVID-19 patients with an estimated risk ratio of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62,1.01).

Added value of the studyWe showed that in early COVID-19 illness the SSRI fluoxetine has weak antiviral activity in vivo. This activity is substantially less than other available antivirals such as ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir. The pharmacometric approach described here provides a quantitative measure of in vivo antiviral effects with tractable sample sizes.

Implications of available evidenceFluoxetine has weak in vivo antiviral activity in early COVID-19. This is insufficient for treatment but, as less antiviral activity is required to prevent an infection, fluoxetine could still be beneficial in prophylaxis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-infection inflammatory syndromes have been increasingly recognized as a cause of host damage in a variety of infectious diseases including tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis, and COVID-19. Recently, a post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome (PIIRS) was described in non-HIV-infected cryptococcal fungal meningoencephalitis (CM) as a major cause of mortality. Inflammatory syndromes are particularly severe in neurological infections due to the skulls rigid structure which limits unchecked tissue expansion from inflammatory-induced edema. In the present studies, neurologic transcriptional pathway analysis utilizing a murine PIIRS model demonstrated a predominance of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) activation. JAK/STAT inhibitor treatment resulted in improvements in CNS damage markers, reductions in intrathecal CD44hiCD62lo CD4&#43; effector CD4&#43; T-cells and MHC II&#43; inflammatory myeloid cells, and weight gains in mice, the latter after treatment with antifungals. Based on these data, pathway-driven steroid-sparing human treatment for steroid-refractory PIIRS was initiated using short courses of the JAK/STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib. These were well tolerated and reduced activated HLA-DR&#43; CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; cells and inflammatory monocytes as well as improved brain imaging. Together, these findings support the role of JAK/STAT in PIIRS as well as further study of JAK/STAT inhibitors as potential adjunctive therapy for PIRS and other neural inflammatory syndromes.</p>
