J.\nScore: 168.7, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23288598\nObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound. DesignObservational cohort study. SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts. ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy. Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [\u0026ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to \u003c4.0 log10 copies/milliliter. ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [\u0026ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene. Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.\nEarly oral switch in low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection\nAuthors: Kaasch, A. J.; Lopez-Cortes, L. E.; Rodriguez-Bano, J.; Cisneros, J. M.; Navarro, D.; Faetkenheuer, G.; Jung, N.; Rieg, S.; Lepeule, R.; Coutte, L.; Bernard, L.; Lemaignen, A.; Koesters, K.; MacKenzie, C. R.; Soriano, A.; Hagel, S.; Fantin, B.; Lafaurie, M.; Talarmin, J.-P.; Dinh, A.; Guimard, T.; Boutoille, D.; Welte, T.; Reuter, S.; Kluytmans, J.; Martin, M. L.; Forestier, E.; Stocker, H.; Vitrat, V.; Tattevin, P.; Rommerskirchen, A.; Noret, M.; Adams, A.; Kern, W. V.; Hellmich, M.; Seifert, H.; SABATO group, Score: 85.3, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23291932\nBackgroundStaphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is treated with at least 14 days of intravenously administered antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early oral switch therapy in patients at low risk for SAB-related complications. MethodsIn an international non-inferiority trial, we randomized patients with SAB after 5 to 7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to either switch to an oral antimicrobial or to continue with intravenous standard therapy. Main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated SAB, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. Composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any SAB-related complication (relapsing SAB, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to SAB) within 90 days. Results213 patients were randomized into the intention-to-treat population. In the oral switch group, 14/108 (13%) participants reached the primary endpoint versus 13/105 (12%) in the standard therapy group (adjusted difference 0.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.8% to 9.1%). Participants in the oral switch group were discharged earlier (median hospital stay from SAB onset of 12 days versus 16 days; adjusted difference -3.1 days [95% CI -7.5 to 1.4]). There was no statistical difference in 30-day survival and complications of intravenous administration. More participants in the oral group experienced at least one serious adverse event (34% versus 26%, p=0.292). ConclusionOral switch was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk SAB. However, a careful assessment of patients for signs and symptoms of complicated SAB at time of presentation and thereafter is necessary before considering early oral switch therapy. The trial was registered as NCT01792804 in ClinicalTrials.gov, as DRKS00004741 in the German Clinical trials register, and as EudraCT 2013-000577-77.\nIncreased circulating fibronectin, depletion of natural IgM and heightened EBV, HSV-1 reactivation in ME/CFS and long COVID\nAuthors: Liu, Z.; Hollmann, C.; Kalanidhi, S.; Grothey, A.; Keating, S.; Mena-Palomo, I.; Lamer, S.; Schlosser, A.; Kaiping, A.; Scheller, C.; Sotzny, F.; Horn, A.; Nuernberger, C.; Cejka, V.; Afshar, B.; Bahmer, T.; Schreiber, S.; Janne Vehreschild, J.; Milljukov, O.; Schaefer, C.; Kretzler, L.; Keil, T.; Reese, J.-P.; Eichner, F. A.; Schmidbauer, L.; Heuschmann, P. U.; Stoerk, S.; Morbach, C.; Riemekasten, G.; Beyersdorf, N.; Scheibenbogen, C.; Naviaux, R. K.; Williams, M.; Ariza, M. E.; Prusty, B. K.\nScore: 462.6, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291827\nMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.\nHealthy adults possess cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition antibodies to an A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b avian influenza virus A/Black Faced Spoonbill/Hong Kong/AFCD-HKU-22-21429-01012/2022\nAuthors: Daulagala, P.; Cheng, S. M. S.; Chin, A. W. H.; Luk, L. L. H.; Leung, K.; Wu, J. T.; Poon, L. L. M.; Peiris, J. S. M.; Yen, H.-L.\nScore: 49.2, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291839\nHemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodies to a clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus were measured in 63 age-stratified healthy adults in Hong Kong. No HI antibody was detected; 61 subjects had detectable NI antibodies to A(H5N1). NI titers to A(H5N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were correlated.\nRisk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during multiple Omicron variant waves in the UK general population\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Stoesser, N.; Matthews, P.; Khera, T.; Gethings, O.; Diamond, I.; Studley, R.; Taylor, N.; peto, t. E.; Walker, A. S.; Pouwels, K.; Eyre, D. W.\nScore: 45.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292043\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [\u0026ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally \u003e1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those \u003e180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.\nRisk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Those Up-to-Date and Not Up-to-Date on COVID-19 Vaccination\nAuthors: Shrestha, N. K.; Burke, P. C.; Nowacki, A. S.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 5168.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23290893\nBackgroundThe CDC recently defined being \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the \"up-to-date\" and \"not up-to-date\" states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the \"not up-to-date\" than in the \"up-to-date\" state. On multivariable analysis, not being \"up-to-date\" with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, \u003c0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered \"up-to-date\" after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine. ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults \"not up-to-date\" by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition. SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not \"up-to-date\" on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those \"up-to-date\". The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.\nA new Omicron lineage with Spike Y451H mutation that dominated a new COVID-19 wave in Kilifi, Coastal Kenya: March-May 2023\nAuthors: Mwanga, M. J.; LAMBISIA, A. W.; Morobe, J. M.; Murunga, N.; Moraa, E.; Ndwiga, L.; Robinson, C.; Mutunga, M.; Guzman Rincon, L. M.; Sande, C.; Mwangangi, J.; Bejon, P.; Ochola-Oyier, l. I.; Nokes, J.; Agoti, C. N.; Nyiro, J.; Githinji, G.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292158\nWe report a newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage, named FY.4, that has two unique mutations; spike:Y451H and ORF3a:P42L. FY.4 emergence has coincided with increased SARS-CoV-2 cases in coastal Kenya, April-May 2023. We demonstrate the value of continued SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in the post-acute pandemic era in understanding new COVID-19 outbreaks.\nIdentification of a molnupiravir-associated mutational signature in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.; Hisner, R.; Donovan-Banfield, I.; Hartman, H.; Lochen, A.; Peacock, T.; Ruis, C.\nScore: 2266.6, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.26.23284998\nMolnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load 2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm the association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.\nAttitudes to phage therapy among Australian infectious diseases physicians\nAuthors: Plymoth, M.; Lynch, S. A.; Khatami, A. K.; Sinclair, H. A.; Sacher, J. C.; Zheng, J.; Lin, R. C.; Iredell, J. R.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292153\nDue to the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there has been an increased interest in phage therapy to treat multi-drug resistant infections. In Australia, phage therapy is predominantly used in small clinical studies or for compassionate use, however, despite its potential expansion in modern medicine, the perception of phage therapy among medical professionals remains largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted a national survey of Australian infectious diseases and clinical microbiology advanced trainees and specialists to assess their knowledge, areas of interest, and concerns around the use of phage therapy in clinical practice in Australia. Our survey received 92 responses from infectious diseases and clinical microbiology professionals across all states of Australia. The majority of those surveyed believed that the current national plan for controlling AMR is inadequate and that phage therapy may be an effective solution; with 97% of respondents indicating that they would consider using phage therapy meeting established guidelines for purity and safety (United States Food and Drug Administration and/or European Union guidelines). The respondents indicated a preference for bespoke therapy, with Gram-negative pathogens highlighted as priority targets. Alongside the phage therapy delivery protocols, therapeutic phage monitoring (TPM; like therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)) was considered important. Cystic Fibrosis, lung-infections, prosthetic device related infections, and infections among patients following transplantation and/or immunosuppression were highly ranked in terms of priorities for clinical syndromes. Accessibility was highlighted as a barrier to phage therapy, specifically timely access (72%) and logistics of phage procurement and administration (70%). Altogether, these results suggest the support of phage therapy among infectious diseases and clinical microbiology advanced trainees and specialists in Australia, and highlights areas of focus and priority in order to advance phage therapy in modern medicine.\nYellow fever disease severity and endothelial dysfunction are associated with elevated serum levels of viral NS1 protein and syndecan-1\nAuthors: Tramontini Gomes de Sousa, F.; Warnes, C.; Manuli, E. R.; Ng, A.; G. F. A. B. D Elia Zanella, L.; Ho, Y.-L.; Bhat, S.; Romano, C. M.; Beatty, P. R.; Biering, S. B.; Kallas, E. G.; Sabino, E. C.; Harris, E.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292053\nYellow fever virus (YFV) infections can cause severe disease manifestations, including hepatic injury, endothelial damage, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, systemic organ failure, and shock, and are associated with high mortality in humans. While nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the related dengue virus is implicated in contributing to vascular leak, little is known about the role of YFV NS1 in severe YF and mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in YFV infections. Here, using serum samples from qRT-PCR-confirmed YF patients with severe (n=39) or non-severe (n=18) disease in a well-defined hospital cohort in Brazil, plus samples from healthy uninfected controls (n=11), we investigated factors associated with disease severity. We developed a quantitative YFV NS1 capture ELISA and found significantly increased levels of NS1, as well as syndecan-1, a marker of vascular leak, in serum from severe YF as compared to non-severe YF or control groups. We also showed that hyperpermeability of endothelial cell monolayers treated with serum from severe YF patients was significantly higher compared to non-severe YF and control groups as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Further, we demonstrated that YFV NS1 induces shedding of syndecan-1 from the surface of human endothelial cells. Notably, YFV NS1 serum levels significantly correlated with syndecan-1 serum levels and TEER values. Syndecan-1 levels also significantly correlated with clinical laboratory parameters of disease severity, viral load, hospitalization, and death. In summary, this study points to a role for secreted NS1 in YF disease severity and provides evidence for endothelial dysfunction as a mechanism of YF pathogenesis in humans. SignificanceYellow fever virus (YFV) infections cause a major global disease burden, and as such it is critical to identify clinical correlates of disease severity. Using clinical samples from our hospital cohort in Brazil, we show that YF disease severity is associated with increased serum levels of the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and soluble syndecan-1, a marker of vascular leak. This study extends the role of YFV NS1 in triggering endothelial dysfunction to human YF patients, previously demonstrated in vitro and in mouse models. Further, we developed a YFV NS1-capture ELISA that serves as a proof-of-concept for low-cost NS1-based diagnosis/prognosis tools for YF. Together, our data shows that YFV NS1 and endothelial dysfunction are important components of YF pathogenesis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo compare the frequency of replication-competent virologic rebound with and without nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute COVID-19. Secondary aims were to estimate the validity of symptoms to detect rebound and the incidence of emergent nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations after rebound.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingMulticenter healthcare system in Boston, Massachusetts.

ParticipantsWe enrolled ambulatory adults with a positive COVID-19 test and/or a prescription for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

ExposuresReceipt of 5 days of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy.

Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 virologic rebound, defined as either (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture following a prior negative culture or (2) two consecutive viral loads [&amp;ge;]4.0 log10 copies/milliliter after a prior reduction in viral load to &lt;4.0 log10 copies/milliliter.

ResultsCompared with untreated individuals (n=55), those taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and were more commonly immunosuppressed. Fifteen individuals (20.8%) taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir experienced virologic rebound versus one (1.8%) of the untreated (absolute difference 19.0% [95%CI 9.0-29.0%], P=0.001). In multivariable models, only N-R was associated with VR (AOR 10.02, 95%CI 1.13-88.74). VR occurred more commonly among those with earlier nirmatrelvirritonavir initiation (29.0%, 16.7% and 0% when initiated days 0, 1, and [&amp;ge;]2 after diagnosis, respectively, P=0.089). Among participants on N-R, those experiencing rebound had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared to those that did not rebound (median: 14 vs 3 days). Only 8/16 with virologic rebound reported worsening symptoms (50%, 95%CI 25%-75%); 2 were completely asymptomatic. We detected no post-rebound nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations in the NSP5 protease gene.

Conclusions and RelevanceVirologic rebound occurred in approximately one in five people taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and often occurred without worsening symptoms. Because it is associated with replication-competent viral shedding, close monitoring and potential isolation of those who rebound should be considered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is treated with at least 14 days of intravenously administered antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early oral switch therapy in patients at low risk for SAB-related complications.

MethodsIn an international non-inferiority trial, we randomized patients with SAB after 5 to 7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to either switch to an oral antimicrobial or to continue with intravenous standard therapy. Main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated SAB, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. Composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any SAB-related complication (relapsing SAB, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to SAB) within 90 days.

Results213 patients were randomized into the intention-to-treat population. In the oral switch group, 14/108 (13%) participants reached the primary endpoint versus 13/105 (12%) in the standard therapy group (adjusted difference 0.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.8% to 9.1%). Participants in the oral switch group were discharged earlier (median hospital stay from SAB onset of 12 days versus 16 days; adjusted difference -3.1 days [95% CI -7.5 to 1.4]). There was no statistical difference in 30-day survival and complications of intravenous administration. More participants in the oral group experienced at least one serious adverse event (34% versus 26%, p=0.292).

ConclusionOral switch was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk SAB. However, a careful assessment of patients for signs and symptoms of complicated SAB at time of presentation and thereafter is necessary before considering early oral switch therapy.

The trial was registered as NCT01792804 in ClinicalTrials.gov, as DRKS00004741 in the German Clinical trials register, and as EudraCT 2013-000577-77.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating, long-term illness without a diagnostic biomarker. ME/CFS patients share overlapping symptoms with long COVID patients, an observation which has strengthened the infectious origin hypothesis of ME/CFS. However, the exact sequence of events leading to disease development is largely unknown for both clinical conditions. Here we show antibody response to herpesvirus dUTPases, particularly to that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-1, increased circulating fibronectin (FN1) levels in serum and depletion of natural IgM against fibronectin ((n)IgM-FN1) are common factors for both severe ME/CFS and long COVID. We provide evidence for herpesvirus dUTPases-mediated alterations in host cell cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS. Our data show altered active immune complexes, immunoglobulin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation as well as adaptive IgM production in ME/CFS patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into both ME/CFS and long COVID development. Finding of increased circulating FN1 and depletion of (n)IgM-FN1 as a biomarker for the severity of both ME/CFS and long COVID has an immediate implication in diagnostics and development of treatment modalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults [&amp;ge;]18y in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally &gt;1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those &gt;180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe CDC recently defined being &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination as having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of COVID-19 among those &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine first became available, and still employed when the XBB lineages became dominant, were included.

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 since the XBB lineages became dominant was compared across the &#34;up-to-date&#34; and &#34;not up-to-date&#34; states, by treating COVID-19 bivalent vaccination as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on receipt of the vaccine. Risk of COVID-19 by vaccination status was also compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for propensity to get tested for COVID-19, age, sex, and phase of most recent prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsCOVID-19 occurred in 1475 (3%) of 48 344 employees during the 100-day study period. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was lower in the &#34;not up-to-date&#34; than in the &#34;up-to-date&#34; state. On multivariable analysis, not being &#34;up-to-date&#34; with COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.77; 95% C.I., 0.69-0.86; P-value, &lt;0.001). Results were very similar when those 65 years and older were only considered &#34;up-to-date&#34; after receiving 2 doses of the bivalent vaccine.

ConclusionsSince the XBB lineages became dominant, adults &#34;not up-to-date&#34; by the CDC definition have a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination, bringing into question the value of this risk classification definition.

SummaryAmong 48 344 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, those not &#34;up-to-date&#34; on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19 than those &#34;up-to-date&#34;. The current CDC definition provides a meaningless classification of risk of COVID-19 in the adult population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molnupiravir, an antiviral medication that has been widely used against SARS-CoV-2, acts by inducing mutations in the virus genome during replication. Most random mutations are likely to be deleterious to the virus, and many will be lethal, and so molnupiravir-induced elevated mutation rates reduce viral load 2,3. However, if some patients treated with molnupiravir do not fully clear SARS-CoV-2 infections, there could be the potential for onward transmission of molnupiravir-mutated viruses. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing databases contain extensive evidence of molnupiravir mutagenesis. Using a systematic approach, we find that a specific class of long phylogenetic branches, distinguished by a high proportion of G-to-A and C-to-T mutations, appear almost exclusively in sequences from 2022, after the introduction of molnupiravir treatment, and in countries and age-groups with widespread usage of the drug. We identify a mutational spectrum, with preferred nucleotide contexts, from viruses in patients known to have been treated with molnupiravir and show that its signature matches that seen in these long branches, in some cases with onwards transmission of molnupiravir-derived lineages. Finally, we analyse treatment records to confirm the association between these high G-to-A branches and the use of molnupiravir.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there has been an increased interest in phage therapy to treat multi-drug resistant infections. In Australia, phage therapy is predominantly used in small clinical studies or for compassionate use, however, despite its potential expansion in modern medicine, the perception of phage therapy among medical professionals remains largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted a national survey of Australian infectious diseases and clinical microbiology advanced trainees and specialists to assess their knowledge, areas of interest, and concerns around the use of phage therapy in clinical practice in Australia. Our survey received 92 responses from infectious diseases and clinical microbiology professionals across all states of Australia. The majority of those surveyed believed that the current national plan for controlling AMR is inadequate and that phage therapy may be an effective solution; with 97% of respondents indicating that they would consider using phage therapy meeting established guidelines for purity and safety (United States Food and Drug Administration and/or European Union guidelines). The respondents indicated a preference for bespoke therapy, with Gram-negative pathogens highlighted as priority targets. Alongside the phage therapy delivery protocols, therapeutic phage monitoring (TPM; like therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)) was considered important. Cystic Fibrosis, lung-infections, prosthetic device related infections, and infections among patients following transplantation and/or immunosuppression were highly ranked in terms of priorities for clinical syndromes. Accessibility was highlighted as a barrier to phage therapy, specifically timely access (72%) and logistics of phage procurement and administration (70%). Altogether, these results suggest the support of phage therapy among infectious diseases and clinical microbiology advanced trainees and specialists in Australia, and highlights areas of focus and priority in order to advance phage therapy in modern medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Yellow fever virus (YFV) infections can cause severe disease manifestations, including hepatic injury, endothelial damage, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, systemic organ failure, and shock, and are associated with high mortality in humans. While nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the related dengue virus is implicated in contributing to vascular leak, little is known about the role of YFV NS1 in severe YF and mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in YFV infections. Here, using serum samples from qRT-PCR-confirmed YF patients with severe (n=39) or non-severe (n=18) disease in a well-defined hospital cohort in Brazil, plus samples from healthy uninfected controls (n=11), we investigated factors associated with disease severity. We developed a quantitative YFV NS1 capture ELISA and found significantly increased levels of NS1, as well as syndecan-1, a marker of vascular leak, in serum from severe YF as compared to non-severe YF or control groups. We also showed that hyperpermeability of endothelial cell monolayers treated with serum from severe YF patients was significantly higher compared to non-severe YF and control groups as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Further, we demonstrated that YFV NS1 induces shedding of syndecan-1 from the surface of human endothelial cells. Notably, YFV NS1 serum levels significantly correlated with syndecan-1 serum levels and TEER values. Syndecan-1 levels also significantly correlated with clinical laboratory parameters of disease severity, viral load, hospitalization, and death. In summary, this study points to a role for secreted NS1 in YF disease severity and provides evidence for endothelial dysfunction as a mechanism of YF pathogenesis in humans.

SignificanceYellow fever virus (YFV) infections cause a major global disease burden, and as such it is critical to identify clinical correlates of disease severity. Using clinical samples from our hospital cohort in Brazil, we show that YF disease severity is associated with increased serum levels of the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and soluble syndecan-1, a marker of vascular leak. This study extends the role of YFV NS1 in triggering endothelial dysfunction to human YF patients, previously demonstrated in vitro and in mouse models. Further, we developed a YFV NS1-capture ELISA that serves as a proof-of-concept for low-cost NS1-based diagnosis/prognosis tools for YF. Together, our data shows that YFV NS1 and endothelial dysfunction are important components of YF pathogenesis.</p>
