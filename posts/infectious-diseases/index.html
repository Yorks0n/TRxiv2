G.; Yu, H.\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300299\nUnderstanding how the global dispersal patterns of seasonal influenza viruses were perturbed during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to inform influenza intervention and vaccination strategies in the post-pandemic period. Although global human mobility has been identified as a key driver of influenza dispersal1, alongside climatic and evolutionary factors2,3, the impact of international travel restrictions on global influenza transmission and recovery remains unknown. Here we combine molecular, epidemiological, climatic, and international travel data within a phylodynamic framework to show that, despite human mobility remaining the principal driver of global influenza virus dissemination, the pandemics onset led to a shift in the international population structure and migration network of seasonal influenza lineages. We find that South Asia and Africa played important roles as exporters and phylogenetic trunk locations of influenza in 2020 and 2021, and we highlight the association between population movement, antigenic drift and persistence during the intensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) phase. The influenza B/Yamagata lineage disappeared in a context of reduced relative genetic diversity, moderate lineage turnover, and lower positive selection pressure. Our results demonstrate that mobility perturbations reshaped the global dispersal dynamics of influenza viruses, with potential implications for vaccine design and genomic surveillance programmes. As the risk of future pandemics persists, our study provides an opportunity to assess the impact of NPIs during the pandemic on respiratory infectious diseases beyond the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.\nHybrid immunity improves the immune response after fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose in individuals with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19\nAuthors: Ekstrom, N.; Leino, T. M.; Juutinen, A.; Lehtonen, T.; Haveri, A.; Liedes, O.; Vara, S.; Salo, H.; Palmu, A. A.; Nohynek, H.; Martelius, T.; Melin, M.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300374\nBackgroundData on Covid-19 booster vaccinations and subsequent infections on immune responses in the immunocompromised is limited. We studied antibody responses after the fourth dose and subsequent breakthrough infection to define patient groups benefiting most from boosters. MethodsIn Finland, fourth vaccine (booster) doses were first recommended for severely immunocompromised individuals, whom we invited to participate in 2022. We assessed spike protein specific IgG antibody levels and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the ancestral and Omicron BA.1 strains one month after the fourth dose from 488 adult participants and compared to the levels of 35 healthy controls after 3 doses. We used Bayesian generalized linear modelling to assess factors explaining antibody concentrations after the fourth dose. We assessed vaccine-induced and hybrid immunity six months after the last vaccine dose. ResultsChronic kidney disease (CKD) and immunosuppressive therapy (IT) were identified as factors explaining sub-optimal antibody responses. The proportion of participants with a normal antibody response and NAbs were significantly lower in CKD patients as compared to controls. By the 6-month sampling one third of the participants became infected, which enhanced antibody levels notably in most immunocompromised participants. ConclusionsImpaired antibody responses, especially NAbs against the Omicron lineage, predict limited protection in individuals with CKD, and highlight the need for alternative pharmaceutical preventive strategies. Vaccination strategies should take into account development of robust hybrid immunity responses also among the immunocompromised.\nBeyond Borders: Spatial Disparities in the Mortality Burden of the Covid-19 pandemic across 569 European Regions (2020-2021)\nAuthors: Bonnet, F.; Grigoriev, P.; Sauerberg, M.; Alliger, I.; Muhlichen, M.; Camarda, C.-G.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300149\nThis article presents a detailed analysis of the global mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 regions in 25 European countries. We produce sex-specific excess mortality and present our results using Age-Standardised Years of Life Lost (ASYLL) in 2020 and 2021, as well as the cumulative impact over the two pandemic years. Employing a robust forecasting approach that considers regional diversity and provides confidence intervals, we find notable losses in 362 regions in 2020 (440 regions in 2021). Conversely, only seven regions experienced gains in 2020 (four regions in 2021). Most importantly, we estimate that eight regions suffered losses exceeding 20 years of life per 1,000 population in 2020, whereas this number increased to 75 regions in 2021. The contiguity of the regions investigated in our study also reveals the changing geographical patterns of the pandemic. While the highest excess mortality values were concentrated in the early COVID-19 outbreak areas during the initial pandemic year, a clear East-West gradient appeared in 2021, with regions of Slovakia, Hungary, and Latvia experiencing the highest losses. This research underscores the importance of regional analyses for a nuanced comprehension of the pandemics impact.\nHIGH AND UNSUSTAINABLE COST OF CONTROLLING THE DENGUE VECTOR AEDES AEGYPTI IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON\nAuthors: Durand, S.; Paredes, A.; Pacheco, C.; Fernandez, R.; Herrera, J.; Cabezas, C.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300246\nObjectivesVector control is the method of prevention and control of dengue outbreaks used in Peru. With the objective of calculating the costs incurred in vector control, an estimation of the costs of Aedes aegypti control of the Regional Health Directorate of Loreto, during the execution of the regional plan for surveillance and control of A. aegypti was carried out. Materials and methodsDocumentation was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with stakeholders about the costs of A. aegypti control interventions in its adult and larval stages, during 2017 and 2018. ResultsIt was found that the costs incurred in the control of the dengue vector in the Loreto Region in the two years studied amount to: 3,807,858 and 4,066,380 soles during 2017 and 2018 respectively, 1175,264 and 11210,232 dollars at the exchange rate of 2017 and 2018, however, the effect of the control activities is short-lived. ConclusionsThe high cost involved in vector control with the methods currently used and the short duration of its effect makes it unsustainable so studies should be conducted to find other more efficient methods of dengue control.\nSARS-CoV-2 serosurvey across multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City between 2020-2023\nAuthors: Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Wagner, A.; Monahan, B.; Floda, D.; Gonzalez-Reiche, A. S.; Tcheou, J.; Raskin, A.; Bielak, D.; Singh, G.; Morris, S.; Fried, M.; Yellin, T.; Sullivan, L.; Study Group, P.; Sordillo, E. M.; Gordon, A.; van Bakel, H.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.\nScore: 46.4, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300131\nSero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels \u003e90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.\nInfection Inspection: Using the power of citizen science to help with image-based prediction of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli\nAuthors: Farrar, A.; Feehily, C.; Turner, P.; Zagajewski, A.; Chatzimichail, S.; Crook, D.; Andersson, M.; Oakley, S.; Barrett, L.; El Sayyed, H.; Fowler, P. W.; Nellaker, C.; Kapanidis, A. N.; Stoesser, N.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299807\nAntibiotic resistance is an urgent global health challenge, necessitating rapid diagnostic tools to combat its escalating threat. This study introduces innovative approaches for expedited bacterial antimicrobial resistance profiling, addressing the critical need for swift clinical responses. Between February and April 2023, we conducted the Infection Inspection project, a citizen science initiative in which the public could participate in advancing an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method based on single-cell images of cellular phenotypes in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. A total of 5,273 users participated, classifying 1,045,199 images. Notably, aggregated user accuracy in image classification reached 66.8%, lower than our deep learning models performance at 75.3%, but accuracy increased for both users and the model when ciprofloxacin treatment was greater than a strains own minimum inhibitory concentration. We used the users classifications to elucidate which visual features influence classification decisions, most importantly the degree of DNA compaction and heterogeneity. We paired our classification data with an image feature analysis which showed that most of the incorrect classifications were due to cellular features that varied from the expected response. This understanding informs ongoing efforts to enhance the robustness of our deep learning-based bacterial classifier and diagnostic methodology. Our successful engagement with the public through citizen science is another demonstration of the potential for collaborative efforts in scientific research, specifically increasing public awareness and advocacy on the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance, and empowering individuals to actively contribute to the development of novel diagnostics. Lay summaryAntibiotic resistance is a big health problem worldwide. We need fast ways to find out if bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. In our study, we develop new methods to do this quickly. We ran an online project called Infection Inspection from February to April 2023, in which 5,273 people took part. Together, they classified more than a million pictures of bacterial cells, helping our project use these pictures to detect antibiotic resistance. The volunteers performed well, getting near 67% of the answers right. We also learned which pictures helped or confused them. This will help us make our computer program better. This project didnt just help science; it also taught people about antibiotic resistance. Partnerships between the public and scientists can make a difference to developing technologies that protect our health.\nAir cleaners and respiratory infections in schools: A modeling study using epidemiological, environmental, and molecular data\nAuthors: Banholzer, N.; Jent, P.; Bittel, P.; Zurcher, K.; Furrer, L.; Bertschinger, S.; Weingartner, E.; Ramette, A.; Egger, M.; Hascher, T.; Fenner, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300635\nBackground: Using a multiple-measurement approach, we examined the real-world effectiveness of portable HEPA-air filtration devices (air cleaners) in a school setting. Methods: We collected environmental (CO2, particle concentrations), epidemiological (absences related to respiratory infections), audio (coughing), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over seven weeks during winter 2022/2023 in two Swiss secondary school classes. Using a cross-over study design, we compared particle concentrations, coughing, and the risk of infection with vs without air cleaners. Results: All 38 students (age 13-15 years) participated. With air cleaners, mean particle con- centration decreased by 77% (95% credible interval 63%-86%). There were no differences in CO2 levels. Absences related to respiratory infections were 22 without vs 13 with air cleaners. Bayesian modeling suggested a reduced risk of infection, with a posterior probability of 91% and a relative risk of 0.73 (95% credible interval 0.44-1.18). Coughing also tended to be less frequent (posterior probability 93%). Molecular analysis detected mainly non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses in saliva (50/448 positive), but not in bioaerosols (2/105 positive) or HEPA-filters (4/160). The detection rate was similar with vs without air cleaners. Spatiotemporal analysis of positive saliva samples identified several likely transmissions. Conclusions: Air cleaners improved air quality, showed a potential benefit in reducing respiratory infections, and were associated with less coughing. Airborne detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses was rare, suggesting that these viruses may be more difficult to detect in the air. Future studies should examine the importance of close contact and long-range transmission, and the cost-effectiveness of using air cleaners.\nEffectiveness and durability of mRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine (mRNA-1273.222) against SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 and XBB sublineages\nAuthors: Ackerson, B. K.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Qian, L.; Sy, L. S.; Qiu, S.; Tubert, J. E.; Lee, G. S.; Ku, J. H.; Florea, A.; Luo, Y.; Bathala, R.; Stern, J.; Choi, S. K.; Takhar, H. S.; Aragones, M.; Marks, M. A.; Anderson, E. J.; Zhou, C. K.; Sun, T.; Talarico, C. A.; Tseng, H. F.\nScore: 91.8, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299663\nBackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for \u003e1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines. MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [\u0026ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization. ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses. ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.\nHigher loss of livelihood and impoverishment in households affected by tuberculosis compared to non-tuberculosis affected households in Zimbabwe: a cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Timire, C.; Houben, R. M.; Pedrazzoli, D.; Ferrand, R. A.; Calderwood, C. J.; Bond, V.; Mbiba, F.; Kranzer, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299470\nIntroductionTuberculosis (TB) disproportionally affects poor people, leading to income and non-income losses. Measures of socioeconomic impact of TB, e.g. impoverishment and patient costs are inadequate to capture non-income losses. We applied impoverishment and a multidimensional measure on TB and non-TB affected households in Zimbabwe. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in 270 households: 90 non-TB; 90 drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), 90 drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Household data included ownership of assets, number of household members, income and indicators on five capital assets: financial, human, social, natural and physical. We determined proportions of impoverished households for periods 12 months prior and at the time of the interview. Households with incomes below US$1.90/day were considered to be impoverished. We used principal component analysis on five capital asset indicators to create a binary outcome variable indicating loss of livelihood. Log-binomial regression was used to determine associations between loss of livelihood and type of household. ResultsTB-affected households reported higher previous episodes of TB and household members requiring care than non-TB households. Households that were impoverished 12 months prior to the study were: 21 non-TB (23%); 40 DS-TB (45%); 37 DR-TB (41%). The proportions increased to 81%, 88% and 94%, respectively by the time of interview. Overall, 56% (152/270) of households sold assets: 44% (40/90) non-TB, 58% (52/90) DS-TB and 67% (60/90) DR-TB. Childrens education was affected in 31% (56/180) of TB-affected compared to 13% (12/90) non-TB households. Overall, 133(50%) households experienced loss of livelihood, with TB-affected households twice as likely to experience loss of livelihood; adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR=2.02 (95%CI:1.35-3.03)). The effect of TB on livelihood was most pronounced in poorest households (aPR=2.64, (95%CI:1.29-5.41)). ConclusionsTB-affected households experienced greater socioeconomic losses compared to non-TB households. Multidimensional measures of TB are crucial to inform multisectoral approaches to mitigate impacts of TB and other shocks.\nPhylogeographic Inference of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Wave in Texas, USA using a Novel Spatial Transmission Count Statistic\nAuthors: Lyu, L.; Veytsel, G. E.; Stott, G.; Fox, S. J.; Dailey, C. A.; Damodaran, L.; Fujimoto, K.; Kuo, J.; Brown, P.; Sealy, R.; Brown, A.; Alabady, M.; Bahl, J.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300535\nViral genomes contain records of geographic movements and cross-scale transmission dynamics. However, the impact of population heterogeneity, particularly among rural and urban areas, on viral spread and epidemic trajectory has been less explored due to limited data availability. Intensive and widespread efforts to collect and sequence SARS-CoV-2 viral samples have enabled the development of comparative genomic approaches to reconstruct spatial transmission history and understand viral transmission across different scales. Large genomic datasets with few mutations present challenges for traditional phylodynamic approaches. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatial transmission count statistic that efficiently summarizes the geographic transmission patterns imprinted on viral phylogenies. Our analysis pipeline reconstructs a time-scaled phylogeny with ancestral trait states and identifies spatial transmission linkages, categorized as imports, local transmission, and exports. These linkages are summarized to represent the epidemic profile of the focal area. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for near real-time outbreak analysis using over 12,000 full genomes and linked epidemiological data to investigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in Texas. Our goal is to trace the Delta variant's origin, timing and to understand the role of urban and rural areas in the spatial diffusion patterns observed in Texas. Our study shows (1) highly populated urban centers were the main sources of the epidemic in Texas; (2) the outbreaks in urban centers were connected to the global epidemic; and (3) outbreaks in urban centers were locally maintained, while epidemics in rural areas were driven by repeated introductions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how the global dispersal patterns of seasonal influenza viruses were perturbed during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to inform influenza intervention and vaccination strategies in the post-pandemic period. Although global human mobility has been identified as a key driver of influenza dispersal1, alongside climatic and evolutionary factors2,3, the impact of international travel restrictions on global influenza transmission and recovery remains unknown. Here we combine molecular, epidemiological, climatic, and international travel data within a phylodynamic framework to show that, despite human mobility remaining the principal driver of global influenza virus dissemination, the pandemics onset led to a shift in the international population structure and migration network of seasonal influenza lineages. We find that South Asia and Africa played important roles as exporters and phylogenetic trunk locations of influenza in 2020 and 2021, and we highlight the association between population movement, antigenic drift and persistence during the intensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) phase. The influenza B/Yamagata lineage disappeared in a context of reduced relative genetic diversity, moderate lineage turnover, and lower positive selection pressure. Our results demonstrate that mobility perturbations reshaped the global dispersal dynamics of influenza viruses, with potential implications for vaccine design and genomic surveillance programmes. As the risk of future pandemics persists, our study provides an opportunity to assess the impact of NPIs during the pandemic on respiratory infectious diseases beyond the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundData on Covid-19 booster vaccinations and subsequent infections on immune responses in the immunocompromised is limited. We studied antibody responses after the fourth dose and subsequent breakthrough infection to define patient groups benefiting most from boosters.

MethodsIn Finland, fourth vaccine (booster) doses were first recommended for severely immunocompromised individuals, whom we invited to participate in 2022. We assessed spike protein specific IgG antibody levels and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the ancestral and Omicron BA.1 strains one month after the fourth dose from 488 adult participants and compared to the levels of 35 healthy controls after 3 doses. We used Bayesian generalized linear modelling to assess factors explaining antibody concentrations after the fourth dose. We assessed vaccine-induced and hybrid immunity six months after the last vaccine dose.

ResultsChronic kidney disease (CKD) and immunosuppressive therapy (IT) were identified as factors explaining sub-optimal antibody responses. The proportion of participants with a normal antibody response and NAbs were significantly lower in CKD patients as compared to controls. By the 6-month sampling one third of the participants became infected, which enhanced antibody levels notably in most immunocompromised participants.

ConclusionsImpaired antibody responses, especially NAbs against the Omicron lineage, predict limited protection in individuals with CKD, and highlight the need for alternative pharmaceutical preventive strategies. Vaccination strategies should take into account development of robust hybrid immunity responses also among the immunocompromised.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This article presents a detailed analysis of the global mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic across 569 regions in 25 European countries. We produce sex-specific excess mortality and present our results using Age-Standardised Years of Life Lost (ASYLL) in 2020 and 2021, as well as the cumulative impact over the two pandemic years. Employing a robust forecasting approach that considers regional diversity and provides confidence intervals, we find notable losses in 362 regions in 2020 (440 regions in 2021). Conversely, only seven regions experienced gains in 2020 (four regions in 2021). Most importantly, we estimate that eight regions suffered losses exceeding 20 years of life per 1,000 population in 2020, whereas this number increased to 75 regions in 2021. The contiguity of the regions investigated in our study also reveals the changing geographical patterns of the pandemic. While the highest excess mortality values were concentrated in the early COVID-19 outbreak areas during the initial pandemic year, a clear East-West gradient appeared in 2021, with regions of Slovakia, Hungary, and Latvia experiencing the highest losses. This research underscores the importance of regional analyses for a nuanced comprehension of the pandemics impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesVector control is the method of prevention and control of dengue outbreaks used in Peru. With the objective of calculating the costs incurred in vector control, an estimation of the costs of Aedes aegypti control of the Regional Health Directorate of Loreto, during the execution of the regional plan for surveillance and control of A. aegypti was carried out.

Materials and methodsDocumentation was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with stakeholders about the costs of A. aegypti control interventions in its adult and larval stages, during 2017 and 2018.

ResultsIt was found that the costs incurred in the control of the dengue vector in the Loreto Region in the two years studied amount to: 3,807,858 and 4,066,380 soles during 2017 and 2018 respectively, 1175,264 and 11210,232 dollars at the exchange rate of 2017 and 2018, however, the effect of the control activities is short-lived.

ConclusionsThe high cost involved in vector control with the methods currently used and the short duration of its effect makes it unsustainable so studies should be conducted to find other more efficient methods of dengue control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels &gt;90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibiotic resistance is an urgent global health challenge, necessitating rapid diagnostic tools to combat its escalating threat. This study introduces innovative approaches for expedited bacterial antimicrobial resistance profiling, addressing the critical need for swift clinical responses. Between February and April 2023, we conducted the Infection Inspection project, a citizen science initiative in which the public could participate in advancing an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method based on single-cell images of cellular phenotypes in response to ciprofloxacin exposure. A total of 5,273 users participated, classifying 1,045,199 images. Notably, aggregated user accuracy in image classification reached 66.8%, lower than our deep learning models performance at 75.3%, but accuracy increased for both users and the model when ciprofloxacin treatment was greater than a strains own minimum inhibitory concentration. We used the users classifications to elucidate which visual features influence classification decisions, most importantly the degree of DNA compaction and heterogeneity. We paired our classification data with an image feature analysis which showed that most of the incorrect classifications were due to cellular features that varied from the expected response. This understanding informs ongoing efforts to enhance the robustness of our deep learning-based bacterial classifier and diagnostic methodology. Our successful engagement with the public through citizen science is another demonstration of the potential for collaborative efforts in scientific research, specifically increasing public awareness and advocacy on the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance, and empowering individuals to actively contribute to the development of novel diagnostics.

Lay summaryAntibiotic resistance is a big health problem worldwide. We need fast ways to find out if bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. In our study, we develop new methods to do this quickly. We ran an online project called Infection Inspection from February to April 2023, in which 5,273 people took part. Together, they classified more than a million pictures of bacterial cells, helping our project use these pictures to detect antibiotic resistance. The volunteers performed well, getting near 67% of the answers right. We also learned which pictures helped or confused them. This will help us make our computer program better. This project didnt just help science; it also taught people about antibiotic resistance. Partnerships between the public and scientists can make a difference to developing technologies that protect our health.</p>

Methods: We collected environmental (CO2, particle concentrations), epidemiological (absences related to respiratory infections), audio (coughing), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over seven weeks during winter 2022/2023 in two Swiss secondary school classes. Using a cross-over study design, we compared particle concentrations, coughing, and the risk of infection with vs without air cleaners. Results: All 38 students (age 13-15 years) participated. With air cleaners, mean particle con- centration decreased by 77% (95% credible interval 63%-86%). There were no differences in CO2 levels. Absences related to respiratory infections were 22 without vs 13 with air cleaners. Bayesian modeling suggested a reduced risk of infection, with a posterior probability of 91% and a relative risk of 0.73 (95% credible interval 0.44-1.18). Coughing also tended to be less frequent (posterior probability 93%). Molecular analysis detected mainly non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses in saliva (50/448 positive), but not in bioaerosols (2/105 positive) or HEPA-filters (4/160). The detection rate was similar with vs without air cleaners. Spatiotemporal analysis of positive saliva samples identified several likely transmissions. Conclusions: Air cleaners improved air quality, showed a potential benefit in reducing respiratory infections, and were associated with less coughing. Airborne detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses was rare, suggesting that these viruses may be more difficult to detect in the air. Future studies should examine the importance of close contact and long-range transmission, and the cost-effectiveness of using air cleaners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEmerging SARS-CoV-2 sublineages continue to cause serious COVID-19 disease, but most individuals have not received COVID-19 vaccine for &gt;1 year. Assessment of long-term effectiveness of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against circulating sublineages is important to inform the potential need for vaccination with updated vaccines.

MethodsIn this test-negative study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, sequencing-confirmed BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related SARS-CoV-2-positive cases during 9/1/2022-6/30/2023 were matched 1:3 to SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We assessed mRNA-1273 bivalent relative (rVE) and absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) compared to [&amp;ge;]2 or 0 doses of original monovalent vaccine, respectively. Outcomes were BA.4/BA.5- or XBB-related infection, emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters, and hospitalization.

ResultsThe rVE analysis included 20,966 cases and 62,898 controls. rVE (95%CI) against BA.4/BA.5 at 14-60 days and 121-180 days was 52.7% (46.9-57.8%) and 35.5% (-2.8%-59.5%) for infection, and 59.3% (49.7-67.0%) and 33.2% (-28.2-68.0%) for ED/UC encounters. For BA.4/BA.5-related hospitalizations, rVE was 71.3% (44.9-85.1%) and 52.0% (-1.2-77.3%) at 14-60 days and 61-120 days, respectively. rVE against XBB at 14-60 days and 121-180 days, was 48.8% (33.4-60.7%) and -3.9% (-18.1-11.3%) for infection, 70.7% (52.4-82.0%) and 15.7% (-6.0-33.2%) for ED/UC encounters, and 87.9% (43.8-97.4%) and 57.1% (17.0-77.8%) for hospitalization. Results for VE and subgroup analyses (age, immunocompromise, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were similar to rVE analyses.

ConclusionsrVE of mRNA-1273 bivalent vaccine against BA.4/BA.5 and XBB infections, ED/UC encounters, and hospitalizations waned over time. Periodic adjustment of vaccines to target emerging variants and revaccination may be important in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

SummarymRNA-1273 BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with BA.4/BA.5-related and XBB-related sublineages waned over time. Periodic vaccination with vaccines reflecting circulating variants may reduce SARS-CoV-2 associated morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) disproportionally affects poor people, leading to income and non-income losses. Measures of socioeconomic impact of TB, e.g. impoverishment and patient costs are inadequate to capture non-income losses. We applied impoverishment and a multidimensional measure on TB and non-TB affected households in Zimbabwe.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in 270 households: 90 non-TB; 90 drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), 90 drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Household data included ownership of assets, number of household members, income and indicators on five capital assets: financial, human, social, natural and physical. We determined proportions of impoverished households for periods 12 months prior and at the time of the interview. Households with incomes below US$1.90/day were considered to be impoverished. We used principal component analysis on five capital asset indicators to create a binary outcome variable indicating loss of livelihood. Log-binomial regression was used to determine associations between loss of livelihood and type of household.

ResultsTB-affected households reported higher previous episodes of TB and household members requiring care than non-TB households. Households that were impoverished 12 months prior to the study were: 21 non-TB (23%); 40 DS-TB (45%); 37 DR-TB (41%). The proportions increased to 81%, 88% and 94%, respectively by the time of interview. Overall, 56% (152/270) of households sold assets: 44% (40/90) non-TB, 58% (52/90) DS-TB and 67% (60/90) DR-TB. Childrens education was affected in 31% (56/180) of TB-affected compared to 13% (12/90) non-TB households. Overall, 133(50%) households experienced loss of livelihood, with TB-affected households twice as likely to experience loss of livelihood; adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR=2.02 (95%CI:1.35-3.03)). The effect of TB on livelihood was most pronounced in poorest households (aPR=2.64, (95%CI:1.29-5.41)).

ConclusionsTB-affected households experienced greater socioeconomic losses compared to non-TB households. Multidimensional measures of TB are crucial to inform multisectoral approaches to mitigate impacts of TB and other shocks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viral genomes contain records of geographic movements and cross-scale transmission dynamics. However, the impact of population heterogeneity, particularly among rural and urban areas, on viral spread and epidemic trajectory has been less explored due to limited data availability. Intensive and widespread efforts to collect and sequence SARS-CoV-2 viral samples have enabled the development of comparative genomic approaches to reconstruct spatial transmission history and understand viral transmission across different scales. Large genomic datasets with few mutations present challenges for traditional phylodynamic approaches. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatial transmission count statistic that efficiently summarizes the geographic transmission patterns imprinted on viral phylogenies. Our analysis pipeline reconstructs a time-scaled phylogeny with ancestral trait states and identifies spatial transmission linkages, categorized as imports, local transmission, and exports. These linkages are summarized to represent the epidemic profile of the focal area. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for near real-time outbreak analysis using over 12,000 full genomes and linked epidemiological data to investigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in Texas. Our goal is to trace the Delta variant&#39;s origin, timing and to understand the role of urban and rural areas in the spatial diffusion patterns observed in Texas. Our study shows (1) highly populated urban centers were the main sources of the epidemic in Texas; (2) the outbreaks in urban centers were connected to the global epidemic; and (3) outbreaks in urban centers were locally maintained, while epidemics in rural areas were driven by repeated introductions.</p>
