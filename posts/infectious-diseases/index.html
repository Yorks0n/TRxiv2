M.\nScore: 300.6, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298565\nAdverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P\u003c.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P\u003c.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P\u003c.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P\u003c.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P\u003c.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P\u003c.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.\nEfficacy of Wolbachia-mediated sterility for control of dengue: emulation of a cluster randomized target trial\nAuthors: Lim, J. T.; Mailepessov, D.; Chong, C. S.; Dickens, B.; Yee Ling, L.; Ng, Y.; Deng, L.; Lee, C.; Tan, L. Y.; Chain, G.; Ho, S. H.; Chang, C.-C.; Pei, M.; Bansal, S.; Lee, V.; Sim, S.; Tan, C. H.; Ng, L. C. L.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.23299172\nBackgroundMatings between male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with wAlbB strain of Wolbachia and wildtype females yield non-viable eggs. We evaluated the efficacy of releasing wAlbB-infected Ae. aegypti male mosquitoes to suppress dengue. MethodsWe specified the protocol of a two-arm cluster-randomised test-negative controlled trial (cRCT) and emulated it using a nationally representative test-negative/positive database of individuals reporting for febrile illness to any public hospital, general practitioner or polyclinic. We built a cohort of individuals who reside in Wolbachia locations versus a comparator control group who do not reside in Wolbachia locations. We emulated a constrained randomisation protocol used in cRCTs to balance dengue risk between intervention and control arms in the pre-intervention period. We used the inverse-probability weighting approach to further balance the intervention and control groups using a battery of algorithmically selected sociodemographic, environmental and anthropogenic variables. Intention-to-treat analyses was conducted to estimate the risk reduction of dengue given Wolbachia exposure. FindingsThe final cohort consisted of 7,049 individuals residing in areas treated by Wolbachia interventions for at least 3 months and 69,216 individuals residing in non-treated areas in the same time period. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, compared with controls, Wolbachia releases for 3, 6, 12 or more months was associated to a 47% (Odds ratio (OR): 0.53 [0.45-0.62]), 47% (OR: 0.53 [0.50-0.65]) and 59% (OR: 0.41 [0.39-0.50]) protective efficacy against dengue respectively. When exposed to 12 or more months of Wolbachia releases, protective efficacy ranged from 36% (OR: 0.64 [0.58-0.96]) to 77% (OR: 0.23 [0.22-0.33]) dependent on township, and from 48% (OR: 0.52 [0.48-0.7]) to 78% (OR: 0.22 [0.09-0.32]) across years. The proportion of virologically confirmed dengue cases was lower overall in the intervention arm, and across each subgroup. Protective efficacies were found across all townships, years, age and sex subgroups, with higher durations of Wolbachia exposure similarly associated to greater risk reductions of dengue. InterpretationOur results demonstrated the potential of Wolbachia-mediated sterility for strengthening dengue control in tropical cities, where dengue burden is the greatest.

H.; Kim, H. J.; Kim, M.-H.; Choi, M. G.; Chun, E. M.\nScore: 158.9, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298566\nObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination. ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs. ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.\nDiagnostic Performance of Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2: The COVid-19 AntiGen (COVAG) Extension study\nAuthors: Wertenauer, C.; Dressel, A.; Wieland, E.; Wertenauer, H.-J.; Braitmaier, H.; Straub, A.; Luetzner, N.; Maerz, W.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.23299183\nBackgroundRapid antigen tests (RATs) for SARS-CoV-2 have been used to combat the still ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This study is the extension of the COVAG study originally performed from February 1 to March 31, 2021. We compared two RATs, the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) and the SD Biosensor Q SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche), against RT-PCR on the foil of new variants. MethodsWe included 888 all-comers at a diagnostic center between October 20, 2021, and March 18, 2022. RT-PCR-positive samples with a Ct value [\u0026le;] 32 were examined for SARS-CoV-2 variants. FindingsThe sensitivity of the Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT were 65% and 67%, respectively. For both RATs, lower Ct values were significantly correlated with higher sensitivity. For samples with Ct values [\u0026le;] 25, the sensitivities of the Roche-RAT and of the Abbott-RAT were 96% and 95%, for Ct values 25-30 both were 19%, and for Ct values [\u0026ge;] 30 they were 6% and 2%, respectively. The RATs had substantially higher sensitivities in symptomatic than asymptomatic participants (76, 77%, vs. 29, 31%, for Abbott-RAT, Roche-RAT, respectively) and in participants referred to testing by their primary care physician (84%, 85%) compared to participants who sought testing due to referral by the health department (55%, 58%) or a warning by the Corona-Warn-App (49%, 49%). In persons with self-reported previous Covid-19 sensitivities were markedly lower than in patients without previous Covid-19: 27% vs. 75% for Roche-RAT and 27% vs. 73% for Abbott-RAT. Depending on the vaccination status, the sensitivity of the RATs is 67.6%, 61.5% and 70.6% for non-vaccinated, vaccinated and boostered participants, respectively. For the considered subpopulation of 888 participants, we find no significant correlation between vaccination status and sensitivity. The Omicron variant was detected with a sensitivity of 94% and 92%, the delta variant with a sensitivity of 80% and 80% for Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT, respectively. This difference is attributable to the lower Ct values of the Omicron samples compared to the Delta samples. When adjusted for the Ct value, a multivariate logistic regression did not show a significant difference between Omicron and Delta. In terms of sensitivity, we found no significant difference between the wild-type and the Omicron and Delta variants, but a significantly lower sensitivity to the alpha variant compared to the other variants. For a Ct value [\u0026le;] 25 the sensitivities were 95.2% and 96.0% for the Abbott-RAT and the Roche-RAT, respectively (Table 4). For a Ct value of 25-30 both RATs had a sensitivity of 18.8%. For a Ct value of 30-32, the sensitivities were 0.0% and 7.1% respectively, for Ct values [\u0026ge;]32 the sensitivities were 3.0% and 6.0% for Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT, respectively. The specificities were \u003e99% overall. Interpretation: The sensitivity of the RATs for asymptomatic carriers is unsatisfactory questioning their use for screening. When used in symptomatic patients or when requested by a primary care physician the sensitivities were higher. Our study does not suggest that the vaccination status influences the sensitivity of RATs.\nPredicting vaccine effectiveness in Mpox\nAuthors: Berry, M. T.; Khan, S. R.; Schlub, T. E.; Notaras, A.; Kunasekaran, M.; Grulich, A. E.; MacIntyre, C. R.; Davenport, M. P.; Khoury, D. S.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298850\nThe Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine developed by Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was widely deployed to prevent Mpox during the 2022 global outbreak. This vaccine was initially approved for Mpox based on its reported immunogenicity and effectiveness in animal models, rather than evidence of clinical efficacy. However no validated correlate of protection after vaccination has been identified. Here we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis of the available data to test whether vaccinia-binding ELISA endpoint titer is predictive of vaccine effectiveness against Mpox. We observe a significant correlation between vaccine effectiveness and vaccinia-binding antibody titers, consistent with the existing assumption that antibody levels may be a correlate of protection. Combining this data with analysis of antibody kinetics after vaccination, we predict the durability of protection after vaccination and the impact of dose spacing. Although further work is required to validate this correlate, this study provides the first evidence-based approach for using antibody measurements to predict the effectiveness of Mpox vaccination. Mpox virus (formerly Monkeypox) is a zoonotic virus endemic in West Africa, with significant outbreaks in 1980-1986 and in 1997-19981, resulting in over 20,000 total recorded cases. Prior to 2017, these outbreaks were typically small and initiated by zoonotic transmission followed by self-terminating human-to-human chains of transmission2. However, since 2017, there has been a resurgence of Mpox in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other parts of Africa, attributed to waning immunity from smallpox vaccines and accumulation of cohorts that have never been vaccinated against smallpox3. In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox resulted in 91000+ confirmed cases in 115 countries and established chains of human-human transmission leading to a renewed focus on vaccination as a preventative measure for Mpox4. Although there is no Mpox-specific vaccine, first generation smallpox vaccination was observed to protect individuals against Mpox infection during the 1980-1986 Mpox outbreak in the DRC (then Zaire)5-8, with an estimated vaccine effectiveness of approximately 85%5, and this has also been observed in similar subsequent studies9-11. However, the livereplicating vaccinia vaccines (first and second-generation) have significant risks of serious vaccine adverse events12, which led to the development of the third-generation Modified Vaccinia Ankara live-attenuated (replication deficient) vaccine (MVA-BN). Prior to the 2022 Mpox outbreak, MVA-BN was approved by the FDA for use as a Smallpox and Mpox vaccine (two doses of 1 x 108 TCID via subcutaneous injection). Given the challenge of directly assessing the efficacy of this vaccine in an RCT, regulatory approval was based on demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity profile and improved safety compared to the second-generation ACAM2000 vaccine13. In particular, comparing vaccinia neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination of MVA-BN and ACAM2000, it was deemed \"reasonable to expect that this regimen of the vaccine is effective in smallpox vaccinia-naive as well as in smallpox vaccine experienced individuals\"13. This was supported by studies in nonhuman primates implicating antibodies directly in mediating protection against lethal Mpox challenge14. Analysis of case data during the 2022 global outbreak indicates that the MVA-BN vaccine is effective for prevention of Mpox15-20, and affirms the decisions to use these vaccines during the outbreaks. However, important questions remain to be addressed. Firstly, how does MVA-BN effectiveness compare with the protection conferred by the live replicating smallpox vaccines, and how many doses are required? Further, is the protection from MVA-BN vaccination expected to be durable, and will further booster doses be required to confer durable protection against Mpox and protect individuals in potential future outbreaks? Here we address these questions by aggregating the available data on the effectiveness of different vaccinia-based vaccination regimes in protection against Mpox. We compare protection from first generation smallpox vaccines with the protection conferred by one or two doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. Further, given the assumed role of antibodies, we aggregate data on vaccinia-specific ELISA endpoint titers (here after referred to as vaccinia-binding titers) after MVA-BN vaccination (which have been shown to correlate with neutralizing antibody titers to Mpox after vaccinia vaccination21), and study the relationship between antibody levels and effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the kinetics of antibody decay over time to predict the duration of protection afforded by 1, 2 or 3 doses of vaccination. This work offers a data-driven approach to support public health decision making on Mpox vaccination and boosting campaigns.\nOne year health outcomes associated with systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Leavy, O. C.; Russell, R. J.; Harrison, E. M.; Lone, N. I.; Kerr, S.; Docherty, A. B.; Sheikh, A.; Richardson, M.; Elneima, O.; Greening, N. J.; Harris, V. C.; Houchen-Wolloff, L.; McAuley, H. J.

R.; Greenhalf, W.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.23298162\nBackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge. MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias. FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups. InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed. Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge\nThe Antiviral Mechanism of Action of Molnupiravir in Humans with COVID-19\nAuthors: Sheahan, T.

A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298766\nMeaningful metrics of antiviral activity are essential for determining the efficacy of therapeutics in human clinical trials. Molnupiravir (MOV) is a broadly acting antiviral nucleoside analog prodrug that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an assay, Culture-PCR, to better understand the impact of MOV therapy on infectious SARS-CoV-2. Culture-PCR revealed MOV eliminated infectious virus within 48 hours in the nasopharyngeal compartment, the upper airway location with the greatest levels of infectious virus. MOV therapy was associated with increases in mutations across the viral genome but select regions were completely unaffected, thus identifying regions where mutation likely abrogates infectivity. MOV therapy did not alter the magnitude or neutralization capacity of the humoral immune response, a documented correlate of protection. Thus, we provide holistic insights into the function of MOV in adults with COVID-19.\nErythrovirus B19 (B19V) in patients with acute febrile illness suspected of arboviruses in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil\nAuthors: Lichs, G.

The importance of erythrovirus B19 in human pathology has been increased and reported in numerous studies published globally. The B19V infection was investigated by real-time PCR in samples from patients with signs and symptoms related to classic arboviral symptoms. This study was conducted to provide information on the genetic diversity of Human Erythrovirus B19 (B19V) circulating in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Midwest region of Brazil, from 2017 to 2022. A total of 773 sera samples of patients with negative diagnostic results for Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika, during the study period were analyzed. Erythrovirus DNA was found in 10.6% (82/773) of patients, among them 10 were pregnant women. Four samples were completely sequenced, and the other five partially, to genotype by phylogenetic reconstruction. All samples belong to worldwide dispersed genotype 1, subgenotype 1a. These results demonstrate the importance of including B19V in differential laboratory diagnosis for epidemiological purposes and appropriate patient management. The diagnosis for B19V should be performed, particularly among pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and individuals with hemolytic diseases, as the infection is more severe in these cases.\nPrevalence of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Diabetic Patients Visiting the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana\nAuthors: Boaitey-Biko, A. S.; Bukari, I.; Ogbe, I.; Debrah, M. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299071\nMisuse of antibiotics contributes to the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance. However, it is equally important to consider inevitable situations that may contribute to a rise in antibiotic resistance and implement best practices to ensure the minimality of their resulting adverse effects. A case in point is the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a strain of bacterium that has developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other lactams among long-term diabetic patients as observed in this study. Diabetes is associated with immunosuppression and foot ulcers, which require the constant use of antibiotics as prophylactics, as such, persons with this condition would hold bacterial populations subject to immense selective pressure and are therefore at increased risk for MRSA colonization. Furthermore, these individuals may serve as reservoirs and disseminate these highly drug-resistant strains on return to the general populace. This warranted an investigation into the prevalence of MRSA among diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital. A total of 50 samples were taken from the sampled Military Hospital by swabbing the participants skin, nose, and wounds aseptically, and 20 samples were acquired from non-diabetics to serve as controls. To culture the samples, blood, and mannitol salt agar were used. Bacteria were isolated and identified using Gram staining and other biochemical testing. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used with Muller-Hinton agar to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. According to the studys findings, antibiotic resistance was much higher among diabetic patients than among non-diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana.\nBaseline malaria infection status and RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine efficacy\nAuthors: Juraska, M.; Early, A.

K.; MacInnis, B. L.; Wirth, D. F.; Gilbert, P.; Neafsey, D. E.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298907\nBackgroundThe only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE). Methods1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection. ResultsWe observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059). ConclusionsAll tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation.

        <p class="abstract">Adverse hematologic events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The objective of this study was to investigate whether hematologic abnormalities develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Retrospective cohort analyses of data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) database were conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. We randomly selected data of half of those living in Seoul City as of January 1, 2021 with their diagnostic records up to December 31, 2021. The included participants were vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons aged 20 years or older (n= 4,203,887). Hematologic abnormalities after COVID-19 vaccination were identified as nutritional anemia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation defects, and neutropenia using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes after index date. Incidence rates of hematologic abnormalities in the vaccination group 3 months after vaccination were significantly higher than those in the nonvaccinated group: 14.79 vs. 9.59 (P&lt;.001) for nutritional anemia, 7.83 vs. 5.00 (P&lt;.001) for aplastic anemia, and 4.85 vs. 1.85 (P&lt;.001) for coagulation defects. COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with higher development of nutritional anemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.230 [95% CI, 1.129-1.339], P&lt;.001) and aplastic anemia (OR, 1.242 [95% CI, 1.110-1.390], P&lt;.001) than the viral vector vaccine. The risk of coagulation defects was increased (OR, 1.986 [95% CI, 1.523-2.589], P&lt;.001) after vaccination, and there was no risk difference between mRNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (OR, 1.075 [95% CI, 0.936-1.233], P=.306). In conclusions, COVID-19 vaccination increased the risk of hematologic abnormalities. When administering the COVID-19 vaccine, careful observation will be necessary after vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMatings between male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with wAlbB strain of Wolbachia and wildtype females yield non-viable eggs. We evaluated the efficacy of releasing wAlbB-infected Ae. aegypti male mosquitoes to suppress dengue.

MethodsWe specified the protocol of a two-arm cluster-randomised test-negative controlled trial (cRCT) and emulated it using a nationally representative test-negative/positive database of individuals reporting for febrile illness to any public hospital, general practitioner or polyclinic. We built a cohort of individuals who reside in Wolbachia locations versus a comparator control group who do not reside in Wolbachia locations. We emulated a constrained randomisation protocol used in cRCTs to balance dengue risk between intervention and control arms in the pre-intervention period. We used the inverse-probability weighting approach to further balance the intervention and control groups using a battery of algorithmically selected sociodemographic, environmental and anthropogenic variables. Intention-to-treat analyses was conducted to estimate the risk reduction of dengue given Wolbachia exposure.

FindingsThe final cohort consisted of 7,049 individuals residing in areas treated by Wolbachia interventions for at least 3 months and 69,216 individuals residing in non-treated areas in the same time period. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that, compared with controls, Wolbachia releases for 3, 6, 12 or more months was associated to a 47% (Odds ratio (OR): 0.53 [0.45-0.62]), 47% (OR: 0.53 [0.50-0.65]) and 59% (OR: 0.41 [0.39-0.50]) protective efficacy against dengue respectively. When exposed to 12 or more months of Wolbachia releases, protective efficacy ranged from 36% (OR: 0.64 [0.58-0.96]) to 77% (OR: 0.23 [0.22-0.33]) dependent on township, and from 48% (OR: 0.52 [0.48-0.7]) to 78% (OR: 0.22 [0.09-0.32]) across years. The proportion of virologically confirmed dengue cases was lower overall in the intervention arm, and across each subgroup. Protective efficacies were found across all townships, years, age and sex subgroups, with higher durations of Wolbachia exposure similarly associated to greater risk reductions of dengue.

InterpretationOur results demonstrated the potential of Wolbachia-mediated sterility for strengthening dengue control in tropical cities, where dengue burden is the greatest.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the incidence rate and risk of non-fatal irAEs, including gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, otologic, and dental problems following the COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based cohort study from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Seoul, South Korea. The non-fatal irAEs included gynecological, hematological, dermatological, ophthalmological, ear, and periodontal problems as reported by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Center. The cumulative incidence rate per 10,000 population, Odds ratio, and Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were measured to assess the non-fatal irAEs after COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsThe cIR of non-fatal irAEs for three months was significantly higher in vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated subjects, except for endometriosis. The vaccination significantly increased the risks of all the non-fatal irAEs except for visual impairment. The risk of inner ear disease showed the highest HRs (HR [95% CI] = 2.368 [2.153-2.604]) among the non-fatal irAEs following COVID-19 vaccination. Among the vaccinated subjects, heterologous vaccination was associated with the increased risk of most of the non-fatal irAEs.

ConclusionsThe three-month risks of incidental non-fatal irAEs are substantially higher in the COVID-19 vaccinated subjects than in non-vaccinated controls. Our findings suggested that vaccinated subjects with predisposition are potentially vulnerable to the occurrence of diverse irAEs although the COVID-19 vaccines may not be fatal.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRapid antigen tests (RATs) for SARS-CoV-2 have been used to combat the still ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This study is the extension of the COVAG study originally performed from February 1 to March 31, 2021. We compared two RATs, the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) and the SD Biosensor Q SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche), against RT-PCR on the foil of new variants.

MethodsWe included 888 all-comers at a diagnostic center between October 20, 2021, and March 18, 2022. RT-PCR-positive samples with a Ct value [&amp;le;] 32 were examined for SARS-CoV-2 variants.

FindingsThe sensitivity of the Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT were 65% and 67%, respectively. For both RATs, lower Ct values were significantly correlated with higher sensitivity. For samples with Ct values [&amp;le;] 25, the sensitivities of the Roche-RAT and of the Abbott-RAT were 96% and 95%, for Ct values 25-30 both were 19%, and for Ct values [&amp;ge;] 30 they were 6% and 2%, respectively. The RATs had substantially higher sensitivities in symptomatic than asymptomatic participants (76, 77%, vs. 29, 31%, for Abbott-RAT, Roche-RAT, respectively) and in participants referred to testing by their primary care physician (84%, 85%) compared to participants who sought testing due to referral by the health department (55%, 58%) or a warning by the Corona-Warn-App (49%, 49%). In persons with self-reported previous Covid-19 sensitivities were markedly lower than in patients without previous Covid-19: 27% vs. 75% for Roche-RAT and 27% vs. 73% for Abbott-RAT. Depending on the vaccination status, the sensitivity of the RATs is 67.6%, 61.5% and 70.6% for non-vaccinated, vaccinated and boostered participants, respectively. For the considered subpopulation of 888 participants, we find no significant correlation between vaccination status and sensitivity.

The Omicron variant was detected with a sensitivity of 94% and 92%, the delta variant with a sensitivity of 80% and 80% for Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT, respectively. This difference is attributable to the lower Ct values of the Omicron samples compared to the Delta samples. When adjusted for the Ct value, a multivariate logistic regression did not show a significant difference between Omicron and Delta. In terms of sensitivity, we found no significant difference between the wild-type and the Omicron and Delta variants, but a significantly lower sensitivity to the alpha variant compared to the other variants.

For a Ct value [&amp;le;] 25 the sensitivities were 95.2% and 96.0% for the Abbott-RAT and the Roche-RAT, respectively (Table 4). For a Ct value of 25-30 both RATs had a sensitivity of 18.8%. For a Ct value of 30-32, the sensitivities were 0.0% and 7.1% respectively, for Ct values [&amp;ge;]32 the sensitivities were 3.0% and 6.0% for Abbott-RAT and Roche-RAT, respectively.

The specificities were &gt;99% overall.

Interpretation: The sensitivity of the RATs for asymptomatic carriers is unsatisfactory questioning their use for screening. When used in symptomatic patients or when requested by a primary care physician the sensitivities were higher. Our study does not suggest that the vaccination status influences the sensitivity of RATs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine developed by Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was widely deployed to prevent Mpox during the 2022 global outbreak. This vaccine was initially approved for Mpox based on its reported immunogenicity and effectiveness in animal models, rather than evidence of clinical efficacy. However no validated correlate of protection after vaccination has been identified. Here we performed a systematic search and meta-analysis of the available data to test whether vaccinia-binding ELISA endpoint titer is predictive of vaccine effectiveness against Mpox. We observe a significant correlation between vaccine effectiveness and vaccinia-binding antibody titers, consistent with the existing assumption that antibody levels may be a correlate of protection. Combining this data with analysis of antibody kinetics after vaccination, we predict the durability of protection after vaccination and the impact of dose spacing. Although further work is required to validate this correlate, this study provides the first evidence-based approach for using antibody measurements to predict the effectiveness of Mpox vaccination.

Mpox virus (formerly Monkeypox) is a zoonotic virus endemic in West Africa, with significant outbreaks in 1980-1986 and in 1997-19981, resulting in over 20,000 total recorded cases. Prior to 2017, these outbreaks were typically small and initiated by zoonotic transmission followed by self-terminating human-to-human chains of transmission2. However, since 2017, there has been a resurgence of Mpox in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other parts of Africa, attributed to waning immunity from smallpox vaccines and accumulation of cohorts that have never been vaccinated against smallpox3. In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox resulted in 91000&#43; confirmed cases in 115 countries and established chains of human-human transmission leading to a renewed focus on vaccination as a preventative measure for Mpox4.

Although there is no Mpox-specific vaccine, first generation smallpox vaccination was observed to protect individuals against Mpox infection during the 1980-1986 Mpox outbreak in the DRC (then Zaire)5-8, with an estimated vaccine effectiveness of approximately 85%5, and this has also been observed in similar subsequent studies9-11. However, the livereplicating vaccinia vaccines (first and second-generation) have significant risks of serious vaccine adverse events12, which led to the development of the third-generation Modified Vaccinia Ankara live-attenuated (replication deficient) vaccine (MVA-BN). Prior to the 2022 Mpox outbreak, MVA-BN was approved by the FDA for use as a Smallpox and Mpox vaccine (two doses of 1 x 108 TCID via subcutaneous injection). Given the challenge of directly assessing the efficacy of this vaccine in an RCT, regulatory approval was based on demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity profile and improved safety compared to the second-generation ACAM2000 vaccine13. In particular, comparing vaccinia neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination of MVA-BN and ACAM2000, it was deemed &#34;reasonable to expect that this regimen of the vaccine is effective in smallpox vaccinia-naive as well as in smallpox vaccine experienced individuals&#34;13. This was supported by studies in nonhuman primates implicating antibodies directly in mediating protection against lethal Mpox challenge14.

Analysis of case data during the 2022 global outbreak indicates that the MVA-BN vaccine is effective for prevention of Mpox15-20, and affirms the decisions to use these vaccines during the outbreaks. However, important questions remain to be addressed. Firstly, how does MVA-BN effectiveness compare with the protection conferred by the live replicating smallpox vaccines, and how many doses are required? Further, is the protection from MVA-BN vaccination expected to be durable, and will further booster doses be required to confer durable protection against Mpox and protect individuals in potential future outbreaks?

Here we address these questions by aggregating the available data on the effectiveness of different vaccinia-based vaccination regimes in protection against Mpox. We compare protection from first generation smallpox vaccines with the protection conferred by one or two doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. Further, given the assumed role of antibodies, we aggregate data on vaccinia-specific ELISA endpoint titers (here after referred to as vaccinia-binding titers) after MVA-BN vaccination (which have been shown to correlate with neutralizing antibody titers to Mpox after vaccinia vaccination21), and study the relationship between antibody levels and effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the kinetics of antibody decay over time to predict the duration of protection afforded by 1, 2 or 3 doses of vaccination. This work offers a data-driven approach to support public health decision making on Mpox vaccination and boosting campaigns.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces acute severity and improves survival, but longer-term effects are unknown. We hypothesised that systemic corticosteroid administration during acute COVID-19 would be associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year after discharge.

MethodsAdults admitted to hospital between February 2020 and March 2021 for COVID-19 and meeting current guideline recommendations for dexamethasone treatment were included using two prospective UK cohort studies. HRQoL, assessed by EQ-5D-5L utility index, pre-hospital and one year after discharge were compared between those receiving corticosteroids or not after propensity weighting for treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient reported recovery, physical and mental health status, and measures of organ impairment. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for survival and selection bias.

FindingsIn 1,888 participants included in the primary analysis, 1,149 received corticosteroids. There was no between-group difference in EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year (mean difference 0.004, 95% CI: -0.026 to 0.034, p = 0.77). A similar reduction in EQ-5D-5L was seen at one year between corticosteroid exposed and non-exposed groups (mean (SD) change -0.12 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.22), p = 0.32). Overall, there were no differences in secondary outcome measures. After sensitivity analyses modelled using a larger cohort of 109,318 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, EQ-5D-5L utility index at one year remained similar between the two groups.

InterpretationSystemic corticosteroids for acute COVID-19 have no impact on the large reduction in HRQoL one year after hospital discharge. Treatments to address this are urgently needed.

Take home messageSystemic corticosteroids given for acute COVID-19 do not affect health-related quality of life or other patient reported outcomes, physical and mental health outcomes, and organ function one year after hospital discharge</p>

        <p class="abstract">Meaningful metrics of antiviral activity are essential for determining the efficacy of therapeutics in human clinical trials. Molnupiravir (MOV) is a broadly acting antiviral nucleoside analog prodrug that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an assay, Culture-PCR, to better understand the impact of MOV therapy on infectious SARS-CoV-2. Culture-PCR revealed MOV eliminated infectious virus within 48 hours in the nasopharyngeal compartment, the upper airway location with the greatest levels of infectious virus. MOV therapy was associated with increases in mutations across the viral genome but select regions were completely unaffected, thus identifying regions where mutation likely abrogates infectivity. MOV therapy did not alter the magnitude or neutralization capacity of the humoral immune response, a documented correlate of protection. Thus, we provide holistic insights into the function of MOV in adults with COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human Erythrovirus (parvovirus) B19 infection can produce symptoms similar to those produced by Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika viruses, making clinical diagnosis difficult. The importance of erythrovirus B19 in human pathology has been increased and reported in numerous studies published globally. The B19V infection was investigated by real-time PCR in samples from patients with signs and symptoms related to classic arboviral symptoms. This study was conducted to provide information on the genetic diversity of Human Erythrovirus B19 (B19V) circulating in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Midwest region of Brazil, from 2017 to 2022. A total of 773 sera samples of patients with negative diagnostic results for Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika, during the study period were analyzed. Erythrovirus DNA was found in 10.6% (82/773) of patients, among them 10 were pregnant women. Four samples were completely sequenced, and the other five partially, to genotype by phylogenetic reconstruction. All samples belong to worldwide dispersed genotype 1, subgenotype 1a. These results demonstrate the importance of including B19V in differential laboratory diagnosis for epidemiological purposes and appropriate patient management. The diagnosis for B19V should be performed, particularly among pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and individuals with hemolytic diseases, as the infection is more severe in these cases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Misuse of antibiotics contributes to the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance. However, it is equally important to consider inevitable situations that may contribute to a rise in antibiotic resistance and implement best practices to ensure the minimality of their resulting adverse effects. A case in point is the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a strain of bacterium that has developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other lactams among long-term diabetic patients as observed in this study. Diabetes is associated with immunosuppression and foot ulcers, which require the constant use of antibiotics as prophylactics, as such, persons with this condition would hold bacterial populations subject to immense selective pressure and are therefore at increased risk for MRSA colonization. Furthermore, these individuals may serve as reservoirs and disseminate these highly drug-resistant strains on return to the general populace. This warranted an investigation into the prevalence of MRSA among diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital. A total of 50 samples were taken from the sampled Military Hospital by swabbing the participants skin, nose, and wounds aseptically, and 20 samples were acquired from non-diabetics to serve as controls. To culture the samples, blood, and mannitol salt agar were used. Bacteria were isolated and identified using Gram staining and other biochemical testing. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used with Muller-Hinton agar to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. According to the studys findings, antibiotic resistance was much higher among diabetic patients than among non-diabetic patients at the 37-Military Hospital in the Accra Metropolis, Ghana.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, confers moderate protection against symptomatic disease. Because many malaria infections are asymptomatic, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal parasite genotyping study of samples from a clinical trial exploring how vaccine dosing regimen affects vaccine efficacy (VE).

Methods1,500 children aged 5-17 months were randomized to receive four different RTS,S/AS01E regimens or a rabies control vaccine in a phase 2b clinical trial in Ghana and Kenya. We evaluated the time to the first new genotypically detected infection and the total number of new infections during two follow-up periods in over 36K participant specimens. We performed a post hoc analysis of VE based on malaria infection status at first vaccination and force of infection.

ResultsWe observed significant and comparable VE (25-43%, 95% CI union 9-53%) against first new infection for all four RTS,S/AS01E regimens across both follow-up periods (12 and 20 months). Each RTS,S/AS01E regimen significantly reduced the number of new infections in the 20-month follow-up period (control mean 4.1 vs. RTS,S/AS01E mean 2.6-3.0). VE against first new infection was significantly higher in participants who were malaria-infected (68%; 95% CI, 50 to 80%) versus uninfected (37%; 95% CI, 23 to 48%) at the first vaccination (P=0.0053) and in participants experiencing greater force of infection between dose 1 and 3 (P=0.059).

ConclusionsAll tested dosing regimens blocked some infections to a similar degree. Improved VE in participants infected during vaccination could suggest new strategies for highly efficacious malaria vaccine development and implementation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03276962)</p>
