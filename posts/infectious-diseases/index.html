For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented. ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1 that were similar to those seen for XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines. ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2) as well as more recent (EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1) variants. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.\nKinetics and durability of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination\nAuthors: Srivastava, K.; Carreno Quiroz, J. M.; Gleason, C.; Monahan, B.; Singh, G.; Abbad, A.; Tcheou, J.; Raskin, A.; Kleiner, G.; van Bakel, H.; Sordillo, E. M.; PARIS Study Group, ; Krammer, F. M.; Simon, V.\nScore: 429.5, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294679\nWe analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using \u003e8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.\nImprovement of immune dysregulation and health-related quality of life in individuals with long COVID at 24-months following SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Phetsouphanh, C.; Jacka, B.; Ballouz, S.; Jackson, K. J.; Wilson, D. B.; Manandhar, B.; Klemm, V.; Tan, H.-X.; Wheatley, A.; Aggarwal, A.; Akerman, A.; Milogiannakis, V.; Starr, M.; Cunningham, P.; Turville, S. G.; Kent, S. J.; Byrne, A.; Brew, B. J.; Darley, D. R.; Dore, G. J.; Kelleher, A. D.; Matthews, G. V.\nScore: 88.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.23294704\nThis study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in individuals with long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24-months. LC participants showed elevated spike and nucleocapsid IgG levels, higher neutralizing capacity, and increased spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 3- and 8-months, but these differences did not persist at 24-months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{beta}, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 24-month timepoint revealed similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of naive T and B cell subsets in LC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones were observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24-months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count were associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.\nRetrospective, observational analysis of the first one hundred consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium\nAuthors: Pirnay, J.-P.; Djebara, S.; Steurs, G.; Griselain, J.; Cochez, C.; De Soir, S.; Glonti, T.; Spiessens, A.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Green, S.; Wagemans, J.; Lood, C.; Schrevens, E.; Chanishvili, N.; Kutateladze, M.; de Jode, M.; Ceyssens, P.-J.; Draye, J.-P.; Verbeken, G.; De Vos, D.; Rose, T.; Onsea, J.; Van Nieuwenhuyse, B.; Bacteriophage Therapy Providers, ; Bacteriophage Donors, ; Soentjens, P.; Lavigne, R.; Merabishvili, M.\nScore: 57.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294728\nIn contrast to the many reports of successful cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy, randomized controlled trials of non-personalized bacteriophage products did not bring the expected results. Here, we present the outcomes of a retrospective, observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin \u0026 soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively. Eradication was 70% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds-ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.127-0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage-antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8% (7/16 patients) and 90% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5% (5/13) of screened patients. (BT100 study, ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05498363.)\nHow will COVID-19 persist in the future? Simulating future dynamics of COVID-19 using an agent-based network model\nAuthors: Roubenoff, E.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294791\nDespite the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)'s May 2023 expiration of the declared public health emergency pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic (Silk 2023), approximately 3 years after the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the United Sates, thousands of new cases persist daily. Many questions persist about the future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2's in the United States, including: will COVID continue to circulate as a seasonal disease like influenza, and will annual vaccinations be required to prevent outbreaks? In response, we present an Agent Based Networked Simulation of COVID-19 transmission to evaluate recurrent future outbreaks of the disease, accounting for contact heterogeneity and waning vaccine-derived and natural immunity. Our model is parameterized with data collected as part of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS; Feehan and Mahmud 2021) and is used to simulate time series of confirmed cases of and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, paying special attention to seasonal forces and waning immunity (Kronfeld-Schor et al. 2021; X. Liu et al. 2021; Nichols et al. 2021). From the BICS ABM model we simulate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics over the 10-year period beginning in 2021 with waning immunity and inclusion of annual booster doses under a variety of transmission scenarios. We find that SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to occur frequently, and that distribution of booster doses during certain times of the year-notably in the late winter/early spring-may reduce the severity of a wintertime outbreak depending on the seasonal epidemiology of the pathogen.\nProtection conferred by COVID-19 vaccination, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or hybrid immunity against Omicron-associated severe outcomes among community-dwelling adults\nAuthors: Lee, N.; Nguyen, L.; Austin, P. C.; Brown, K. A.; Grewal, R.; Buchan, S. A.; Nasreen, S.; Gubbay, J.; Schwartz, K. L.; Tadrous, M.; Wilson, K.; Wilson, S. E.; Kwong, J. C.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294503\nIntroductionWe assessed protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron-associated severe outcomes during successive sublineage-predominant periods. MethodsWe used a test-negative design to estimate protection by vaccines and/or prior infection against hospitalization/death among community-dwelling, PCR-tested adults aged [\u0026ge;]50 years in Ontario, Canada between January 2, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relative change in the odds of hospitalization/death with each vaccine dose (2-5) and/or prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (compared with unvaccinated, uninfected subjects) up to 15 months since the last vaccination or infection. ResultsWe included 18,526 cases with Omicron-associated severe outcomes and 90,778 test-negative controls. Vaccine protection was high during BA.1/BA.2 predominance, but was generally \u003c50% during periods of BA.4/BA.5 and BQ/XBB predominance without boosters. A third/fourth dose transiently increased protection during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 68%, 95%CI 63%-72%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 80%, 95%CI 77%-83%), but was lower and waned quickly during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 59%, 95%CI 48%-67%; 12-month: 49%, 95%CI 41%-56%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 62%, 95%CI 56%-68%, 12-months: 51%, 95%CI 41%-56%). Hybrid immunity conferred nearly 90% protection throughout BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 predominance, but was reduced during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 60%, 95%CI 36%-75%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 63%, 95%CI 42%-76%). Protection was restored with a fifth dose (bivalent; 6-month: 91%, 95%CI 79%-96%). Prior infection alone did not confer lasting protection. ConclusionProtection from COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infections against severe outcomes is reduced when immune-evasive variants/subvariants emerge and may also wane over time. Our findings support a variant-adapted booster vaccination strategy with periodic review.\nEnsitrelvir Fumaric Acid in Patients with SARS-CoV-2: A Retrospective Chart Review\nAuthors: Yamato, M.; Kinoshita, M.; Miyazawa, S.; Seki, M.; Mizuno, T.; Sonoyama, T.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294865\nIntroduction: Antivirals with differing mechanisms of action are needed for COVID 19 treatment; remdesivir is mainly used in hospitalized patients, but additional antivirals are needed in this setting. Ensitrelvir, a 3C like protease inhibitor, received emergency approval in Japan in November 2022, based on evidence of rapid symptom resolution in nonhospitalized patients, but confirmation of its efficacy in hospitalized patients is lacking. Case presentations: This case series reports outcomes for all patients who received ensitrelvir whilst hospitalized with SARS CoV 2 infection at Rinku General Medical Center, Japan (November 2022 to April 2023). Thirty two hospitalized patients received five days of ensitrelvir treatment (375/125 mg). Mean age was 73.5 years and most patients had mild COVID 19. Patients exhibited various underlying diseases, most commonly hypertension (78.1%) and chronic kidney disease (25.0%). Seven (21.9%) patients were on hemodialysis. The most common concomitant medications were antihypertensives (59.4%) and corticosteroids (31.2%); two (6.3%) patients were being treated with rituximab; 27 (84.4%) patients had viral persistence following pretreatment remdesivir failure. Following ensitrelvir treatment, all patients experienced clinical improvement as assessed by the investigator. No ICU admissions or deaths due to COVID 19 occurred. Viral clearance was recorded in 18 (56.3%) patients by day 5 and 25 (78.1%) patients at final measurement. No new safety signals were observed. Discussion: This case series represents ensitrelvir clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with SARS CoV 2 in a real world setting. Most patients experienced persistent viral shedding despite pretreatment with antivirals, and most were considered high risk due to underlying conditions. Despite this, no patients experienced progression of COVID 19 to severe or critical disease, including those who failed prior remdesivir treatment. The antiviral activity of ensitrelvir demonstrated here indicates it is a viable treatment option for SARS CoV 2 infection in this setting. Conclusion: Ensitrelvir was associated with potent antiviral activity and positive clinical outcomes in high risk, hospitalized patients with various comorbidities.

H.; Campbell, W.; Robinson, S.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294626\nBackgroundWe sought to determine immune and behavioral pre-infection correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccine infections in a joint analysis of epidemiological and immunological cohort data. MethodsSerum and saliva samples from 176 BNT162b2-vaccinated adults in the Prospective Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion study were collected between October and December 2021 and assessed for serum and saliva levels of Wuhan-1 wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG and IgA binding antibodies (bAb) using a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA). Serum samples were also assessed for WT receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific bAb by two commercial assays, BA.1 S-specific IgG bAb by MMIA, and neutralization activity against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants using a lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay. After the Fall 2021 visit, participants reported all positive PCR and/or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Duration, severity, and type of symptoms, as well as risk exposures and adherence to precautionary measures, were assessed by questionnaires during the Spring 2022 visit. ResultsThirty-two participants (18.2%) developed symptomatic post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections (PVI) between December 7, 2021 and April 1, 2022. Pre-infection WT (geometric mean (GM) of 3,863 vs 2,736 binding antibody unit [BAU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0098) and BA.1 (GM of 276.9 vs 179.9 arbitrary bAb unit [AU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.04) anti-S IgG bAb levels measured by MMIA and neutralizing titers (NT) against BA.1 (GM titer [GMT] of 493.6 vs 286.2, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0313) and BA.1.1 (GMT of 552.0 vs 302.5, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.021) were significantly higher in individuals that did not develop PVIs. WT anti-S bAb levels greater than 5,000 BAU/ml were associated with \u003e 90% protection against symptomatic PVI. In individuals that developed PVI, WT anti-S IgG bAb levels correlated with lower disease severity scores ({rho}= -0.3859, p=0.032) and shorter duration of clinical disease ({rho}= -0.5273, p=0.0023). WT anti-RBD bAb levels measured by commercial assays correlated strongly with bAb levels measured by MMIA ({rho}=0.8239, p\u003c0.0001 and {rho}=0.6929, p\u003c0.0001, Roche and Siemens assays, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance for correlation with protection against PVI. Home risk score, but neither work nor home precautionary measures, correlated strongly with risk of PVI (mean score of 20.77 vs 47.33, uninfected vs PVI respectively, p\u003c0.0001). ConclusionsAnti-S IgG bAb levels (directed against either WT or Omicron BA.1 subvariant) and NTs served as correlates of protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-S (WT) IgG bAb levels remained a significant correlate of protection against PVIs when adjusting for demography and risk behavior. Results of this study also suggest that commercial assays for anti-S bAb may need to be reformatted to enable detection of higher maximum values for use as predictors of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nOutpatient treatment with concomitant vaccine-boosted convalescent plasma for patients with immunosuppression and COVID-19\nAuthors: Ripoll Sanz, J.; Tulledge-Scheitel, S.; Ford, S.; Pike, M.; Gorman, E.

J.; Senefeld, J.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23293790\nAlthough severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and hospitalization associated with COVID-19 are generally preventable among healthy vaccine recipients, patients with immunosuppression have poor immunogenic responses to COVID-19 vaccines and remain at high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalization. Additionally, monoclonal antibody therapy is limited by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that have serially escaped neutralization. In this context, there is interest in understanding the clinical benefit associated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma collected from persons who have been both naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (\"vax-plasma\"). Thus, we report the clinical outcome of 208 immunocompromised outpatients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and who received contemporary COVID-19 specific therapeutics (standard of care group) and a subgroup who also received concomitant treatment with very high titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (vax-plasma group) with a specific focus on hospitalization rates. The overall hospitalization rate was 1% (1 of 123 patients) in the vax-plasma group and 6% (5 of 85 patients) in the standard of care group, which corresponded to a relative risk reduction of 83%. Evidence of efficacy in nonvaccinated patients cannot be inferred from these data because 94% (196 of 208 patients) of patients were vaccinated. In vaccinated patients with immunosuppression and COVID-19, the addition of vax-plasma or very high titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma to COVID-19 specific therapies reduced the risk of disease progression leading to hospitalization. Key PointsO_LIAdministration of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with a decreased incidence of hospitalization among immunocompromised outpatients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. C_LIO_LIHigh-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma represents a promising therapeutic approach for patients with immunosuppression.

P.; Mills, E.; Waggle, K.; Rangachar Srinivasa, V.; Ayres, A. M.; Bradford, C.; Creager, H.; Pless, L. L.; Sundermann, A. J.; Van Tyne, D.; Snyder, G. M.; Harrison, L. H.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294545\nBackground: New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase (NDM) represents an emergent mechanism of carbapenem resistance associated with high mortality and limited antimicrobial treatment options. Because the blaNDM resistance gene is often carried on plasmids, traditional infection prevention and control (IP\u0026C) surveillance methods like speciation, antimicrobial resistance testing, and reactive whole genome sequencing (WGS) may not detect plasmid transfer in multispecies outbreaks. Methods: Initial outbreak detection of NDM-producing Enterobacterales identified at an acute care hospital occurred via traditional IP\u0026C methods and was supplemented by real-time WGS surveillance, which was performed weekly using the Illumina platform. To resolve NDM-encoding plasmids, we performed long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing and constructed hybrid assemblies using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data. Reports of relatedness between NDM-producing organisms and reactive WGS for suspected outbreaks were shared with the IP\u0026C team for assessment and intervention. Findings: We observed a multispecies outbreak of NDM-5-producing Enterobacterales isolated from 15 patients between February 2021 and February 2023. The 19 clinical and surveillance isolates sequenced included seven bacterial species and each encoded the same NDM-5 plasmid, which showed high homology to NDM plasmids previously observed in Asia. WGS surveillance and epidemiologic investigation characterized ten horizontal plasmid transfer events and six bacterial transmission events between patients housed in varying hospital units. Transmission prevention focused on enhanced observation and adherence to basic infection prevention measures. Interpretation: Our investigation revealed a complex, multispecies outbreak of NDM that involved multiple plasmid transfer and bacterial transmission events, increasing the complexity of outbreak identification and transmission prevention. Our investigation highlights the utility of combining traditional IP\u0026C and prospective genomic methods in identifying and containing plasmid-associated outbreaks. Funding: This work was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R01AI127472) (R21AI1783691).\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSubvariants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) omicron XBB-lineage have the potential to escape immunity provided by prior infection or vaccination. For Covid-19 immunizations beginning in the Fall 2023, the U.S. FDA has recommended updating to a monovalent omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

MethodsIn this ongoing, phase 2/3 study participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 50-{micro}g doses of mRNA-1273.815 monovalent (50-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 spike mRNA) or mRNA-1273.231 bivalent (25-{micro}g omicron XBB.1.5 and 25-{micro}g omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike mRNAs vaccines, administered as 5th doses, to adults who previously received a primary series and 3rd dose of an original mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, and a 4th dose of a bivalent (omicron BA.4/BA.5 and original SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Interim safety and immunogenicity data 15 days post-vaccination are presented.

ResultsIn April 2023, participants received mRNA-1273.815 (n=50) and mRNA-1273.231 (n=51). The median intervals from the prior dose of BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent vaccine were 8.2 and 8.3 months for the mRNA-1273.815 and mRNA-1273.231 groups, respectively. Both vaccines increased neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers against all variants tested at day 15 post-booster nAb compared to pre-booster levels. Geometric mean fold-rises from pre-booster titers after the monovalent booster were higher against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) than those of the bivalent booster and were comparable against BA.4/BA.5 and BQ1.1 variants for both vaccines. The monovalent vaccine also elicited nAb responses against omicron XBB.2.3.2, EG.5.1, and FL.1.5.1 that were similar to those seen for XBB.1.5 in a subset (n=20) of participants. The occurrence of solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were overall similar to those previously reported for the original mRNA-1273 50-{micro}g and omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273 vaccines.

ConclusionIn this interim analysis, XBB.1.5-containing monovalent and bivalent vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses against variants of the omicron XBB-lineage (XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6, XBB.2.3.2) as well as more recent (EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1) variants. The safety profile of the XBB.1.5-containing vaccine was consistent with those of prior vaccines. These results support the Covid-19 vaccine update in 2023-2024 to a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using &gt;8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 - April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naive individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naive individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in individuals with long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24-months. LC participants showed elevated spike and nucleocapsid IgG levels, higher neutralizing capacity, and increased spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4&#43; T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells at 3- and 8-months, but these differences did not persist at 24-months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{beta}, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 24-month timepoint revealed similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of naive T and B cell subsets in LC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones were observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24-months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count were associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In contrast to the many reports of successful cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy, randomized controlled trials of non-personalized bacteriophage products did not bring the expected results. Here, we present the outcomes of a retrospective, observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin &amp; soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively. Eradication was 70% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds-ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.127-0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage-antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8% (7/16 patients) and 90% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5% (5/13) of screened patients. (BT100 study, ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05498363.)</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)&#39;s May 2023 expiration of the declared public health emergency pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic (Silk 2023), approximately 3 years after the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the United Sates, thousands of new cases persist daily. Many questions persist about the future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2&#39;s in the United States, including: will COVID continue to circulate as a seasonal disease like influenza, and will annual vaccinations be required to prevent outbreaks? In response, we present an Agent Based Networked Simulation of COVID-19 transmission to evaluate recurrent future outbreaks of the disease, accounting for contact heterogeneity and waning vaccine-derived and natural immunity. Our model is parameterized with data collected as part of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS; Feehan and Mahmud 2021) and is used to simulate time series of confirmed cases of and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, paying special attention to seasonal forces and waning immunity (Kronfeld-Schor et al. 2021; X. Liu et al. 2021; Nichols et al. 2021). From the BICS ABM model we simulate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics over the 10-year period beginning in 2021 with waning immunity and inclusion of annual booster doses under a variety of transmission scenarios. We find that SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to occur frequently, and that distribution of booster doses during certain times of the year-notably in the late winter/early spring-may reduce the severity of a wintertime outbreak depending on the seasonal epidemiology of the pathogen.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWe assessed protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against Omicron-associated severe outcomes during successive sublineage-predominant periods.

MethodsWe used a test-negative design to estimate protection by vaccines and/or prior infection against hospitalization/death among community-dwelling, PCR-tested adults aged [&amp;ge;]50 years in Ontario, Canada between January 2, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relative change in the odds of hospitalization/death with each vaccine dose (2-5) and/or prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (compared with unvaccinated, uninfected subjects) up to 15 months since the last vaccination or infection.

ResultsWe included 18,526 cases with Omicron-associated severe outcomes and 90,778 test-negative controls. Vaccine protection was high during BA.1/BA.2 predominance, but was generally &lt;50% during periods of BA.4/BA.5 and BQ/XBB predominance without boosters. A third/fourth dose transiently increased protection during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 68%, 95%CI 63%-72%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 80%, 95%CI 77%-83%), but was lower and waned quickly during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 59%, 95%CI 48%-67%; 12-month: 49%, 95%CI 41%-56%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 62%, 95%CI 56%-68%, 12-months: 51%, 95%CI 41%-56%). Hybrid immunity conferred nearly 90% protection throughout BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 predominance, but was reduced during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 60%, 95%CI 36%-75%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 63%, 95%CI 42%-76%). Protection was restored with a fifth dose (bivalent; 6-month: 91%, 95%CI 79%-96%). Prior infection alone did not confer lasting protection.

ConclusionProtection from COVID-19 vaccines and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infections against severe outcomes is reduced when immune-evasive variants/subvariants emerge and may also wane over time. Our findings support a variant-adapted booster vaccination strategy with periodic review.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Antivirals with differing mechanisms of action are needed for COVID 19 treatment; remdesivir is mainly used in hospitalized patients, but additional antivirals are needed in this setting. Ensitrelvir, a 3C like protease inhibitor, received emergency approval in Japan in November 2022, based on evidence of rapid symptom resolution in nonhospitalized patients, but confirmation of its efficacy in hospitalized patients is lacking. Case presentations: This case series reports outcomes for all patients who received ensitrelvir whilst hospitalized with SARS CoV 2 infection at Rinku General Medical Center, Japan (November 2022 to April 2023). Thirty two hospitalized patients received five days of ensitrelvir treatment (375/125 mg). Mean age was 73.5 years and most patients had mild COVID 19. Patients exhibited various underlying diseases, most commonly hypertension (78.1%) and chronic kidney disease (25.0%). Seven (21.9%) patients were on hemodialysis. The most common concomitant medications were antihypertensives (59.4%) and corticosteroids (31.2%); two (6.3%) patients were being treated with rituximab; 27 (84.4%) patients had viral persistence following pretreatment remdesivir failure. Following ensitrelvir treatment, all patients experienced clinical improvement as assessed by the investigator. No ICU admissions or deaths due to COVID 19 occurred. Viral clearance was recorded in 18 (56.3%) patients by day 5 and 25 (78.1%) patients at final measurement. No new safety signals were observed. Discussion: This case series represents ensitrelvir clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with SARS CoV 2 in a real world setting. Most patients experienced persistent viral shedding despite pretreatment with antivirals, and most were considered high risk due to underlying conditions. Despite this, no patients experienced progression of COVID 19 to severe or critical disease, including those who failed prior remdesivir treatment. The antiviral activity of ensitrelvir demonstrated here indicates it is a viable treatment option for SARS CoV 2 infection in this setting. Conclusion: Ensitrelvir was associated with potent antiviral activity and positive clinical outcomes in high risk, hospitalized patients with various comorbidities.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe sought to determine immune and behavioral pre-infection correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccine infections in a joint analysis of epidemiological and immunological cohort data.

MethodsSerum and saliva samples from 176 BNT162b2-vaccinated adults in the Prospective Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion study were collected between October and December 2021 and assessed for serum and saliva levels of Wuhan-1 wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific IgG and IgA binding antibodies (bAb) using a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA). Serum samples were also assessed for WT receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific bAb by two commercial assays, BA.1 S-specific IgG bAb by MMIA, and neutralization activity against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants using a lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay. After the Fall 2021 visit, participants reported all positive PCR and/or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. Duration, severity, and type of symptoms, as well as risk exposures and adherence to precautionary measures, were assessed by questionnaires during the Spring 2022 visit.

ResultsThirty-two participants (18.2%) developed symptomatic post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections (PVI) between December 7, 2021 and April 1, 2022. Pre-infection WT (geometric mean (GM) of 3,863 vs 2,736 binding antibody unit [BAU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0098) and BA.1 (GM of 276.9 vs 179.9 arbitrary bAb unit [AU]/ml, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.04) anti-S IgG bAb levels measured by MMIA and neutralizing titers (NT) against BA.1 (GM titer [GMT] of 493.6 vs 286.2, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.0313) and BA.1.1 (GMT of 552.0 vs 302.5, uninfected vs PVI, p=0.021) were significantly higher in individuals that did not develop PVIs. WT anti-S bAb levels greater than 5,000 BAU/ml were associated with &gt; 90% protection against symptomatic PVI. In individuals that developed PVI, WT anti-S IgG bAb levels correlated with lower disease severity scores ({rho}= -0.3859, p=0.032) and shorter duration of clinical disease ({rho}= -0.5273, p=0.0023). WT anti-RBD bAb levels measured by commercial assays correlated strongly with bAb levels measured by MMIA ({rho}=0.8239, p&lt;0.0001 and {rho}=0.6929, p&lt;0.0001, Roche and Siemens assays, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance for correlation with protection against PVI. Home risk score, but neither work nor home precautionary measures, correlated strongly with risk of PVI (mean score of 20.77 vs 47.33, uninfected vs PVI respectively, p&lt;0.0001).

ConclusionsAnti-S IgG bAb levels (directed against either WT or Omicron BA.1 subvariant) and NTs served as correlates of protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-S (WT) IgG bAb levels remained a significant correlate of protection against PVIs when adjusting for demography and risk behavior. Results of this study also suggest that commercial assays for anti-S bAb may need to be reformatted to enable detection of higher maximum values for use as predictors of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and hospitalization associated with COVID-19 are generally preventable among healthy vaccine recipients, patients with immunosuppression have poor immunogenic responses to COVID-19 vaccines and remain at high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalization. Additionally, monoclonal antibody therapy is limited by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that have serially escaped neutralization. In this context, there is interest in understanding the clinical benefit associated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma collected from persons who have been both naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (&#34;vax-plasma&#34;). Thus, we report the clinical outcome of 208 immunocompromised outpatients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and who received contemporary COVID-19 specific therapeutics (standard of care group) and a subgroup who also received concomitant treatment with very high titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (vax-plasma group) with a specific focus on hospitalization rates. The overall hospitalization rate was 1% (1 of 123 patients) in the vax-plasma group and 6% (5 of 85 patients) in the standard of care group, which corresponded to a relative risk reduction of 83%. Evidence of efficacy in nonvaccinated patients cannot be inferred from these data because 94% (196 of 208 patients) of patients were vaccinated. In vaccinated patients with immunosuppression and COVID-19, the addition of vax-plasma or very high titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma to COVID-19 specific therapies reduced the risk of disease progression leading to hospitalization.

Key PointsO_LIAdministration of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with a decreased incidence of hospitalization among immunocompromised outpatients who were diagnosed with COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIHigh-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma represents a promising therapeutic approach for patients with immunosuppression.

        <p class="abstract">Background: New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase (NDM) represents an emergent mechanism of carbapenem resistance associated with high mortality and limited antimicrobial treatment options. Because the blaNDM resistance gene is often carried on plasmids, traditional infection prevention and control (IP&amp;C) surveillance methods like speciation, antimicrobial resistance testing, and reactive whole genome sequencing (WGS) may not detect plasmid transfer in multispecies outbreaks. Methods: Initial outbreak detection of NDM-producing Enterobacterales identified at an acute care hospital occurred via traditional IP&amp;C methods and was supplemented by real-time WGS surveillance, which was performed weekly using the Illumina platform. To resolve NDM-encoding plasmids, we performed long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing and constructed hybrid assemblies using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data. Reports of relatedness between NDM-producing organisms and reactive WGS for suspected outbreaks were shared with the IP&amp;C team for assessment and intervention. Findings: We observed a multispecies outbreak of NDM-5-producing Enterobacterales isolated from 15 patients between February 2021 and February 2023. The 19 clinical and surveillance isolates sequenced included seven bacterial species and each encoded the same NDM-5 plasmid, which showed high homology to NDM plasmids previously observed in Asia. WGS surveillance and epidemiologic investigation characterized ten horizontal plasmid transfer events and six bacterial transmission events between patients housed in varying hospital units. Transmission prevention focused on enhanced observation and adherence to basic infection prevention measures. Interpretation: Our investigation revealed a complex, multispecies outbreak of NDM that involved multiple plasmid transfer and bacterial transmission events, increasing the complexity of outbreak identification and transmission prevention. Our investigation highlights the utility of combining traditional IP&amp;C and prospective genomic methods in identifying and containing plasmid-associated outbreaks. Funding: This work was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R01AI127472) (R21AI1783691).</p>
