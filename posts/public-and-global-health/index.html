Vaccines may have non-specific effects which are not assessed within the current regulatory framework. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs -- overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs were similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (3.03 (1.29-7.09) [0.6% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted. Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections. MeaningDespite the low risk of adverse events, the results suggest that mRNA vaccines increase the risk of severe adverse events. However, given the low risk of COVID-19 infection in children, this is relevant to consider. The results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.\nTrends in long-term vaping among adults in England, 2013-2023\nAuthors: Jackson, S. E.; Tattan-Birch, H.; Shahab, L.; Brown, J.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300376\nObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping among adults in England. DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey. SettingEngland. Participants179,725 adults ([\u0026ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023. Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod). ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively). ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults. What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people. C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use. C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping. C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day. C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

S.; Olsen, K.; Martinez Paz, E. F.; Sun, A.; Keown, J.; Lahr, R.; Steglitz, B.; Busch, A.; LiPuma, J. J.; Olson, T.; Raskin, L.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300640\nWhile real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendall's tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendall's tau=0.40, p\u003c0.01), HPC (Kendall's tau=0.20, p\u003c0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendall's tau=0.30, p\u003c0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p\u003c0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.\nRetrospective analysis of Covid-19 hospitalization modelling scenarios which guided policy response in France\nAuthors: Langevin, M.; Starck, T.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300086\nEpidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

The impacts of these attacks have resulted in both direct and indirect attacks on the health system and reverberating effects on local communities. This study aims to explore the perspectives of health workers based in northern Syria who have experienced such attacks on health to understand the impacts on the health system as well as communities served. MethodsIn-depth interviews were conducted with health workers in the northern regions of Syria where attacks on health have been frequent. Participants were identified using purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were coded and analyzed using the Framework Method. Our inductive and deductive codes aligned closely with the WHO Health System Building Blocks framework, and we therefore integrated this framing into the presentation of findings. We actively sought to include female and non-physician health workers as both groups have been under-represented in previous research in northern Syria. ResultsA total of 40 health workers (32.5% female, 77.5% non-physicians) who experienced attacks in northern Syria between 2013 and 2020 participated in interviews in 2020-2021. Participants characterized attacks on healthcare as frequent, persistent over years and strategically targeted. The attacks had both direct and indirect impacts on the health system and consequently the wider health of the community. For the health system, participants noted compounded impacts on the delivery of care, health system governance, and challenges to financing, workforce, and infrastructure. Reconstructing health facilities or planning services in the aftermath of attacks on health was challenging due to poor health system governance and resource challenges. These impacts had ripple effects on the health of the community, particularly the most vulnerable. DiscussionThe impacts of attacks on health in Syria are multiple, with both short- and long-term consequences for the health system(s) across Syria as well as the health of communities in these respective areas. Though such attacks against healthcare are illegal under international humanitarian law, this and other legal frameworks have led to little accountability in the face of such attacks both in Syria and elsewhere. Characterizing their impacts is essential to improving our understanding of the consequences of attacks as a public health issue and supporting protection and advocacy efforts.\nPredictors of Breast Self-Examination Practice Among Women Aged 20 and Above In Sidama Region, Southern Ethiopia. Health Belief Model Approach.\nAuthors: Geleta, D.; Bekele, B.; Yunkura, E.; Bogale, N.; Gemechu, L.; Gebretsadik, A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300590\nIntroduction: Breast self-examination is a straightforward, affordable, and uncomplicated approach to identify any alteration in the breast. When conducted correctly, it aids in the early detection of breast cancer and diminishes its impact on health and mortality. It is advised that women aged 20 and above perform self-examinations monthly, consistently. However, the extent of breast self-examination practices in Ethiopia has not been thoroughly documented. Objective: The aim of the study is to identify predictors of breast self-examination practices and associated factors among women aged 20 and above in Sidama Region, South Ethiopia. Methods : -A Cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 women aged 20-70 years. The study employed a multistage sampling method. Data collection was performed using a structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population in relation to relevant variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. Variables with p-value \u003c0.25 were considered as candidates for multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was declared at P \u003c 0.05 and 95% CI. Result:-The prevalence of breast self-examination was found to be 5.2%, with only 46.2% of participants performing it regularly. Factors significantly associated with the practice of BSE among women included were Good knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination (Adjusted odds ratio=4.5, 95%CI: 1.4, 14.7), high perceived susceptibility (Adjusted odds Ratio =2.7, 95%CI: 1.4, 5.2), high perceived barrier (Adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95%CI: 0.11, 0.8) and high perceived self-efficacy (Adjusted odds ratio=3.9, 95%CI: 2.0, 7.7). Conclusion: The study revealed a notably low prevalence of BSE practice among the study population compared to previous study conducted in Ethiopia. Factors such as knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination, high perceived susceptibility, and high perceived self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of BSE practice. To address this issue, collaboration and efforts from various stakeholders including Zonal Health department, District health offices, Health workers, and other relevant parties are needed. It is crucial to focus on raising awareness and improving the perception of women regarding BSE to enhance the currently inadequate practice.\nCitySEIRCast: An Agent-Based City Digital Twin for Pandemic Analysis and Simulation\nAuthors: Bilal, S.; Zaatour, W.; Alonso Otano, Y.; Saha, A.; Newcomb, K.; Kim, S.; Kim, J.; Groen, D.; Michael, E.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300481\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics that take specific accounts of the population and spatial heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world communities. Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogens transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic.

J.; Malloum, K. B.; Cantalino, J.; Signor, C.; Leclerc, P.; Bergeron, G.; Mercure, S.-A.; Cadieux, G.\nScore: 154.2, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300022\nBackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [\u0026ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects which are not assessed within the current regulatory framework.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs -- overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs were similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (3.03 (1.29-7.09) [0.6% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.

Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections.

MeaningDespite the low risk of adverse events, the results suggest that mRNA vaccines increase the risk of severe adverse events. However, given the low risk of COVID-19 infection in children, this is relevant to consider. The results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping among adults in England.

DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey.

SettingEngland.

Participants179,725 adults ([&amp;ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023.

Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod).

ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively).

ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults.

What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people.
C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use.
C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping.
C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day.
C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

        <p class="abstract">While real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendall&#39;s tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendall&#39;s tau=0.40, p&lt;0.01), HPC (Kendall&#39;s tau=0.20, p&lt;0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendall&#39;s tau=0.30, p&lt;0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p&lt;0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionSyria has experienced over a decade of armed conflict, characterized by targeted violence against healthcare. The impacts of these attacks have resulted in both direct and indirect attacks on the health system and reverberating effects on local communities. This study aims to explore the perspectives of health workers based in northern Syria who have experienced such attacks on health to understand the impacts on the health system as well as communities served.

MethodsIn-depth interviews were conducted with health workers in the northern regions of Syria where attacks on health have been frequent. Participants were identified using purposive and snowball sampling. Interviews were coded and analyzed using the Framework Method. Our inductive and deductive codes aligned closely with the WHO Health System Building Blocks framework, and we therefore integrated this framing into the presentation of findings. We actively sought to include female and non-physician health workers as both groups have been under-represented in previous research in northern Syria.

ResultsA total of 40 health workers (32.5% female, 77.5% non-physicians) who experienced attacks in northern Syria between 2013 and 2020 participated in interviews in 2020-2021. Participants characterized attacks on healthcare as frequent, persistent over years and strategically targeted. The attacks had both direct and indirect impacts on the health system and consequently the wider health of the community. For the health system, participants noted compounded impacts on the delivery of care, health system governance, and challenges to financing, workforce, and infrastructure. Reconstructing health facilities or planning services in the aftermath of attacks on health was challenging due to poor health system governance and resource challenges. These impacts had ripple effects on the health of the community, particularly the most vulnerable.

DiscussionThe impacts of attacks on health in Syria are multiple, with both short- and long-term consequences for the health system(s) across Syria as well as the health of communities in these respective areas. Though such attacks against healthcare are illegal under international humanitarian law, this and other legal frameworks have led to little accountability in the face of such attacks both in Syria and elsewhere. Characterizing their impacts is essential to improving our understanding of the consequences of attacks as a public health issue and supporting protection and advocacy efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction:  Breast self-examination is a straightforward, affordable, and uncomplicated approach to identify any alteration in the breast. When conducted correctly, it aids in the early detection of breast cancer and diminishes its impact on health and mortality. It is advised that women aged 20 and above perform self-examinations monthly, consistently. However, the extent of breast self-examination practices in Ethiopia has not been thoroughly documented. Objective: The aim of the study is to identify predictors of breast self-examination practices and associated factors among women aged 20 and above in Sidama Region, South Ethiopia. Methods : -A Cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 women aged 20-70 years. The study employed a multistage sampling method. Data collection was performed using a structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaire.  The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population in relation to relevant variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. Variables with p-value &lt;0.25 were considered as candidates for multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was declared at P &lt; 0.05 and 95% CI. Result:-The prevalence of breast self-examination was found to be 5.2%, with only 46.2% of participants performing it regularly. Factors significantly associated with the practice of BSE among women included were Good knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination (Adjusted odds ratio=4.5, 95%CI: 1.4, 14.7), high perceived susceptibility (Adjusted odds Ratio =2.7, 95%CI: 1.4, 5.2), high perceived barrier (Adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95%CI: 0.11, 0.8) and high perceived self-efficacy (Adjusted odds ratio=3.9, 95%CI: 2.0, 7.7). Conclusion: The study revealed a notably low prevalence of BSE practice among the study population compared to previous study conducted in Ethiopia. Factors such as knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination, high perceived susceptibility, and high perceived self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of BSE practice.  To address this issue, collaboration and efforts from various stakeholders including Zonal Health department, District health offices, Health workers, and other relevant parties are needed. It is crucial to focus on raising awareness and improving the perception of women regarding BSE to enhance the currently inadequate practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics that take specific accounts of the population and spatial heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world communities. Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogens transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization.

MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [&amp;ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress.

ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6).

InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.</p>
