B.; Chiwaula, M.; Chavula, Y.; Bukhu, M.; Manda, H.; Chitenje, M.; Malolo, I.; Mwanyongo, A.; Mvula, B.; Nyenje, M.; de Oliveira, T.; Kagoli, M.\nScore: 59.7, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294324\nSince early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.\nSARS-CoV-2 quarantine mandated by contact tracing: burden and infection rate among close contacts in Zurich, Switzerland, 2020-2021\nAuthors: Aschmann, H. E.; Domenghino, A.; Jung, R.; Ballouz, T.; Menges, D.; Fehr, J.; Puhan, M. A.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294798\nObjectivesBefore vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MethodsWe invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests, during and at the end of quarantine. ResultsAmong 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%-14.7%] were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported quarantine was very or extremely difficult. ConclusionsAlthough quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.\nAssessing the Economic Burden of Alcohol Use in India Compared to Excise Taxes on Alcohol Sales\nAuthors: Zadey, S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295088\nBackgroundAlcohol use is among the topmost public health risk factors. There is a dearth of evidence on the broader impact of alcohol use on society, especially, for lower-middle-income countries like India. We retrospectively studied the economic burden of alcohol use and compared it with revenue from excise taxes on alcohol sales for India and its states in 2019. MethodsFor estimating the overall alcohol-attributable disease burden, disability-adjusted life-years or DALYs for India and its 30 states were extracted for all causes, all age groups, and both sexes with alcohol use as a risk factor from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study. Economic burden was calculated by the value of life-year (VLY) or full-income approach. National and state-level (top 10 revenue-earning states) data on excise taxes on alcohol sales were acquired from the Reserve Bank of India. Net losses were assessed by subtracting the revenue from the economic burden. All values are in Indian rupees (INR). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different discount rates (0%, 3%, and 7%) for VLY values while uncertainty was propagated using 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for DALYs. ResultsThe economic burden of alcohol use in India was 6.2 (95% UI: 4.8, 7.8) trillion INR in 2019. State-level burden varied from 7.3 (4.7, 10.4) billion INR in Mizoram to 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) trillion INR in Maharashtra. Nationally, revenue was 1.8 trillion INR depicting a net loss of 4.4 (3.1, 6.0) trillion. Net loss was largest in Maharashtra and smallest in Telangana. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that all ten states depicted losses in the case of a 3% discount rate, while five and seven states showed losses at 0% and 7% discount rates. ConclusionThese are novel subnational estimates depicting annual net losses due to alcohol use in India with direct policy implications to disincentivize alcohol sales and raise taxes to an adequate level. HighlightsO_LIThe annual economic burden of alcohol use in India runs over six trillion rupees. C_LIO_LIEconomic burden exceeds revenue from excise taxes noting net loss. C_LIO_LIEconomic burden varies across states with Maharashtra having the largest burden. C_LIO_LIAll of the top ten revenue-earning states depict net losses in primary analysis.

M.; Sharma, H.; Mishra, S.; Singh, G.; Rao, S.; Borle, A.; Anand, T.; Kumar, N.; Goswami, B.; Singh, S.; Kapoor, M.; Singla, S.; Khuraijam, B.; Khurana, N.; Sharma, U.; Garg, S.\nScore: 41.9, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294654\nBackgroundPost-coronavirus disease (COVID) is widely reported but the data of Post COVID-19 after infection with the Omicron variant is limited. This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (\u003e18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 {+/-}54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57{+/-}48.33), shortness of breath (131.89{+/-}60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59{+/-}58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.\nIndividual and spatial determinants of mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic: The case of Belgium in 2020\nAuthors: Bourguignon, M.; Bertrand, A.; Damiens, J.; Doignon, Y.; Eggerickx, T.; Plavsic, A.; Sanderson, J.-P.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.23295014\nContextThe year 2020 was marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. In Belgium, it led to a doubling in deaths, mainly grouped into two periods. This article aims to compare the relative importance of predictors and individual and spatial determinants of mortality during these two waves to an equivalent non-pandemic period and to identify whether and to what extent the pandemic has altered the sociodemographic patterns of conventional mortality. MethodsThe analyses relate to all-cause mortality during the two waves of Covid-19 and their equivalent in 2019. They are based on matching individual and exhaustive data from the Belgian National Register with tax and population census data. A multi-level approach was adopted combining individual and spatial determinants. ResultsMortality patterns during the pandemic are very similar to those observed outside the pandemic. As in 2019, age, sex, and household composition significantly determine the individual risk of dying, with a higher risk of death among the oldest people, men, and residents of collective households. However, their risk of death increases during the Covid period, especially in the 65-79 age group. Spatial information is no more significant in 2020 than in 2019. However, a higher risk of death is observed when the local excess mortality index or the proportions of isolated or disadvantaged people increase. ConclusionsWhile the Covid pandemic did not fundamentally alter conventional mortality patterns, it did amplify some of the pre-existing differences in mortality.\nPastoral (im)mobility and zoonotic disease: a qualitative participatory study in Plateau State, Nigeria\nAuthors: Braam, D. H.; Bolajoko, M.-B.; Hammer, C. C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294938\nBackgroundIn Plateau State, pastoralism has historically been a cost effective and resilient economic system well-suited to the ecological context. However, changes in land use and conflict have increasingly changed patterns of mobility. Pastoralist movement is now often associated with zoonotic disease transmission, environmental degradation and conflict, increasingly resulting in forced sedentarisation. Rather than a direct outcome of population movement however, zoonotic disease drivers are complex and influenced by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. The interlinkages of (im)mobility and zoonotic health requires better understanding of underlying vulnerabilities to disease, which we aim to address in this study. MethodsUsing a multisite case study methodology we investigated pastoralists zoonotic health concerns and priorities in Plateau State, Nigeria. We deployed participatory tools, including open-ended Focus Group Discussions, transect walks, mapping exercises, calendars and matrices. Data were analysed using a One Health conceptual framework. ResultsWe interviewed 105 participants, from transhumance, migratory and sedentary households, dependent on livestock and small-scale crops. While transhumance was often preferred, participants had become sedentary as a result of insecurity, loss in livestock, and household characteristics. Humans and animals suffered from several endemic diseases, including zoonoses, however veterinary and human health services are only available in larger towns, and people mostly rely on community (animal) health workers and self-medication. Both transhumance and sedentary livestock keepers face challenges around forage grazing, regularly blocked by landowners, sometimes escalating into conflict. ConclusionsWhile conflict and changes in land use affected animal and human disease patterns, underlying political, social and economic risk factors were important determinants of health. There is a need for more inclusive, transdisciplinary, multilevel approaches to address neglected zoonoses, based on better contextualization of the challenges, through the participation of affected communities. ImpactsO_LIThis study uses participatory approaches to investigate the under researched area of mobility and zoonotic disease dynamics. C_LIO_LIWe found that animal and human mobility may mitigate or exacerbate zoonotic disease risk, impacting conflict, in turn leading to forced migration. C_LIO_LISecurity challenges need to be addressed simultaneously with mitigating structural inequality, through increasing pastoral social and economic capital, increase access to grazing routes and water, secure land tenure arrangements, and the provision of (veterinary) public health to reduce zoonotic disease risks for the wider population.

R.; Khadilkar, A. V.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294810\nIntroductionNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a significant health burden in India, with preventable risk factors contributing to their prevalence. Intergenerational inequities can exacerbate the transmission of health risks to further disadvantage vulnerable populations. Taking a life course perspective, this multi-generational cohort study aims to investigate behavioural, socio-ecological, and socio-economic determinants of growth and NCD risk, as well as healthcare access and utilization among rural households that include preadolescent children and their parents. MethodsThe study is being implemented by Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute (HCJMRI) utilizing a prospective multi-generational cohort design to investigate NCD risk across 15 years. Data are being collected from 12 villages around Pune, Maharashtra, India. The primary population enrolled includes apparently asymptomatic (i.e., healthy) children aged 8 to 10 years and their parents. The sample size calculation (N=1300 children) for this longitudinal prospective cohort was driven by the primary objective of assessing trajectories of growth and NCD incidence across generations. A total of 2099 children aged 6 to 10 years have been screened since April 2022, of whom 1471 have been found to be eligible for inclusion in the study. After obtaining informed consent from parents and their children, comprehensive bi-annual data are being collected from both children and parents, including clinical, behavioural, healthcare access and utilization as well as socio-ecological and socio-economic determinants of health. Participants (children and their parents) are being enrolled through household visits, and by arranging subsequent visits to the primary health facility of HCJMRI. Clinical assessments include anthropometric measurements, blood samples for a wide range of NCD indicators, bone health, and muscle function. The long-term data analysis plan includes longitudinal modeling, time-series analyses, structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, and sex and gender-based analyses. Ethics approval has been obtained from the institutional ethics committee, the Ethics Committee Jehangir Clinical Development Centre Pvt Ltd. Written informed consent is obtained from adults and written informed assent from children. DiscussionAs of May 2023, 378 families from 10 villages have been enrolled, including 432 preadolescents and 756 parents. Preliminary results not only highlight the double burden of malnutrition in the cohort with undernutrition and overweight/obesity coexisting among children and parents, respectively but also identify high rates of diabetes and hypertension among adults in rural areas. Findings can inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce NCDs, address intergenerational health inequities, and improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations.\nWastewater-based surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus epidemic at the national level in Finland\nAuthors: Länsivaara, A. I.; Lehto, K.-M.; Hyder, R.; Luomala, O.; Lipponen, A.; Hokajärvi, A.-M.; Heikinheimo, A.; Pitkänen, T.; Oikarinen, S.; WastPan study group, Score: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.23295011\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of wastewater-based surveillance in the monitoring of epidemics at the national level in Finland. To discover the correlation of wastewater data and register data, the 2021-2022 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic in Finland was analyzed from wastewater and the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The study was performed using samples that were collected monthly from May 2021 to July 2022 from ten wastewater treatment plants that cover 40% of the Finnish population. Respiratory syncytial virus detection in 24-h composite samples of influent wastewater was performed using RT-qPCR. Respiratory syncytial virus wastewater data were positively correlated with the National Infectious Diseases Register data for the sampling week (correlation coefficient, CC min = 0.412, max = 0.865). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of respiratory syncytial virus from the sampling week to three weeks afterward was strongly correlated with the wastewater data (CC min = 0.482, max = 0.814), showing the potential of wastewater-based surveillance for use in estimating the course of the epidemic. When the register-based incidence of RSV was at least four cases/100,000 persons/week in the sampling week, it was detected in all wastewater samples. This study showed that wastewater surveillance is useful in the surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics, and its potential in the surveillance of other epidemics should be explored further. SynopsisEnvironmental surveillance has been previously used to monitor viruses such as poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2. This study shows that wastewater-based surveillance can be used to surveil the respiratory syncytial virus and its epidemics, at a national level.\nBivalent mRNA vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in Portugal: a cohort study based on electronic health records, September 2022 to May 2023\nAuthors: Machado, A.; Kislaya, I.; Soares, P.; Magalhaes, S.; Rodrigues, A. P.; Franco, R.; Leite, P. P.; Dias, C. M.; Nunes, B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295025\nIn Portugal, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster was recommended for those with complete primary COVID-19 vaccination, starting on September 6 2022. This study aims to estimate the mRNA bivalent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death in the Portuguese population aged 65 and more years with a follow-up of more than six months. MethodsWe used a cohort approach to analyse six electronic health registries using deterministic linkage. The follow-up period comprehend September 2022 to May 2023. The outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. Individuals were considered vaccinated 14 days following a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine uptake. For each outcome, COVID-19 bivalent VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio of bivalent vaccine vs no bivalent vaccine, estimated by Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure. ResultsIn the [\u0026ge;] 80 year-olds, bivalent VE was 23.2 (95%CI: 20.1 to 26.2), 41.3 (95%CI: 34.5 to 47.5) and 50.3 (44.6 to 55.3), against infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, respectively. In the 65-79 year-old, bivalent VE against infection was 37.7 (35.5 to 39.8), 58.5 (95%CI: 51.9 to 64.2) against hospitalisation and 65.1 (95%CI: 59 to 70.4) against death. Vaccine effectiveness decay was observed for both age groups and in all outcomes, up to 6 months of vaccine uptake. ConclusionsIn a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed moderate bivalent VE estimates against severe COVID-19 and low protection against infection. The lower VE estimates observed in the [\u0026ge;] 80 year-olds should be interpreted in light of the reference group used for the estimation, i.e., individuals with high vaccine coverage (both primary series and multiple boosters). Significant VE decay was observed up to six months of vaccine uptake, which should be considered when preparing future vaccination campaigns.\nElucidating the Dynamics and Impact of the Gut Microbiome on Maternal Nutritional Status During Pregnancy in Rural Pakistan. Study Protocol for a Prospective, Longitudinal Observational Study.\nAuthors: Wasan, Y.; Baxter, J.-A. B.; Spiegel-Feld, C.; Begum, K.; Rizvi, A.; Iqbal, J.; Hulst, J. M.; Bandsma, R.; Suleman, S.; Soofi, S. B.; Parkinson, J.; Bhutta, Z. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295048\nBackground: Nutritional status critically contributes to maternal and child morbidities and mortality. Undernutrition during pregnancy and preconception is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and has downstream effects on the growth and development of children. The gut microbiome has a profound influence on the nutritional status of the host. Dysbiosis has emerged as a major factor in the development of malnutrition. This phenomenon is understudied in settings with a high prevalence of undernutrition, and further investigation is warranted to better understand such interactions. Methods: The study is a prospective, longitudinal observational study to investigate the impact and relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the gut and their association with maternal health and birth outcomes among young women, 17-24 years of age in Matiari District, Pakistan. We aim to enroll 400 pregnant women with low and normal BMI at the time of recruitment (\u003c16 weeks of gestation). Data collection includes demographics, morbidities, medication use, empowerment, dietary recall, and anthropometrics. Stool and blood specimens are collected at several time points for different laboratory assays. Discussion: Limited studies have examined the role of the microbiome in maternal health and birth outcomes where the prevalence of undernutrition is high. Here we aim to investigate the interplay of maternal and child undernutrition with the composition (diversity) and functionality of the gut microbiome and capture how it is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the understanding of undernutrition. Study registration: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05108675. Keywords: Maternal, Infant, BMI, Gut Microbiome, Dysbiosis, and Pregnancy Outcomes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Since early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesBefore vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests, during and at the end of quarantine.

ResultsAmong 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%-14.7%] were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported quarantine was very or extremely difficult.

ConclusionsAlthough quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlcohol use is among the topmost public health risk factors. There is a dearth of evidence on the broader impact of alcohol use on society, especially, for lower-middle-income countries like India. We retrospectively studied the economic burden of alcohol use and compared it with revenue from excise taxes on alcohol sales for India and its states in 2019.

MethodsFor estimating the overall alcohol-attributable disease burden, disability-adjusted life-years or DALYs for India and its 30 states were extracted for all causes, all age groups, and both sexes with alcohol use as a risk factor from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study. Economic burden was calculated by the value of life-year (VLY) or full-income approach. National and state-level (top 10 revenue-earning states) data on excise taxes on alcohol sales were acquired from the Reserve Bank of India. Net losses were assessed by subtracting the revenue from the economic burden. All values are in Indian rupees (INR). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different discount rates (0%, 3%, and 7%) for VLY values while uncertainty was propagated using 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for DALYs.

ResultsThe economic burden of alcohol use in India was 6.2 (95% UI: 4.8, 7.8) trillion INR in 2019. State-level burden varied from 7.3 (4.7, 10.4) billion INR in Mizoram to 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) trillion INR in Maharashtra. Nationally, revenue was 1.8 trillion INR depicting a net loss of 4.4 (3.1, 6.0) trillion. Net loss was largest in Maharashtra and smallest in Telangana. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that all ten states depicted losses in the case of a 3% discount rate, while five and seven states showed losses at 0% and 7% discount rates.

ConclusionThese are novel subnational estimates depicting annual net losses due to alcohol use in India with direct policy implications to disincentivize alcohol sales and raise taxes to an adequate level.

HighlightsO_LIThe annual economic burden of alcohol use in India runs over six trillion rupees.
C_LIO_LIEconomic burden exceeds revenue from excise taxes noting net loss.
C_LIO_LIEconomic burden varies across states with Maharashtra having the largest burden.
C_LIO_LIAll of the top ten revenue-earning states depict net losses in primary analysis.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-coronavirus disease (COVID) is widely reported but the data of Post COVID-19 after infection with the Omicron variant is limited. This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (&gt;18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 {&#43;/-}54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57{&#43;/-}48.33), shortness of breath (131.89{&#43;/-}60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59{&#43;/-}58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ContextThe year 2020 was marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. In Belgium, it led to a doubling in deaths, mainly grouped into two periods. This article aims to compare the relative importance of predictors and individual and spatial determinants of mortality during these two waves to an equivalent non-pandemic period and to identify whether and to what extent the pandemic has altered the sociodemographic patterns of conventional mortality.

MethodsThe analyses relate to all-cause mortality during the two waves of Covid-19 and their equivalent in 2019. They are based on matching individual and exhaustive data from the Belgian National Register with tax and population census data. A multi-level approach was adopted combining individual and spatial determinants.

ResultsMortality patterns during the pandemic are very similar to those observed outside the pandemic. As in 2019, age, sex, and household composition significantly determine the individual risk of dying, with a higher risk of death among the oldest people, men, and residents of collective households. However, their risk of death increases during the Covid period, especially in the 65-79 age group. Spatial information is no more significant in 2020 than in 2019. However, a higher risk of death is observed when the local excess mortality index or the proportions of isolated or disadvantaged people increase.

ConclusionsWhile the Covid pandemic did not fundamentally alter conventional mortality patterns, it did amplify some of the pre-existing differences in mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn Plateau State, pastoralism has historically been a cost effective and resilient economic system well-suited to the ecological context. However, changes in land use and conflict have increasingly changed patterns of mobility. Pastoralist movement is now often associated with zoonotic disease transmission, environmental degradation and conflict, increasingly resulting in forced sedentarisation. Rather than a direct outcome of population movement however, zoonotic disease drivers are complex and influenced by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. The interlinkages of (im)mobility and zoonotic health requires better understanding of underlying vulnerabilities to disease, which we aim to address in this study.

MethodsUsing a multisite case study methodology we investigated pastoralists zoonotic health concerns and priorities in Plateau State, Nigeria. We deployed participatory tools, including open-ended Focus Group Discussions, transect walks, mapping exercises, calendars and matrices. Data were analysed using a One Health conceptual framework.

ResultsWe interviewed 105 participants, from transhumance, migratory and sedentary households, dependent on livestock and small-scale crops. While transhumance was often preferred, participants had become sedentary as a result of insecurity, loss in livestock, and household characteristics. Humans and animals suffered from several endemic diseases, including zoonoses, however veterinary and human health services are only available in larger towns, and people mostly rely on community (animal) health workers and self-medication. Both transhumance and sedentary livestock keepers face challenges around forage grazing, regularly blocked by landowners, sometimes escalating into conflict.

ConclusionsWhile conflict and changes in land use affected animal and human disease patterns, underlying political, social and economic risk factors were important determinants of health. There is a need for more inclusive, transdisciplinary, multilevel approaches to address neglected zoonoses, based on better contextualization of the challenges, through the participation of affected communities.

ImpactsO_LIThis study uses participatory approaches to investigate the under researched area of mobility and zoonotic disease dynamics.
C_LIO_LIWe found that animal and human mobility may mitigate or exacerbate zoonotic disease risk, impacting conflict, in turn leading to forced migration.
C_LIO_LISecurity challenges need to be addressed simultaneously with mitigating structural inequality, through increasing pastoral social and economic capital, increase access to grazing routes and water, secure land tenure arrangements, and the provision of (veterinary) public health to reduce zoonotic disease risks for the wider population.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a significant health burden in India, with preventable risk factors contributing to their prevalence. Intergenerational inequities can exacerbate the transmission of health risks to further disadvantage vulnerable populations. Taking a life course perspective, this multi-generational cohort study aims to investigate behavioural, socio-ecological, and socio-economic determinants of growth and NCD risk, as well as healthcare access and utilization among rural households that include preadolescent children and their parents.

MethodsThe study is being implemented by Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute (HCJMRI) utilizing a prospective multi-generational cohort design to investigate NCD risk across 15 years. Data are being collected from 12 villages around Pune, Maharashtra, India. The primary population enrolled includes apparently asymptomatic (i.e., healthy) children aged 8 to 10 years and their parents.

The sample size calculation (N=1300 children) for this longitudinal prospective cohort was driven by the primary objective of assessing trajectories of growth and NCD incidence across generations. A total of 2099 children aged 6 to 10 years have been screened since April 2022, of whom 1471 have been found to be eligible for inclusion in the study. After obtaining informed consent from parents and their children, comprehensive bi-annual data are being collected from both children and parents, including clinical, behavioural, healthcare access and utilization as well as socio-ecological and socio-economic determinants of health. Participants (children and their parents) are being enrolled through household visits, and by arranging subsequent visits to the primary health facility of HCJMRI. Clinical assessments include anthropometric measurements, blood samples for a wide range of NCD indicators, bone health, and muscle function. The long-term data analysis plan includes longitudinal modeling, time-series analyses, structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, and sex and gender-based analyses.

Ethics approval has been obtained from the institutional ethics committee, the Ethics Committee Jehangir Clinical Development Centre Pvt Ltd. Written informed consent is obtained from adults and written informed assent from children.

DiscussionAs of May 2023, 378 families from 10 villages have been enrolled, including 432 preadolescents and 756 parents. Preliminary results not only highlight the double burden of malnutrition in the cohort with undernutrition and overweight/obesity coexisting among children and parents, respectively but also identify high rates of diabetes and hypertension among adults in rural areas. Findings can inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce NCDs, address intergenerational health inequities, and improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of wastewater-based surveillance in the monitoring of epidemics at the national level in Finland. To discover the correlation of wastewater data and register data, the 2021-2022 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic in Finland was analyzed from wastewater and the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The study was performed using samples that were collected monthly from May 2021 to July 2022 from ten wastewater treatment plants that cover 40% of the Finnish population. Respiratory syncytial virus detection in 24-h composite samples of influent wastewater was performed using RT-qPCR. Respiratory syncytial virus wastewater data were positively correlated with the National Infectious Diseases Register data for the sampling week (correlation coefficient, CC min = 0.412, max = 0.865). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of respiratory syncytial virus from the sampling week to three weeks afterward was strongly correlated with the wastewater data (CC min = 0.482, max = 0.814), showing the potential of wastewater-based surveillance for use in estimating the course of the epidemic. When the register-based incidence of RSV was at least four cases/100,000 persons/week in the sampling week, it was detected in all wastewater samples. This study showed that wastewater surveillance is useful in the surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics, and its potential in the surveillance of other epidemics should be explored further.

SynopsisEnvironmental surveillance has been previously used to monitor viruses such as poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2. This study shows that wastewater-based surveillance can be used to surveil the respiratory syncytial virus and its epidemics, at a national level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Portugal, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster was recommended for those with complete primary COVID-19 vaccination, starting on September 6 2022. This study aims to estimate the mRNA bivalent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death in the Portuguese population aged 65 and more years with a follow-up of more than six months.

MethodsWe used a cohort approach to analyse six electronic health registries using deterministic linkage. The follow-up period comprehend September 2022 to May 2023. The outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. Individuals were considered vaccinated 14 days following a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine uptake. For each outcome, COVID-19 bivalent VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio of bivalent vaccine vs no bivalent vaccine, estimated by Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure.

ResultsIn the [&amp;ge;] 80 year-olds, bivalent VE was 23.2 (95%CI: 20.1 to 26.2), 41.3 (95%CI: 34.5 to 47.5) and 50.3 (44.6 to 55.3), against infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, respectively. In the 65-79 year-old, bivalent VE against infection was 37.7 (35.5 to 39.8), 58.5 (95%CI: 51.9 to 64.2) against hospitalisation and 65.1 (95%CI: 59 to 70.4) against death. Vaccine effectiveness decay was observed for both age groups and in all outcomes, up to 6 months of vaccine uptake.

ConclusionsIn a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed moderate bivalent VE estimates against severe COVID-19 and low protection against infection. The lower VE estimates observed in the [&amp;ge;] 80 year-olds should be interpreted in light of the reference group used for the estimation, i.e., individuals with high vaccine coverage (both primary series and multiple boosters). Significant VE decay was observed up to six months of vaccine uptake, which should be considered when preparing future vaccination campaigns.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Nutritional status critically contributes to maternal and child morbidities and mortality. Undernutrition during pregnancy and preconception is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and has downstream effects on the growth and development of children. The gut microbiome has a profound influence on the nutritional status of the host. Dysbiosis has emerged as a major factor in the development of malnutrition. This phenomenon is understudied in settings with a high prevalence of undernutrition, and further investigation is warranted to better understand such interactions. Methods: The study is a prospective, longitudinal observational study to investigate the impact and relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the gut and their association with maternal health and birth outcomes among young women, 17-24 years of age in Matiari District, Pakistan. We aim to enroll 400 pregnant women with low and normal BMI at the time of recruitment (&lt;16 weeks of gestation). Data collection includes demographics, morbidities, medication use, empowerment, dietary recall, and anthropometrics. Stool and blood specimens are collected at several time points for different laboratory assays. Discussion: Limited studies have examined the role of the microbiome in maternal health and birth outcomes where the prevalence of undernutrition is high. Here we aim to investigate the interplay of maternal and child undernutrition with the composition (diversity) and functionality of the gut microbiome and capture how it is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the understanding of undernutrition. Study registration: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05108675. Keywords: Maternal, Infant, BMI, Gut Microbiome, Dysbiosis, and Pregnancy Outcomes.</p>
