Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization. ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [\u0026ge;]7 days after the second dose. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.\nPreparedness in practice: An outbreak science approach to studying public health emergency response\nAuthors: Moore, M.; Robertson, H.; Rosado, D.; Graeden, E.; Carlson, C. J.; Katz, R.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291861\nOutbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.\nA unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk\nAuthors: Jermy, B.; Läll, K.; Wolford, B.

To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.\nAssociation of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States, 2022-2023\nAuthors: Packard, S. E.; Susser, E.\nScore: 120.1, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290930\nObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States. MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms \u003e 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.\nCovid-19 Excess Mortality in China: A Regional Comparison\nAuthors: LIU, L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291443\nEstimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but lower than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.\nRegime type and Data Manipulation: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Wigley, S.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.11.22283310\nAutocratic and democratic leaders have an incentive to misreport data that may reveal policy failure. However, it is easier for autocratic leaders to fabricate data because they are not subject to scrutiny from media, opposition parties, and civil society. This suggests that autocratic governments are more likely to manipulate policy-relevant statistics than democratic governments. It is inherently difficult to test that claim because researchers typically do not have access to data from sources other than the government. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between regime type and data manipulation because of its widespread impact, as well as the ability to compare reported with excess deaths and test for statistical anomalies in reported data. Based on regressions for undercounting and statistical irregularities that take into account unintentional mismeasurement, I find that autocratic governments are more likely to deliberately under-report the impact of COVID-19 than their democratic counterparts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Outbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States.

MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms &gt; 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but lower than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autocratic and democratic leaders have an incentive to misreport data that may reveal policy failure. However, it is easier for autocratic leaders to fabricate data because they are not subject to scrutiny from media, opposition parties, and civil society. This suggests that autocratic governments are more likely to manipulate policy-relevant statistics than democratic governments. It is inherently difficult to test that claim because researchers typically do not have access to data from sources other than the government. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between regime type and data manipulation because of its widespread impact, as well as the ability to compare reported with excess deaths and test for statistical anomalies in reported data. Based on regressions for undercounting and statistical irregularities that take into account unintentional mismeasurement, I find that autocratic governments are more likely to deliberately under-report the impact of COVID-19 than their democratic counterparts.</p>
