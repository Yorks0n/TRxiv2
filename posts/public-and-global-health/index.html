There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission. MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties. ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19. ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.\nTrade unions and mental health during an employment crisis. Evidence from the UK before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAuthors: Kromydas, T.; Demou, E.; Leyland, A. H.; Katikireddi, S. V.; Wels, J.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297780\nBackgroundTrade union presence within a workplace could potentially affect employees working conditions and in turn health. We assessed the relationship between union (presence and membership) at the individual level and mental health in the context of COVID-19 employment disruptions. MethodsWe analysed panel data from Understanding Society collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (49,915 observations across 5,988 respondents) to assess the relationship between union presence and membership and a validated epidemiological measure of common mental disorders (CMD), the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire with a score of \u003e/4 indicating probable anxiety/depression, referred to as caseness. A mixed-effect log-linear model assessed effect heterogeneity across time and industries, with average marginal effects (AME) indicating effect differences between groups. FindingsIn our sample, 49.1% worked in a unionised workplace, among which 53.8% were union members. Caseness prevalence was higher during the pandemic (25.4%) compared to pre-pandemic (18.4%). Working in a workplace with a trade union was associated with modest protection against CMD risk; (AMEpre-pandemic:0.010, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.027), (AME- pandemic:-0.002, 95%CI:-0.019; 0.016)]. Similarly, for union membership [(AMEpre- pandemic:0.016, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.039), (AMEpandemic:-0.010, 95%CI:-0.023; 0.020)]. Industry level heterogeneity exists in the relationship between union presence and membership and mental health. InterpretationTrade union presence may have a protective effect on workers mental health in periods of crisis, such as during a pandemic. Within unionised workplaces, trade union membership further mitigated the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. Collective negotiation within workplaces may be protective in periods of uncertainty, benefiting all workers and not only those unionised.

S.; Hong, V.; Holmquist, K. J.; Qian, L.; Farrington, P.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Klein, N. P.; Fireman, B.; Han, B.; Lewin, B. J.\nScore: 155.5, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPsychosocial vulnerabilities in newly arrived asylum seekers to the Greek island of Lesvos: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis\nAuthors: Veizis, A.; Kavarnos, G.; Bressaglia, M.; Norredam, M.; Hargreaves, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297929\nBackgroundKara Tepe Registration and Identification Camp on Lesvos Island in Greece is a controlled access facility with people in various stages of the asylum procedure housed in tents, rub halls and containers in poor living conditions for prolonged periods of time. However, data are lacking on psychosocial vulnerabilities and experiences of these populations, particularly the growing number of single women residing in these settings.We aimed to explore psychosocial needs among this incamped population. MethodsWe did a retrospective cross-sectional chart review of sociodemographic and psychosocial vulnerabilities of all migrants (\u003e18 years of age) who were detained in Kara Tepe between 1st February 2021 and 31st January 2023. Data were extracted from the Knack Online Database used by INTERSOS HELLAS. Results701 individuals were referred to the clinic for psychosocial work-up over a 2 year follow-up period, of which 165 subsequently received psychological support after initial health assessments. The majority (92.0%) of the cohort were women who were single, most from Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo, and Syria, with a range of medical and social vulnerabilities. 19.8% of the population had been subjected to gender-based violence including in their country of origin, during the migration route to Lesvos, or while on the island of Lesvos. The most common GBV incident reported was rape (48.9%) followed by physical assault (23.7%) and non-penetrative sexual assault (21.5%). 7% of the population presented with suicidal, or self-harming, behaviour, of which 26.2% had attempted suicide. ConclusionThis study highlights for the first time the stark range of vulnerabilities experienced by predominantly single women in camp settings in Greece.\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S.

A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; H\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nRegional variation and epidemiological insights in malaria underestimation in Cameroon\nAuthors: Iyaniwura, S. A.; Han, Q.; Yong, N. B.; Rutayisire, G.; Adom-Konadu, A.; Mbah, O. P.; Tchouassi, D. P.; Badu, K.; Kong, J. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298167\nMalaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, is most common in tropical regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite significant global effort to control and eradicate the disease, many cases and deaths are still reported yearly. These efforts are hindered by several factors, including the severe underestimation of cases and deaths, especially in Africa, making it difficult to assess the disease burden accurately. We used a mathematical model of malaria, incorporating the underestimation of cases and seasonality in mosquito biting rate, to study the disease dynamics in Cameroon. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrated our model to the monthly reported malaria cases in ten regions of Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021 to quantify the underestimation of cases and estimate other important epidemiological parameters. We performed Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components analysis to understand regional disparities, looking at underestimation rates, population sizes, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities per 1,000 people. We found varying levels of underestimation of cases across regions, with the East region having the lowest underestimation (14%) and the Northwest region with the highest (70%). The mosquito biting rate peaks once every year in most of the regions, except in the Northwest region where it peaks every 6.02 months and in Littoral every 15 months. We estimated a median mosquito biting rate of over five bites per day for most of the regions with Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). Two regions have rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day). The notably low estimation of malaria cases in Cameroon underscore the pressing requirement to bolster reporting and surveillance systems. Regions in Cameroon display a range of unique features, which may contribute to the differing levels of malaria underestimation. These distinctions should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of community-based interventions.\nDo children with disabilities have the same opportunities to play as children without disabilities? Evidence from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 38 low and middle-income countries\nAuthors: Smythe, T.; Chen, S.; Rotenberg, S.; Unger, M.; Miner, E.; Seghers, F.; Kuper, H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297603\nBackgroundPlay is essential for the cognitive, social, and emotional development of all children. Disparities potentially exist in access to play for children with disabilities, and the extent of this inequity is unknown. MethodsData from 212,194 children aged 2-4 years in 38 Low and Middle-Income Countries were collected in the UNICEF supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017 - 2020). Disability was assessed by the Washington Group-Child Functioning Module. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between disability and play opportunities, controlling for age, sex, and wealth status. Meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates (overall, and disaggregated by sex), with heterogeneity assessed by Cochrans Q test. FindingsChildren with disabilities have approximately 9% fewer play opportunities than those without disabilities (adjusted RR [aRR] =0.88, 95%CI=0.82-0.93), and this varied across countries. Mongolia and Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe had the lowest likelihood of play opportunities for children with disabilities ((aRR=0.26,95%CI=0.09-0.75; aRR=0.46, 95%CI=0.23-0.93, respectively). Moreover, children with disabilities are 17% less likely to be provided with opportunities to play with their mothers (aRR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.73-0.93), which is further reduced for girls with disabilities (aRR=0.74, 95% CI:0.60-0.90) compared to their peers without disabilities. The associations varied by impairment type, and children with communication and learning impairments are less likely to have opportunities for play with aRR of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.79) and 0.78 (95%CI:0.71-0.86), compared to those without disabilities, respectively. InterpretationChildren with disabilities are being left behind in their access to play and this is likely to have negative impacts on their overall development and well-being. FundingHK and TS receive funding from NIHR. The Study was funded by PENDA. SR receives funding from the Rhodes Trust. Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies reporting population-representative estimates of children with disabilities exposure to play in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) published before Feb 7th, 2023. We used the following combination of keywords: \"play\" AND (\"early childhood\" OR \"preschool\" OR \"young children\") AND (disability OR disabilities) AND \"prevalence\". We found no multi-country studies reporting the prevalence or country-level disparities (within or between countries) for opportunities for play for children with disabilities. We did not identify any studies synthesising or comparing estimates across all dimensions of play or disability, nor did we identify studies reporting population-representative estimates of play for all LMICs. UNICEF has published global reports, which reveal that children with disabilities receive less early stimulation and responsive care and have limited exposure to childrens books and toys compared to children without disabilities, however opportunities for play within the household setting have not been examined in a comprehensive analysis. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the opportunities for play for children with disabilities compared to those without across multiple countries. Moreover, it provides a large dataset on this topic including 212,194 children aged 2-4 years from 38 low and middle income countries (LMICs), including approximately 6.1% with disabilities (i.e. reporting a lot of difficulty or more in a functional domain). The study has advanced the literature in five substantive ways. First, we highlighted that children with disabilities have fewer opportunities to play, across multiple measures of play and multiple settings. Second, we demonstrated that there are disparities in play opportunities for children with disabilities across countries. Third, we showed that this varied by impairment and was worst for children with learning and communication impairments. Fourth, we showed that there was a discrepancy between girls and boys with disabilities. Finally, our work extends beyond simple description by deploying ratio ratios to provide a quantitative risk assessment. This enables us to identify areas of particular concern and suggest where interventions may be most needed. The ratio ratios shed light on the severity of disparities and pinpoint specific high-risk categories such as particular countries, types of disabilities, or population groups. This analysis is crucial for refining interventions and optimising resource allocation, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Implications of all the available evidenceThe study findings emphasise the importance of including children with disabilities in early child development programmes, and where relevant preschool, which may require modifications to ensure inclusivity. Programmes are needed that specifically target children with learning or communication impairments. This may work best through parent support programmes, as formal preschool or programmes may be lacking in LMICs. Monitoring participation is crucial for children with disabilities. To promote equal opportunities for play at home, in schools, and in other community settings, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and attitudes of parents, teachers, and caregivers, as well as implement policies that address barriers to participation. The findings underscore the urgent need for policies to reflect the inclusion of children with disabilities. Research is needed to establish evidence regarding the importance of promoting play opportunities beyond the home environment, including pre-schools, schools, and community settings. Furthermore, well-designed studies to provide affordable, timely and accessible data on effective strategies for enhancing play for children with disabilities are required. This information will enable programme developers and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on improving the lives of children with disabilities worldwide.\nIn praise of fossil fuel subsidies (for cooking)\nAuthors: Gould, C. F.; Bailis, R.; Balakrishnan, K.; Burke, M.; Espinoza, S.; Mehta, S.; Schlesinger, S.; Suarez-Lopez, J.; Pillarisetti, A.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297550\nWe use three quantitative case studies to argue that ubiquitous and universal condemnation of fossil fuel subsidies is myopic and does not adequately consider subsidizing gas for cooking as a potential strategy to improve public health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ecuador offers a view into the long-run impacts of gas subsidies, having made historical investments in subsidizing gas for cooking that led to widespread use that outpaces peer nations. We calculate that the subsidy likely averted 100,000 premature deaths with benefits that outweigh costs four to one. India successfully implemented the largest gas cooking access program in the world, but the level of subsidies provided by the government has varied. We estimate that mortality and climate benefits from maintaining varying levels of the gas subsidy between 2023-2030 will be roughly double costs. In Kenya, removing a value added tax on LPG will yield health and climate benefits that will dwarf the lost revenue by [~]30x. Waiting for existing policies and momentum to move households toward near-exclusive clean fuel use forces marginalized populations to directly face the health, environmental, and socio-economic harms of traditional cooking. Rather than wait decades for development to provide clean cooking to these households, which will deepen health and energy inequities, we suggest that targeted LPG subsidies offer a solution available today and provide immediate health and climate benefits. One-Sentence SummaryCondemnation of cooking gas subsidies lacks broader perspective, as such subsidies enable cleaner cooking and can deliver health and climate benefits.\nDisability Documentation in the National Health Interview Survey and Its Consequence: Comparing the American Community Survey to the Washington Group Disability Measures\nAuthors: Landes, S.; Swenor, B. K.; Vaitsiakhovich, N.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297081\nBackground and Objective.The objective of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is to provide data that can be used to monitor the health of the US population. In this study, we evaluate whether the disability questions currently used in the NHIS - the Washington Group questions - threaten the ability of this survey to fulfil its stated objective for disabled people. Methods.Data were from the 2011-2012 NHIS with linkage to mortality status through 2019. We examined the percentage and characteristics of people reporting a disability in the American Community Survey (ACS) disability questions who were documented as such in the Washington Group (WG) disability questions. We then examined the consequence of use of the WG, as opposed to the ACS questions, on estimates of disability prevalence and comparative mortality risk. Results.We find that when compared to their predecessor, the American Community Survey disability questions, the Washington Group questions account for less than half of disabled people, primarily documenting disabled people with a more than one disability status, but excluding many disabled people with only one disability status. As a result of these exclusions, disability prevalence rates based on the Washington Group questions underestimate the size of the disabled population in the US, and overestimate the comparatively higher mortality risk associated with disability status. Conclusions.These results underscore the need to re-evaluate the disability questions used in the NHIS, and invest in the development of improved and expanded disability questionnaires for use in national surveys.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLockdowns have been used as a primary non-pharmaceutical intervention to stop transmission of COVID19. There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission.

MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties.

ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19.

ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTrade union presence within a workplace could potentially affect employees working conditions and in turn health. We assessed the relationship between union (presence and membership) at the individual level and mental health in the context of COVID-19 employment disruptions.

MethodsWe analysed panel data from Understanding Society collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (49,915 observations across 5,988 respondents) to assess the relationship between union presence and membership and a validated epidemiological measure of common mental disorders (CMD), the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire with a score of &gt;/4 indicating probable anxiety/depression, referred to as caseness. A mixed-effect log-linear model assessed effect heterogeneity across time and industries, with average marginal effects (AME) indicating effect differences between groups.

FindingsIn our sample, 49.1% worked in a unionised workplace, among which 53.8% were union members. Caseness prevalence was higher during the pandemic (25.4%) compared to pre-pandemic (18.4%). Working in a workplace with a trade union was associated with modest protection against CMD risk; (AMEpre-pandemic:0.010, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.027), (AME- pandemic:-0.002, 95%CI:-0.019; 0.016)]. Similarly, for union membership [(AMEpre- pandemic:0.016, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.039), (AMEpandemic:-0.010, 95%CI:-0.023; 0.020)]. Industry level heterogeneity exists in the relationship between union presence and membership and mental health.

InterpretationTrade union presence may have a protective effect on workers mental health in periods of crisis, such as during a pandemic. Within unionised workplaces, trade union membership further mitigated the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. Collective negotiation within workplaces may be protective in periods of uncertainty, benefiting all workers and not only those unionised.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundKara Tepe Registration and Identification Camp on Lesvos Island in Greece is a controlled access facility with people in various stages of the asylum procedure housed in tents, rub halls and containers in poor living conditions for prolonged periods of time. However, data are lacking on psychosocial vulnerabilities and experiences of these populations, particularly the growing number of single women residing in these settings.We aimed to explore psychosocial needs among this incamped population.

MethodsWe did a retrospective cross-sectional chart review of sociodemographic and psychosocial vulnerabilities of all migrants (&gt;18 years of age) who were detained in Kara Tepe between 1st February 2021 and 31st January 2023. Data were extracted from the Knack Online Database used by INTERSOS HELLAS.

Results701 individuals were referred to the clinic for psychosocial work-up over a 2 year follow-up period, of which 165 subsequently received psychological support after initial health assessments. The majority (92.0%) of the cohort were women who were single, most from Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo, and Syria, with a range of medical and social vulnerabilities. 19.8% of the population had been subjected to gender-based violence including in their country of origin, during the migration route to Lesvos, or while on the island of Lesvos. The most common GBV incident reported was rape (48.9%) followed by physical assault (23.7%) and non-penetrative sexual assault (21.5%). 7% of the population presented with suicidal, or self-harming, behaviour, of which 26.2% had attempted suicide.

ConclusionThis study highlights for the first time the stark range of vulnerabilities experienced by predominantly single women in camp settings in Greece.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, is most common in tropical regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite significant global effort to control and eradicate the disease, many cases and deaths are still reported yearly. These efforts are hindered by several factors, including the severe underestimation of cases and deaths, especially in Africa, making it difficult to assess the disease burden accurately. We used a mathematical model of malaria, incorporating the underestimation of cases and seasonality in mosquito biting rate, to study the disease dynamics in Cameroon. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrated our model to the monthly reported malaria cases in ten regions of Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021 to quantify the underestimation of cases and estimate other important epidemiological parameters. We performed Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components analysis to understand regional disparities, looking at underestimation rates, population sizes, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities per 1,000 people. We found varying levels of underestimation of cases across regions, with the East region having the lowest underestimation (14%) and the Northwest region with the highest (70%). The mosquito biting rate peaks once every year in most of the regions, except in the Northwest region where it peaks every 6.02 months and in Littoral every 15 months. We estimated a median mosquito biting rate of over five bites per day for most of the regions with Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). Two regions have rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day). The notably low estimation of malaria cases in Cameroon underscore the pressing requirement to bolster reporting and surveillance systems. Regions in Cameroon display a range of unique features, which may contribute to the differing levels of malaria underestimation. These distinctions should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of community-based interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPlay is essential for the cognitive, social, and emotional development of all children. Disparities potentially exist in access to play for children with disabilities, and the extent of this inequity is unknown.

MethodsData from 212,194 children aged 2-4 years in 38 Low and Middle-Income Countries were collected in the UNICEF supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017 - 2020). Disability was assessed by the Washington Group-Child Functioning Module. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between disability and play opportunities, controlling for age, sex, and wealth status. Meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates (overall, and disaggregated by sex), with heterogeneity assessed by Cochrans Q test.

FindingsChildren with disabilities have approximately 9% fewer play opportunities than those without disabilities (adjusted RR [aRR] =0.88, 95%CI=0.82-0.93), and this varied across countries. Mongolia and Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe had the lowest likelihood of play opportunities for children with disabilities ((aRR=0.26,95%CI=0.09-0.75; aRR=0.46, 95%CI=0.23-0.93, respectively). Moreover, children with disabilities are 17% less likely to be provided with opportunities to play with their mothers (aRR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.73-0.93), which is further reduced for girls with disabilities (aRR=0.74, 95% CI:0.60-0.90) compared to their peers without disabilities. The associations varied by impairment type, and children with communication and learning impairments are less likely to have opportunities for play with aRR of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.79) and 0.78 (95%CI:0.71-0.86), compared to those without disabilities, respectively.

InterpretationChildren with disabilities are being left behind in their access to play and this is likely to have negative impacts on their overall development and well-being.

FundingHK and TS receive funding from NIHR. The Study was funded by PENDA. SR receives funding from the Rhodes Trust.

Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies reporting population-representative estimates of children with disabilities exposure to play in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) published before Feb 7th, 2023. We used the following combination of keywords: &#34;play&#34; AND (&#34;early childhood&#34; OR &#34;preschool&#34; OR &#34;young children&#34;) AND (disability OR disabilities) AND &#34;prevalence&#34;. We found no multi-country studies reporting the prevalence or country-level disparities (within or between countries) for opportunities for play for children with disabilities. We did not identify any studies synthesising or comparing estimates across all dimensions of play or disability, nor did we identify studies reporting population-representative estimates of play for all LMICs. UNICEF has published global reports, which reveal that children with disabilities receive less early stimulation and responsive care and have limited exposure to childrens books and toys compared to children without disabilities, however opportunities for play within the household setting have not been examined in a comprehensive analysis.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the opportunities for play for children with disabilities compared to those without across multiple countries. Moreover, it provides a large dataset on this topic including 212,194 children aged 2-4 years from 38 low and middle income countries (LMICs), including approximately 6.1% with disabilities (i.e. reporting a lot of difficulty or more in a functional domain). The study has advanced the literature in five substantive ways. First, we highlighted that children with disabilities have fewer opportunities to play, across multiple measures of play and multiple settings. Second, we demonstrated that there are disparities in play opportunities for children with disabilities across countries. Third, we showed that this varied by impairment and was worst for children with learning and communication impairments. Fourth, we showed that there was a discrepancy between girls and boys with disabilities. Finally, our work extends beyond simple description by deploying ratio ratios to provide a quantitative risk assessment. This enables us to identify areas of particular concern and suggest where interventions may be most needed. The ratio ratios shed light on the severity of disparities and pinpoint specific high-risk categories such as particular countries, types of disabilities, or population groups. This analysis is crucial for refining interventions and optimising resource allocation, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study findings emphasise the importance of including children with disabilities in early child development programmes, and where relevant preschool, which may require modifications to ensure inclusivity. Programmes are needed that specifically target children with learning or communication impairments. This may work best through parent support programmes, as formal preschool or programmes may be lacking in LMICs. Monitoring participation is crucial for children with disabilities. To promote equal opportunities for play at home, in schools, and in other community settings, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and attitudes of parents, teachers, and caregivers, as well as implement policies that address barriers to participation. The findings underscore the urgent need for policies to reflect the inclusion of children with disabilities. Research is needed to establish evidence regarding the importance of promoting play opportunities beyond the home environment, including pre-schools, schools, and community settings. Furthermore, well-designed studies to provide affordable, timely and accessible data on effective strategies for enhancing play for children with disabilities are required. This information will enable programme developers and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on improving the lives of children with disabilities worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We use three quantitative case studies to argue that ubiquitous and universal condemnation of fossil fuel subsidies is myopic and does not adequately consider subsidizing gas for cooking as a potential strategy to improve public health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ecuador offers a view into the long-run impacts of gas subsidies, having made historical investments in subsidizing gas for cooking that led to widespread use that outpaces peer nations. We calculate that the subsidy likely averted 100,000 premature deaths with benefits that outweigh costs four to one. India successfully implemented the largest gas cooking access program in the world, but the level of subsidies provided by the government has varied. We estimate that mortality and climate benefits from maintaining varying levels of the gas subsidy between 2023-2030 will be roughly double costs. In Kenya, removing a value added tax on LPG will yield health and climate benefits that will dwarf the lost revenue by [~]30x. Waiting for existing policies and momentum to move households toward near-exclusive clean fuel use forces marginalized populations to directly face the health, environmental, and socio-economic harms of traditional cooking. Rather than wait decades for development to provide clean cooking to these households, which will deepen health and energy inequities, we suggest that targeted LPG subsidies offer a solution available today and provide immediate health and climate benefits.

One-Sentence SummaryCondemnation of cooking gas subsidies lacks broader perspective, as such subsidies enable cleaner cooking and can deliver health and climate benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Objective.The objective of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is to provide data that can be used to monitor the health of the US population. In this study, we evaluate whether the disability questions currently used in the NHIS - the Washington Group questions - threaten the ability of this survey to fulfil its stated objective for disabled people.

Methods.Data were from the 2011-2012 NHIS with linkage to mortality status through 2019. We examined the percentage and characteristics of people reporting a disability in the American Community Survey (ACS) disability questions who were documented as such in the Washington Group (WG) disability questions. We then examined the consequence of use of the WG, as opposed to the ACS questions, on estimates of disability prevalence and comparative mortality risk.

Results.We find that when compared to their predecessor, the American Community Survey disability questions, the Washington Group questions account for less than half of disabled people, primarily documenting disabled people with a more than one disability status, but excluding many disabled people with only one disability status. As a result of these exclusions, disability prevalence rates based on the Washington Group questions underestimate the size of the disabled population in the US, and overestimate the comparatively higher mortality risk associated with disability status.

Conclusions.These results underscore the need to re-evaluate the disability questions used in the NHIS, and invest in the development of improved and expanded disability questionnaires for use in national surveys.</p>
