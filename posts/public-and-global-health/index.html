A lack of tools to measure local exclusion hampers targeted interventions. In this study a composite indicator for digital exclusion and associated toolkit was developed. Indicator variables were normalised and aggregated. Factor analysis determined indicator weightings. Local levels of claiming Guaranteed Pension Credit, unemployment and low socioeconomic status showed strong mutual correlation. Underlying constructs were identified related to socioeconomic deprivation, poor academic qualifications, lack of activity and barriers to digital access. In general, coastal areas in Lincolnshire, UK had higher levels of digital exclusion, with significant local disparities within urban areas.

In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nExploring Disparities and Novel Insights into Metabo-Nutritional Comorbidities among COVID-19 Patients in Mexico\nAuthors: Lopez-Cuevas, A.; Martinez-Garcia, M.; Hernandez-Lemus, E.; de Anda-Jauregui, G.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293471\nDuring the previous years, particularly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential role of metabo-nutritional comorbidities in the severity and lethality of SARS-CoV2 infection has been widely discussed, often describing ambiguous outcomes. Here we investigate the prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients in Mexico. Using a retrospective observational study design, data was collected from official databases of COVID-19 patients admitted to public and private hospitals in Mexico City. Our study found a discordant prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients, particularly obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Discordance consists in geographic location-dependent over and under-representation phenomena, that is the prevalence of such comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was significantly over or under the reported value for the general population in each location. These findings highlight the importance of screening for metabo-nutritional comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and suggest the need for tailored interventions for this population. The study also provides insights into the complex relationships between COVID-19 and metabo-nutritional comorbidities, which may inform future research and clinical practice.\nLLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) - Plasmodium infection prevalence and genotypic markers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors from 48 districts of Uganda\nAuthors: Lynd, A. R.; Gonahasa, S.; Staedke, S. G.; Oruni, A.; Maiteki-Sebuguzi, C.; Hancock, P. A.; Knight, E.; Dorsey, G.; Opigo, J.; Yeka, A.; Katureebe, A.; Kyohere, M.; Hemingway, J.; Kamya, M. R.; McDermott, D.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293323\nBackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections. ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda. ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

E.; Tuite, A.; Fisman, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293449\nBackgroundSurveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk. MethodsSARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary. ResultsTesting rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%. ConclusionsStandardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.\nThe effect of conflict on medical facilities in Mariupol, Ukraine: a quasi-experimental study\nAuthors: Poole, D. N.; Andersen, D.; Raymond, N. A.; Parham, J.; Howarth, C.; Hathaway, O. A.; Khoshnood, K.; Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, Score: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293508\nMedical facilities are civilian objects specially protected by international humanitarian law. Despite the need for systematic documentation of the effects of war on medical facilities for judiciary accountability, current methods for surveilling damage to protected civilian objects during ongoing armed conflict are insufficient. Satellite imagery damage assessment confers significant possibilities for investigating patterns of war. We leveraged commercially and publicly available satellite imagery and geolocated facility data to conduct a pre-post quasi-experimental study of damage to medical infrastructure in Mariupol, Ukraine as a result of Russias invasion. We found that 77% of medical facilities in Mariupol sustained damage during Russias siege lasting from February 24 - May 20, 2022. Facility size was not associated with damage, suggesting that attacks on medical facilities are not a residual of physical infrastructure characteristics. This is the first geographically comprehensive pre-post study of the effects of an ongoing conflict on specially protected medical infrastructure.\nInfant and Neonatal Mortality During the Covid-19 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis From Five Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nAuthors: Wagner, Z.; Heft-Neal, S.; Wang, Z.; Jing, R.; Bendavid, E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293619\nBackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic led to widespread changes to health and social institutions. The effects of the pandemic on neonatal and infant health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are poorly understood, and nationally representative data characterizing changes to health care and outcomes is only now emerging. MethodsWe used nationally representative survey data with vital status and perinatal care information on 2,959,203 children born in India, Madagascar, Cambodia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Using interrupted time series models, we estimated the change in neonatal mortality (death in first 30 days of life) and infant mortality (death in first year of life) following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, controlling for granular location fixed-effects and seasonality. FindingsWe analyzed 2,935,052 births (146,820 deaths) before March 2020 and 24,151 births (799 deaths) after March 2020. We estimated that infant mortality increased by 9.9 deaths per 1,000 live births after March 2020 (95% CI 5.0, 15.0; p\u003c0.01; 22% increase) and neonatal mortality increased by 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 2.4, 11.1; p\u003c0.01; 27% increase). We observe increased mortality in all study countries. We also estimated a 3.8 percentage point reduction in antenatal care use (95% CI -4.9, -2.7; p\u003c0.01) and a 5.6 percentage point reduction in facility deliveries (95% CI -7.2, -4.0; p\u003c0.01) during the pandemic. InterpretationSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, neonatal and infant mortality are higher than expected in five LMICs. Helping LMICs resume pre-pandemic declines in neonatal and infant mortality should be a major global priority. FundingNational Institute of Child Health and Development (R01HD104835 PI Wagner) Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on infant and neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is not well-understood. We searched PubMed using the terms \"COVID\" AND ((\"child\" OR \"infant\" OR \"neonatal\") AND \"mortality\")) AND (\"low- and middle-income countries\" OR \"developing countries\") on May 10, 2023, without language restrictions. The existing evidence is mixed. Increased mortality rates have been documented in Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, and Nepal while decreased rates documented in South Africa and Guinea. Prior analyses were mainly based on clinic and hospital administrative data and were often confined to a selection of facilities or geographic areas, hampering the generalizability of the existing evidence. We found no published article that leveraged nationally representative data sources to provide a general assessment of infant or neonatal mortality in LMICs following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive and generalizable investigation of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on infant and neonatal mortality in LMICs to date. Using nationally representative survey data from five LMICs that were recently released, we estimated an increase of 9.9 and 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in infant and neonatal mortality, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic. We also found significant reductions in antenatal care use and facility deliveries, which could partly explain the changes in mortality we document. Implications of the available evidenceOur study highlights significant increases in infant and neonatal mortality rates in five LMICs following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which sets back about a decades worth of progress. The decline in antenatal care services and facility births documented in our study suggests mortality increases were partly driven by disruptions in health service access induced by Covid-19 control measures. Helping to get reductions in neonatal and infant mortality back on track in LMICs should be a major global priority.\nComparative Immunogenicity, Safety and Efficacy Profiles of four COVID-19 Vaccine types in healthy adults: Systematic Review cum Meta-analysis of Clinical Trial data\nAuthors: Yoong, S. Q.; Bhowmik, P.; Dutta, D.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293964\nFour principal types of authorised COVID-19 vaccines include inactivated whole-virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, viral-vector vaccines and nucleic acid (mRNA and DNA) vaccines. Despite numerous Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), comprehensive systematic review and comparative meta-analysis have not been performed to validate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the healthy adult population. We aim to fulfil this unmet void. We searched for peer-reviewed articles about RCTs of the COVID-19 vaccines on healthy adults (18-64 years) available in eight major bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, POPLINE, HINARI) till August 28, 2022. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted by pooling dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (safety outcomes) and continuous outcomes using standardised mean differences (immunogenicity outcomes). Efficacy outcomes were summarised narratively. Moderate to high-quality evidence suggests that those receiving COVID-19 vaccines had significantly higher immune responses compared to placebo. Serious adverse events were rare, confirming that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and immunogenic for the healthy adult population. Remarkably, adverse events were the least common in inactivated vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines were the most immunogenic. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 21.9% to 95.9% in preventing COVID-19. We endorse all four types of COVID-19 vaccines for public health policy implementing taskforces. Yet, meta-analyses based on individual patient data are warranted for more extensive measurement of differential impacts of COVID-19 vaccines on different genders, ethnicities, comorbidities and types of vaccine jabbed.\nBi-directional associations between mask usage and the associated reasons before and after the downgrading of the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan: A longitudinal study\nAuthors: Murakami, M.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.23293298\nObjectivesFrom a public health perspective, it is important to clarify the associations between mask usage and the associated reasons in situations when mask usage is promoted or mitigated. Therefore, I clarified the changes in mask usage and the associated reasons before and after the downgrading of the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan, and analyzed the bi-directional associations between the two. DesignLongitudinal study. MethodsOnline surveys were conducted in two waves, between April 18-19, 2023 and June 6-15, 2023, among people aged 20-69 years living in Japan. A total of 291 participants completed both the surveys. The associations between mask usage and beliefs about the reasons for mask usage were analyzed using a cross-lagged panel model. ResultsMask usage decreased slightly, but significantly, from the first to the second wave (P \u003c 0.001, Cohens d = -0.23). Of the eight beliefs regarding mask usage, slight but significant decreases were observed in terms of relief and information effects (P = 0.046, Cohens d = -0.12; P = 0.018, Cohens d = -0.14). There was a significant association between socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance (such as norm and relief) during the first wave and mask usage during the second wave [standard estimates:0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.06-0.44)]. Contrarily, mask usage during the first wave was significantly associated with the reasons for infection risk avoidance during the second wave [standard estimates:0.13 (0.03-0.24)]. ConclusionsThe impact of downgrading the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan on mask usage and the associated reasons were found to be limited. In terms of promoting or mitigating mask usage, the significance of risk communication based on socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance, such as norms and relief, was highlighted.\nClinical manifestations and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tanzania, 2021-2022.\nAuthors: Osati, E.

It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania. Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [\u0026ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age \u003e90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P\u003c0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P\u003c0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P\u003c0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study. ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Digital exclusion leads to marginalization and inequality. A lack of tools to measure local exclusion hampers targeted interventions. In this study a composite indicator for digital exclusion and associated toolkit was developed. Indicator variables were normalised and aggregated. Factor analysis determined indicator weightings. Local levels of claiming Guaranteed Pension Credit, unemployment and low socioeconomic status showed strong mutual correlation. Underlying constructs were identified related to socioeconomic deprivation, poor academic qualifications, lack of activity and barriers to digital access. In general, coastal areas in Lincolnshire, UK had higher levels of digital exclusion, with significant local disparities within urban areas. The Lincolnshire Digital Health toolkit assists decision-makers in understanding and addressing digital exclusion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.

ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.

ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the previous years, particularly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential role of metabo-nutritional comorbidities in the severity and lethality of SARS-CoV2 infection has been widely discussed, often describing ambiguous outcomes. Here we investigate the prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients in Mexico. Using a retrospective observational study design, data was collected from official databases of COVID-19 patients admitted to public and private hospitals in Mexico City. Our study found a discordant prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients, particularly obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Discordance consists in geographic location-dependent over and under-representation phenomena, that is the prevalence of such comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was significantly over or under the reported value for the general population in each location. These findings highlight the importance of screening for metabo-nutritional comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and suggest the need for tailored interventions for this population. The study also provides insights into the complex relationships between COVID-19 and metabo-nutritional comorbidities, which may inform future research and clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections.

ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda.

ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSurveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary.

ResultsTesting rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%.

ConclusionsStandardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medical facilities are civilian objects specially protected by international humanitarian law. Despite the need for systematic documentation of the effects of war on medical facilities for judiciary accountability, current methods for surveilling damage to protected civilian objects during ongoing armed conflict are insufficient. Satellite imagery damage assessment confers significant possibilities for investigating patterns of war. We leveraged commercially and publicly available satellite imagery and geolocated facility data to conduct a pre-post quasi-experimental study of damage to medical infrastructure in Mariupol, Ukraine as a result of Russias invasion. We found that 77% of medical facilities in Mariupol sustained damage during Russias siege lasting from February 24 - May 20, 2022. Facility size was not associated with damage, suggesting that attacks on medical facilities are not a residual of physical infrastructure characteristics. This is the first geographically comprehensive pre-post study of the effects of an ongoing conflict on specially protected medical infrastructure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic led to widespread changes to health and social institutions. The effects of the pandemic on neonatal and infant health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are poorly understood, and nationally representative data characterizing changes to health care and outcomes is only now emerging.

MethodsWe used nationally representative survey data with vital status and perinatal care information on 2,959,203 children born in India, Madagascar, Cambodia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Using interrupted time series models, we estimated the change in neonatal mortality (death in first 30 days of life) and infant mortality (death in first year of life) following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, controlling for granular location fixed-effects and seasonality.

FindingsWe analyzed 2,935,052 births (146,820 deaths) before March 2020 and 24,151 births (799 deaths) after March 2020. We estimated that infant mortality increased by 9.9 deaths per 1,000 live births after March 2020 (95% CI 5.0, 15.0; p&lt;0.01; 22% increase) and neonatal mortality increased by 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 2.4, 11.1; p&lt;0.01; 27% increase). We observe increased mortality in all study countries. We also estimated a 3.8 percentage point reduction in antenatal care use (95% CI -4.9, -2.7; p&lt;0.01) and a 5.6 percentage point reduction in facility deliveries (95% CI -7.2, -4.0; p&lt;0.01) during the pandemic.

InterpretationSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, neonatal and infant mortality are higher than expected in five LMICs. Helping LMICs resume pre-pandemic declines in neonatal and infant mortality should be a major global priority.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on infant and neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is not well-understood. We searched PubMed using the terms &#34;COVID&#34; AND ((&#34;child&#34; OR &#34;infant&#34; OR &#34;neonatal&#34;) AND &#34;mortality&#34;)) AND (&#34;low- and middle-income countries&#34; OR &#34;developing countries&#34;) on May 10, 2023, without language restrictions. The existing evidence is mixed. Increased mortality rates have been documented in Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, and Nepal while decreased rates documented in South Africa and Guinea. Prior analyses were mainly based on clinic and hospital administrative data and were often confined to a selection of facilities or geographic areas, hampering the generalizability of the existing evidence. We found no published article that leveraged nationally representative data sources to provide a general assessment of infant or neonatal mortality in LMICs following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive and generalizable investigation of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on infant and neonatal mortality in LMICs to date. Using nationally representative survey data from five LMICs that were recently released, we estimated an increase of 9.9 and 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in infant and neonatal mortality, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic. We also found significant reductions in antenatal care use and facility deliveries, which could partly explain the changes in mortality we document.

Implications of the available evidenceOur study highlights significant increases in infant and neonatal mortality rates in five LMICs following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which sets back about a decades worth of progress. The decline in antenatal care services and facility births documented in our study suggests mortality increases were partly driven by disruptions in health service access induced by Covid-19 control measures. Helping to get reductions in neonatal and infant mortality back on track in LMICs should be a major global priority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Four principal types of authorised COVID-19 vaccines include inactivated whole-virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, viral-vector vaccines and nucleic acid (mRNA and DNA) vaccines. Despite numerous Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), comprehensive systematic review and comparative meta-analysis have not been performed to validate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the healthy adult population. We aim to fulfil this unmet void. We searched for peer-reviewed articles about RCTs of the COVID-19 vaccines on healthy adults (18-64 years) available in eight major bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, POPLINE, HINARI) till August 28, 2022. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted by pooling dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (safety outcomes) and continuous outcomes using standardised mean differences (immunogenicity outcomes). Efficacy outcomes were summarised narratively. Moderate to high-quality evidence suggests that those receiving COVID-19 vaccines had significantly higher immune responses compared to placebo. Serious adverse events were rare, confirming that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and immunogenic for the healthy adult population. Remarkably, adverse events were the least common in inactivated vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines were the most immunogenic. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 21.9% to 95.9% in preventing COVID-19. We endorse all four types of COVID-19 vaccines for public health policy implementing taskforces. Yet, meta-analyses based on individual patient data are warranted for more extensive measurement of differential impacts of COVID-19 vaccines on different genders, ethnicities, comorbidities and types of vaccine jabbed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesFrom a public health perspective, it is important to clarify the associations between mask usage and the associated reasons in situations when mask usage is promoted or mitigated. Therefore, I clarified the changes in mask usage and the associated reasons before and after the downgrading of the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan, and analyzed the bi-directional associations between the two.

DesignLongitudinal study.

MethodsOnline surveys were conducted in two waves, between April 18-19, 2023 and June 6-15, 2023, among people aged 20-69 years living in Japan. A total of 291 participants completed both the surveys. The associations between mask usage and beliefs about the reasons for mask usage were analyzed using a cross-lagged panel model.

ResultsMask usage decreased slightly, but significantly, from the first to the second wave (P &lt; 0.001, Cohens d = -0.23). Of the eight beliefs regarding mask usage, slight but significant decreases were observed in terms of relief and information effects (P = 0.046, Cohens d = -0.12; P = 0.018, Cohens d = -0.14). There was a significant association between socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance (such as norm and relief) during the first wave and mask usage during the second wave [standard estimates:0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.06-0.44)]. Contrarily, mask usage during the first wave was significantly associated with the reasons for infection risk avoidance during the second wave [standard estimates:0.13 (0.03-0.24)].

ConclusionsThe impact of downgrading the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan on mask usage and the associated reasons were found to be limited. In terms of promoting or mitigating mask usage, the significance of risk communication based on socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance, such as norms and relief, was highlighted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere have been differential mortality rates from Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in different parts of the world. It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania.

Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [&amp;ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age &gt;90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P&lt;0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P&lt;0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P&lt;0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study.

ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.</p>
