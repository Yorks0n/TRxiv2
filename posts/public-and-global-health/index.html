However, uncertainty persists regarding the effectiveness of these interventions due to data quality issues, methodological challenges, and differing contextual factors. Accurate estimation of their effects is crucial for future epidemic preparedness. MethodsTo address this, we developed a population-based mechanistic model that includes the impact of NPIs and vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospitalization rates. Our statistical approach estimated all parameters in one step, accurately propagating uncertainty. We fitted the model to comprehensive epidemiological data in France from March 2020 to October 2021. With the same model, we simulated scenarios of vaccine rollout. ResultsThe first lockdown was the most effective, reducing transmission by 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83-85). Subsequent lockdowns had diminished effectiveness (reduction of 74% (69-77) and 11% (9-18), respectively). A 6pm curfew was more effective than one at 8 pm (68% (66-69) vs. 48% (45-49) reduction), while school closures reduced transmission by 15% (12-18). In a scenario without vaccines before November 2021, we predicted 159,000 or 194% (95% prediction interval (PI) 74-424) more deaths and 1,488,000 or 340% (136-689) more hospitalizations. If a vaccine had been available after 100 days, over 71,000 deaths (16,507-204,249) and 384,000 (88,579-1,020,386) hospitalizations could have been averted. ConclusionOur results highlight the substantial impact of NPIs, including lockdowns and curfews, in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. We also demonstrate the value of the 100 days objective of the CEPI initiative for vaccine availability.\n#ActuallyAutistic Twitter dataset for precision diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nAuthors: Jaiswal, A.; Washington, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295799\nThe increasing usage of social media platforms has given rise to an unprecedented surge in user- generated content with millions of users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and health-related information. Because of this social media has turned out to be a useful means to study and understand public health. Twitter is one such platform that has proven to be a valuable source of such information for both public and health officials. We present a novel dataset consisting of 6,515,470 tweets collected from users self identifying with autism using \"#ActuallyAutistic\" and a control group. The dataset also has supporting information such as posting dates, follower count, geographical location, and interaction metrics. We illustrate the utility of the dataset through common Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, tweet and user classification, and topic modeling. The textual differences in social media communications can help researchers and clinicians to conduct symptomatology studies, in natural settings, by establishing effective biomarkers to distinguish an autistic individual from their typical peers. For better accessibility, reusability and new research insights, we have released the dataset publicly.\nCaring for Terminally Ill Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review of Literature on the Stress Experienced by Family Caregivers\nAuthors: Jhang, K.; Luh, D.-L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295878\nObjective: This research takes previous study, Cancer family caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases: A review of the descriptive psychosocial literature, limited in recent decade, as methodology template. The purpose of this review was to organize the literature as compared to the different result of previous study. Method: As a systematic review, major databases were searched for non-intervention descriptive studies. Psychosocial variables of family caregivers to adults with cancer during the different phases would be included. Result: The 23 studies reviewed were conducted in ten countries and varied considerably by samples, outcome measures, and results. Despite limiting several conditions, results, such as age, gender, and relationship to the patient, were inconsistent. Across the 23 studies, 53 unique instruments were used; 13 of which were no psychometric testing. The family caregivers who were younger and faced level of daily life impairment tended to be burden, anxious, depress. To summarize the different factors influencing caregivers' status, complicated grief was consistent with their situation. Conclusion: As compare with previous study, it demonstrated inconsistent results, which were spouse, gender and age, affecting family caregivers' status. However, regarding to measurement instruments using, it was much more rigorous than before. Also, it had been changed in the major study site and the number of study. As a consequence of physical and psychosocial status of family caregivers, they were in high risk population.\nPastoral (im)mobility and zoonotic disease: a qualitative participatory study in Plateau State, Nigeria\nAuthors: Braam, D. H.; Bolajoko, M.-B.; Hammer, C. C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294938\nBackgroundIn Plateau State, pastoralism has historically been a cost effective and resilient economic system well-suited to the ecological context. However, changes in land use and conflict have increasingly changed patterns of mobility. Pastoralist movement is now often associated with zoonotic disease transmission, environmental degradation and conflict, increasingly resulting in forced sedentarisation. Rather than a direct outcome of population movement however, zoonotic disease drivers are complex and influenced by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. The interlinkages of (im)mobility and zoonotic health requires better understanding of underlying vulnerabilities to disease, which we aim to address in this study. MethodsUsing a multisite case study methodology we investigated pastoralists zoonotic health concerns and priorities in Plateau State, Nigeria. We deployed participatory tools, including open-ended Focus Group Discussions, transect walks, mapping exercises, calendars and matrices. Data were analysed using a One Health conceptual framework. ResultsWe interviewed 105 participants, from transhumance, migratory and sedentary households, dependent on livestock and small-scale crops. While transhumance was often preferred, participants had become sedentary as a result of insecurity, loss in livestock, and household characteristics. Humans and animals suffered from several endemic diseases, including zoonoses, however veterinary and human health services are only available in larger towns, and people mostly rely on community (animal) health workers and self-medication. Both transhumance and sedentary livestock keepers face challenges around forage grazing, regularly blocked by landowners, sometimes escalating into conflict. ConclusionsWhile conflict and changes in land use affected animal and human disease patterns, underlying political, social and economic risk factors were important determinants of health. There is a need for more inclusive, transdisciplinary, multilevel approaches to address neglected zoonoses, based on better contextualization of the challenges, through the participation of affected communities. ImpactsO_LIThis study uses participatory approaches to investigate the under researched area of mobility and zoonotic disease dynamics. C_LIO_LIWe found that animal and human mobility may mitigate or exacerbate zoonotic disease risk, impacting conflict, in turn leading to forced migration. C_LIO_LISecurity challenges need to be addressed simultaneously with mitigating structural inequality, through increasing pastoral social and economic capital, increase access to grazing routes and water, secure land tenure arrangements, and the provision of (veterinary) public health to reduce zoonotic disease risks for the wider population.

        <p class="abstract">Objective: This research takes previous study, Cancer family caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases: A review of the descriptive psychosocial literature, limited in recent decade, as methodology template. The purpose of this review was to organize the literature as compared to the different result of previous study. Method: As a systematic review, major databases were searched for non-intervention descriptive studies. Psychosocial variables of family caregivers to adults with cancer during the different phases would be included. Result: The 23 studies reviewed were conducted in ten countries and varied considerably by samples, outcome measures, and results. Despite limiting several conditions, results, such as age, gender, and relationship to the patient, were inconsistent. Across the 23 studies, 53 unique instruments were used; 13 of which were no psychometric testing. The family caregivers who were younger and faced level of daily life impairment tended to be burden, anxious, depress. To summarize the different factors influencing caregivers&#39; status, complicated grief was consistent with their situation. Conclusion: As compare with previous study, it demonstrated inconsistent results, which were spouse, gender and age, affecting family caregivers&#39; status. However, regarding to measurement instruments using, it was much more rigorous than before. Also, it had been changed in the major study site and the number of study. As a consequence of physical and psychosocial status of family caregivers, they were in high risk population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn Plateau State, pastoralism has historically been a cost effective and resilient economic system well-suited to the ecological context. However, changes in land use and conflict have increasingly changed patterns of mobility. Pastoralist movement is now often associated with zoonotic disease transmission, environmental degradation and conflict, increasingly resulting in forced sedentarisation. Rather than a direct outcome of population movement however, zoonotic disease drivers are complex and influenced by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. The interlinkages of (im)mobility and zoonotic health requires better understanding of underlying vulnerabilities to disease, which we aim to address in this study.

MethodsUsing a multisite case study methodology we investigated pastoralists zoonotic health concerns and priorities in Plateau State, Nigeria. We deployed participatory tools, including open-ended Focus Group Discussions, transect walks, mapping exercises, calendars and matrices. Data were analysed using a One Health conceptual framework.

ResultsWe interviewed 105 participants, from transhumance, migratory and sedentary households, dependent on livestock and small-scale crops. While transhumance was often preferred, participants had become sedentary as a result of insecurity, loss in livestock, and household characteristics. Humans and animals suffered from several endemic diseases, including zoonoses, however veterinary and human health services are only available in larger towns, and people mostly rely on community (animal) health workers and self-medication. Both transhumance and sedentary livestock keepers face challenges around forage grazing, regularly blocked by landowners, sometimes escalating into conflict.

ConclusionsWhile conflict and changes in land use affected animal and human disease patterns, underlying political, social and economic risk factors were important determinants of health. There is a need for more inclusive, transdisciplinary, multilevel approaches to address neglected zoonoses, based on better contextualization of the challenges, through the participation of affected communities.

ImpactsO_LIThis study uses participatory approaches to investigate the under researched area of mobility and zoonotic disease dynamics.
C_LIO_LIWe found that animal and human mobility may mitigate or exacerbate zoonotic disease risk, impacting conflict, in turn leading to forced migration.
C_LIO_LISecurity challenges need to be addressed simultaneously with mitigating structural inequality, through increasing pastoral social and economic capital, increase access to grazing routes and water, secure land tenure arrangements, and the provision of (veterinary) public health to reduce zoonotic disease risks for the wider population.
