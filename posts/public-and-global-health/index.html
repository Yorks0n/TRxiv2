J.\nScore: 141.0, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nExcess deaths in China during SARS-CoV-2 viral waves in 2022-2023\nAuthors: Jha, P.; Brown, P. E.; Lam, T.; Morawski, E.; Reid, A.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.23297204\nBackground The extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented. Methods We worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined age-specific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019. Findings The survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60+ years and 212 were women. At ages 60+ years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60+ years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1.35 million excess deaths over the two months. Interpretation China experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.\nMolecular Epidemiology of Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Kalule, J. B.; Bester, L. A.; Banda, D. L.; Derra, F. A.; Chikuse, F.; Tessema, S. K.; Africa PGI Foodborne Diseases Genomic Surveillance Focus Group, ; Foster-Nyarko, E.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296874\nIntroductionDiarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent. MethodsThe review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. ResultsThe reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce. ConclusionDespite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on non-communicable disease patients in sub-Saharan African countries: systematic review\nAuthors: Basa, M. B.; De Vries, J.; McDonagh, D.; Comiskey, C.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296938\nBackgroundCOVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries. MethodThis systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations. FindingsThis review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems. ConclusionThis systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use. The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting. All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.\nPerceptions and responses to COVID-19 through wastewater surveillance information and online search behavior: A randomized controlled trial\nAuthors: Murakami, M.; Nomura, S.; Ando, H.; Kitajima, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297297\nWastewater surveillance is anticipated to be a representative and timely method to assess infectious disease status; however, its influence on public perception and behavior remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [\u0026ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants' online search history for key words such as \"bullet train,\" \"highway,\" \"airplane,\" and \"wastewater.\" The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.\nHealth journal coverage of climate change and health: a bibliometric study\nAuthors: Muhia, J.; Rethlefsen, M.; Rossington, B.; Wedmore, F.; Pattnaik, A.; Smith, R.; Schroter, S.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297267\nObjectivesTo find what proportion of a broad set of health journals have published on climate change and health, how many articles they have published, and when they first published on the subject. DesignBibliometric study. Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility. ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time. ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility C_LIO_LIJournals not currently indexed in MEDLINE had to be excluded as hand searching was not feasible for such a large sample of journals C_LIO_LIIts important to be cautious in generalising to all health journals from our sample C_LIO_LIOur study included analysis of an intervention (publication of the joint editorials in multiple journals) to increase coverage on climate change and health in health journals.

R.; Pickering, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296174\nOne-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species. Detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations. SynopsisLimited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.\nPublic but ineffective: Fatality inquiries into childhood deaths in Alberta.\nAuthors: Verbeke, M.-C.; Mitchell, I.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296196\nIntroductionChild Death Review (CDR) processes are public efforts to review a childs death to understand how and why children die, to improve child health and to prevent future deaths. In 2013, the Canadian Paediatric Society made specific recommendations to establish structured and comprehensive CDR systems in each province and territory. In Alberta, there is no comprehensive CDR process but there are some components. The most public and probably the most expensive component is the public fatality inquiry. A new notification policy adopted after in June 2017 appears to be of limited value for child death prevention. MethodsWe examined all Alberta fatality inquiry reports from January 1, 1995 to April 15, 2023 concerning children aged 0-17 years (n=133) to determine whether the fatality inquiry system might be effective in preventing future similar deaths. ResultsRecommendations made by judges in a fatality inquiry were not always followed by action, and hence inquiry recommendations have been largely ineffective. Fatality inquiry recommendations were sometimes untimely, and therefore had little chance of being effective. There is an increasing trend from 1995 (case 1) to 2023 (case 133) in the time taken to initiate a child fatality inquiry review. Discussion and ConclusionInformation and recommendations from fatality inquiries into Alberta childhood deaths tend to be delayed and not followed by action. A comprehensive CDR process is required in Alberta. With system changes, public fatality inquiries could be an effective part of the child death prevention process.\nIntimate partner violence and its correlates in middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-country secondary analysis\nAuthors: Chang, G.; Tucker, J.; Walker, K.; Chu, C.; Miall, N.; Tan, R.; Wu, D.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296197\nBackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey. MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data. ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p\u003c0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04). ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented. Methods We worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined age-specific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019. Findings The survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60&#43; years and 212 were women. At ages 60&#43; years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60&#43; years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1.35 million excess deaths over the two months. Interpretation China experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionDiarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent.

MethodsThe review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsThe reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce.

ConclusionDespite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries.

MethodThis systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations.

FindingsThis review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems.

ConclusionThis systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use.

The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting. All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance is anticipated to be a representative and timely method to assess infectious disease status; however, its influence on public perception and behavior remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [&amp;ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants&#39; online search history for key words such as &#34;bullet train,&#34; &#34;highway,&#34; &#34;airplane,&#34; and &#34;wastewater.&#34; The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo find what proportion of a broad set of health journals have published on climate change and health, how many articles they have published, and when they first published on the subject.

DesignBibliometric study.

Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility.

ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time.

ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods
C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility
C_LIO_LIJournals not currently indexed in MEDLINE had to be excluded as hand searching was not feasible for such a large sample of journals
C_LIO_LIIts important to be cautious in generalising to all health journals from our sample
C_LIO_LIOur study included analysis of an intervention (publication of the joint editorials in multiple journals) to increase coverage on climate change and health in health journals.

        <p class="abstract">One-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species. Detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations.

SynopsisLimited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionChild Death Review (CDR) processes are public efforts to review a childs death to understand how and why children die, to improve child health and to prevent future deaths. In 2013, the Canadian Paediatric Society made specific recommendations to establish structured and comprehensive CDR systems in each province and territory. In Alberta, there is no comprehensive CDR process but there are some components. The most public and probably the most expensive component is the public fatality inquiry. A new notification policy adopted after in June 2017 appears to be of limited value for child death prevention.

MethodsWe examined all Alberta fatality inquiry reports from January 1, 1995 to April 15, 2023 concerning children aged 0-17 years (n=133) to determine whether the fatality inquiry system might be effective in preventing future similar deaths.

ResultsRecommendations made by judges in a fatality inquiry were not always followed by action, and hence inquiry recommendations have been largely ineffective. Fatality inquiry recommendations were sometimes untimely, and therefore had little chance of being effective. There is an increasing trend from 1995 (case 1) to 2023 (case 133) in the time taken to initiate a child fatality inquiry review.

Discussion and ConclusionInformation and recommendations from fatality inquiries into Alberta childhood deaths tend to be delayed and not followed by action. A comprehensive CDR process is required in Alberta. With system changes, public fatality inquiries could be an effective part of the child death prevention process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey.

MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data.

ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p&lt;0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04).

ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.</p>
