Despite undeniable advantages compared to patient-centered approaches (cost, anonymity, survey of large populations without bias, detection of asymptomatic infected peoples etc), major technical limitations persist. Among them is the low sensitivity of the current methods used for quantifying and sequencing viral genomes from wastewater. In situations of low viral circulation, during initial stages of viral emergences, or in countries experiencing heavy rains, the extremely low concentrations of viruses in wastewater may fall below the limit of detection of the current methods. The availability and cost of the commercial kits, as well as the requirement of expensive materials, can also present major blocks to the development of wastewater-based epidemiological survey, specifically in low-income countries. Thereby, highly sensitive, low cost and open-access methods are still needed to increase the predictability of the viral emergences, to survey low-circulating viruses and to allow wastewater-based surveillance. Here, we outline and characterize new protocols for concentrating, quantifying, monitoring, and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes (500 mL-1L) of raw wastewater. Our nucleic acid extraction technique (the routine C: 5ml method) does not require sophisticated equipment such as automatons and is not reliant on commercial kits, making it readily available to a broader range of laboratories for routine epidemiological survey. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency, the repeatability, and the high sensitivity of a new membrane-based concentration method (MBC: 500 mL method) for enveloped (SARS-CoV-2) and naked (FRNAPH GGII) viruses. We show that the MBC method allows the quantification and the monitoring of viruses in wastewater with a significantly improved sensitivity. In contexts of low viral circulation, we report quantifications of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at concentrations below 100 genome copies per liter and as low as 40 genome copies per liter. In highly diluted samples collected in wastewater treatment plants of French Guiana, we confirmed the accuracy of the MBC method compared to the estimations done with the C method. Finally, we demonstrate that both the C and MBC methods are compatible with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We show that the quality of the sequence is correlated with the concentration of the extracted viral genome. Of note, the quality of the sequences obtained with some MBC processed wastewater was improved by dilutions or enzyme substitutions suggesting the presence of specific enzyme inhibitors in some wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, our MBC method is the first efficient, sensitive, repeatable, and up-scalable method characterized for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and sequencing from large volumes of wastewater.\nEstimating changes in antibiotic consumption with the introduction of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States\nAuthors: Oliveira Roster, K. I.; Grad, Y.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295787\nDoxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.\nAssociations of Racial and Ethnic Composition of School Districts with Wildfire Smoke Exposure and Reduced In-Person Learning Among Schoolchildren During the Pandemic in the United States\nAuthors: Kim, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296000\nIntroduction. The White House has called for an \"all-hands-on-deck\" response to address chronic absenteeism and disrupted learning among K-12 students that spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures and shifts to remote learning in the United States. Such learning disruptions are linked to test score declines with lifelong implications for earnings and well-being. This study aimed to identify higher-risk student populations that might benefit from interventions to reduce such disruptions and related inequities by estimating the linkages between the racial and ethnic composition of U.S. K-12 school districts as predictors of average wildfire smoke levels and year-over-year declines in in-person student visits to schools during the pandemic. Methods. Using multivariable logistic regression, 5-year (2012-2016) mean percentages of non-White students grouped into quartiles were investigated as predictors of school district-level outcomes consisting of: 1) 5-year (2012-2016) mean levels of wildfire smoke fine particulate matter 2.5 m or smaller in diameter (PM2.5) above 35 g/m3 (EPA health-based standard) during school days for grade 3-8 students from August 15 to June 15 of the following year; and 2) being above the median for the mean decline in in-person student attendance (vs. the same month in 2019), from September 2020 to May 2021 and September 2021 to May 2022. Results. Across 11,190 (82.4% of all) U.S. school districts, the highest (vs. lowest) quartile for the percentage of non-White students predicted a nearly 3-fold higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=2.82; 95% CI=2.14-3.72; P\u003c.001) for high wildfire smoke exposure and a 9-fold higher odds (AOR=9.12; 95% CI=7.15-11.63; P\u003c.001) for substantially reduced in-person learning levels. Successively higher odds were observed in higher quartiles (P for trend \u003c.001). Similar patterns were seen when high (vs. low) percentages of Asian-, Black-, and Hispanic-American students were modeled simultaneously. Conclusions: U.S. school districts with higher percentages of non-White students showed a convergence of elevated odds of wildfire smoke exposure and distance learning consistent with dose-response relationships. These concomitant risks could be mitigated by school-based air filtration interventions that reduce wildfire smoke PM2.5 and transmission of airborne particulates carrying the coronavirus. One potential cost-effective intervention to address these joint risks would be the placement of Corsi-Rosenthal boxes (DIY inexpensive portable air filtration devices shown to effectively reduce PM2.5 concentrations) in school classrooms and other school indoor areas. Supplying Corsi-Rosenthal boxes to school districts could markedly reduce learning disruptions and wildfire smoke and COVID-19 health impacts and their related inequities at a cost of less than $1 billion annually, 0.5% of the $190 billion in federal relief available to school districts to address pandemic-related needs including learning loss.\n#ActuallyAutistic Twitter dataset for precision diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nAuthors: Jaiswal, A.; Washington, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295799\nThe increasing usage of social media platforms has given rise to an unprecedented surge in user- generated content with millions of users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and health-related information. Because of this social media has turned out to be a useful means to study and understand public health. Twitter is one such platform that has proven to be a valuable source of such information for both public and health officials. We present a novel dataset consisting of 6,515,470 tweets collected from users self identifying with autism using \"#ActuallyAutistic\" and a control group. The dataset also has supporting information such as posting dates, follower count, geographical location, and interaction metrics. We illustrate the utility of the dataset through common Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, tweet and user classification, and topic modeling. The textual differences in social media communications can help researchers and clinicians to conduct symptomatology studies, in natural settings, by establishing effective biomarkers to distinguish an autistic individual from their typical peers. For better accessibility, reusability and new research insights, we have released the dataset publicly.\nCaring for Terminally Ill Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review of Literature on the Stress Experienced by Family Caregivers\nAuthors: Jhang, K.; Luh, D.-L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295878\nObjectiveThis research takes previous study, Cancer family caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases: A review of the descriptive psychosocial literature, limited in recent decade, as methodology template. The purpose of this review was to organize the literature as compared to the different result of previous study. MethodAs a systematic review, major databases were searched for non-intervention descriptive studies. Psychosocial variables of family caregivers to adults with cancer during the different phases would be included. ResultThe 23 studies reviewed were conducted in ten countries and varied considerably by samples, outcome measures, and results. Despite limiting several conditions, results, such as age, gender, and relationship to the patient, were inconsistent. Across the 23 studies, 53 unique instruments were used; 13 of which were no psychometric testing. The family caregivers who were younger and faced level of daily life impairment tended to be burden, anxious, depress. To summarize the different factors influencing caregivers status, complicated grief was consistent with their situation. ConclusionAs comparewith previous study, it demonstrated inconsistent results, which were spouse, gender and age, affecting family caregivers status. However, regarding to measurement instruments using, it was much more rigorous than before. Also, it had been changed in the major study site and the number of study. As a consequence of physical and psychosocial status of family caregivers, they were in high risk population.\nAssociation of Cognitive Deficits with Sociodemographic Characteristics among Adults with Post-COVID Conditions: Findings from the United States Household Pulse Survey\nAuthors: Wu, D. J.; Liu, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295981\nBackground People infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions. Results Among individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states. Conclusions The risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.\nEffectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccination in Children Aged 5-17 Years in the United States\nAuthors: Ogilvie, R.

ObjectiveTo estimate the effectiveness of receiving a complete primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine in US children. DesignA cohort study of children aged 5-17 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 matched with unvaccinated children. SettingParticipants identified in Optum and CVS Health insurance administrative claims databases were linked with Immunization Information System (IIS) COVID-19 vaccination records from 16 US jurisdictions between December 11, 2020, and May 31, 2022 (end date varied by database and IIS). ParticipantsVaccinated children were followed from their first BNT162b2 dose and matched to unvaccinated children on calendar date, US county of residence, and demographic and clinical factors. Censoring occurred if vaccinated children failed to receive a timely dose 2 or if unvaccinated children received any dose. ExposureBNT162b2 vaccinations were identified using IIS vaccination records and insurance claims. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTwo COVID-19 outcome definitions were evaluated: COVID-19 diagnosis in any medical setting and COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitals/emergency departments (EDs). Propensity score-weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as 1 minus HR. VE was estimated overall, within age subgroups, and within variant-specific eras. Sensitivity, negative control, and quantitative bias analyses evaluated various potential biases. ResultsThere were 453,655 eligible vaccinated children one-to-one matched to unvaccinated comparators (mean age 12 years; 50% female). COVID-19 hospitalizations/ED visits were rare in children, regardless of vaccination status (Optum, 41.2 per 10,000 person-years; CVS Health, 44.1 per 10,000 person-years). Overall, vaccination was associated with reduced incidence of any medically diagnosed COVID-19 (meta-analyzed VE = 38% [95% CI, 36%-40%]) and hospital/ED-diagnosed COVID-19 (meta-analyzed VE = 61% [95% CI, 56%-65%]). VE estimates were lowest among children 5-11 years and during the omicron variant era. Conclusions and RelevanceReceipt of a complete BNT162b2 vaccine primary series was associated with overall reduced medically diagnosed COVID-19 and hospital/ED-diagnosed COVID-19 in children; observed VE estimates differed by age group and variant era. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes receiving a complete primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine reduce COVID-19 diagnoses and ED visits/hospitalizations in children aged 5-17 years? FindingsIn this cohort study evaluating vaccination records and medical encounters from 827,149 children, recipients of a complete primary series of BNT162b2 generally had lower rates of COVID-19 diagnoses and ED visits/hospitalizations than unvaccinated children. Vaccine effectiveness was lower in children aged 5-11 years and during omicron variant predominance. MeaningReceiving a primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 diagnoses; changing variants and younger age groups may require further evaluations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology is experiencing exponential development. Despite undeniable advantages compared to patient-centered approaches (cost, anonymity, survey of large populations without bias, detection of asymptomatic infected peoples etc), major technical limitations persist. Among them is the low sensitivity of the current methods used for quantifying and sequencing viral genomes from wastewater. In situations of low viral circulation, during initial stages of viral emergences, or in countries experiencing heavy rains, the extremely low concentrations of viruses in wastewater may fall below the limit of detection of the current methods. The availability and cost of the commercial kits, as well as the requirement of expensive materials, can also present major blocks to the development of wastewater-based epidemiological survey, specifically in low-income countries. Thereby, highly sensitive, low cost and open-access methods are still needed to increase the predictability of the viral emergences, to survey low-circulating viruses and to allow wastewater-based surveillance. Here, we outline and characterize new protocols for concentrating, quantifying, monitoring, and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes (500 mL-1L) of raw wastewater. Our nucleic acid extraction technique (the routine C: 5ml method) does not require sophisticated equipment such as automatons and is not reliant on commercial kits, making it readily available to a broader range of laboratories for routine epidemiological survey. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency, the repeatability, and the high sensitivity of a new membrane-based concentration method (MBC: 500 mL method) for enveloped (SARS-CoV-2) and naked (FRNAPH GGII) viruses. We show that the MBC method allows the quantification and the monitoring of viruses in wastewater with a significantly improved sensitivity. In contexts of low viral circulation, we report quantifications of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at concentrations below 100 genome copies per liter and as low as 40 genome copies per liter. In highly diluted samples collected in wastewater treatment plants of French Guiana, we confirmed the accuracy of the MBC method compared to the estimations done with the C method. Finally, we demonstrate that both the C and MBC methods are compatible with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We show that the quality of the sequence is correlated with the concentration of the extracted viral genome. Of note, the quality of the sequences obtained with some MBC processed wastewater was improved by dilutions or enzyme substitutions suggesting the presence of specific enzyme inhibitors in some wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, our MBC method is the first efficient, sensitive, repeatable, and up-scalable method characterized for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and sequencing from large volumes of wastewater.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction. The White House has called for an &#34;all-hands-on-deck&#34; response to address chronic absenteeism and disrupted learning among K-12 students that spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures and shifts to remote learning in the United States. Such learning disruptions are linked to test score declines with lifelong implications for earnings and well-being. This study aimed to identify higher-risk student populations that might benefit from interventions to reduce such disruptions and related inequities by estimating the linkages between the racial and ethnic composition of U.S. K-12 school districts as predictors of average wildfire smoke levels and year-over-year declines in in-person student visits to schools during the pandemic. Methods. Using multivariable logistic regression, 5-year (2012-2016) mean percentages of non-White students grouped into quartiles were investigated as predictors of school district-level outcomes consisting of: 1) 5-year (2012-2016) mean levels of wildfire smoke fine particulate matter 2.5 m or smaller in diameter (PM2.5) above 35 g/m3 (EPA health-based standard) during school days for grade 3-8 students from August 15 to June 15 of the following year; and 2) being above the median for the mean decline in in-person student attendance (vs. the same month in 2019), from September 2020 to May 2021 and September 2021 to May 2022. Results. Across 11,190 (82.4% of all) U.S. school districts, the highest (vs. lowest) quartile for the percentage of non-White students predicted a nearly 3-fold higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=2.82; 95% CI=2.14-3.72; P&lt;.001) for high wildfire smoke exposure and a 9-fold higher odds (AOR=9.12; 95% CI=7.15-11.63; P&lt;.001) for substantially reduced in-person learning levels. Successively higher odds were observed in higher quartiles (P for trend &lt;.001). Similar patterns were seen when high (vs. low) percentages of Asian-, Black-, and Hispanic-American students were modeled simultaneously. Conclusions: U.S. school districts with higher percentages of non-White students showed a convergence of elevated odds of wildfire smoke exposure and distance learning consistent with dose-response relationships. These concomitant risks could be mitigated by school-based air filtration interventions that reduce wildfire smoke PM2.5 and transmission of airborne particulates carrying the coronavirus. One potential cost-effective intervention to address these joint risks would be the placement of Corsi-Rosenthal boxes (DIY inexpensive portable air filtration devices shown to effectively reduce PM2.5 concentrations) in school classrooms and other school indoor areas. Supplying Corsi-Rosenthal boxes to school districts could markedly reduce learning disruptions and wildfire smoke and COVID-19 health impacts and their related inequities at a cost of less than $1 billion annually, 0.5% of the $190 billion in federal relief available to school districts to address pandemic-related needs including learning loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing usage of social media platforms has given rise to an unprecedented surge in user- generated content with millions of users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and health-related information. Because of this social media has turned out to be a useful means to study and understand public health. Twitter is one such platform that has proven to be a valuable source of such information for both public and health officials. We present a novel dataset consisting of 6,515,470 tweets collected from users self identifying with autism using &#34;#ActuallyAutistic&#34; and a control group. The dataset also has supporting information such as posting dates, follower count, geographical location, and interaction metrics. We illustrate the utility of the dataset through common Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, tweet and user classification, and topic modeling. The textual differences in social media communications can help researchers and clinicians to conduct symptomatology studies, in natural settings, by establishing effective biomarkers to distinguish an autistic individual from their typical peers. For better accessibility, reusability and new research insights, we have released the dataset publicly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis research takes previous study, Cancer family caregivers during the palliative, hospice, and bereavement phases: A review of the descriptive psychosocial literature, limited in recent decade, as methodology template. The purpose of this review was to organize the literature as compared to the different result of previous study.

MethodAs a systematic review, major databases were searched for non-intervention descriptive studies. Psychosocial variables of family caregivers to adults with cancer during the different phases would be included.

ResultThe 23 studies reviewed were conducted in ten countries and varied considerably by samples, outcome measures, and results. Despite limiting several conditions, results, such as age, gender, and relationship to the patient, were inconsistent. Across the 23 studies, 53 unique instruments were used; 13 of which were no psychometric testing. The family caregivers who were younger and faced level of daily life impairment tended to be burden, anxious, depress. To summarize the different factors influencing caregivers status, complicated grief was consistent with their situation.

ConclusionAs comparewith previous study, it demonstrated inconsistent results, which were spouse, gender and age, affecting family caregivers status. However, regarding to measurement instruments using, it was much more rigorous than before. Also, it had been changed in the major study site and the number of study. As a consequence of physical and psychosocial status of family caregivers, they were in high risk population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background People infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions. Results Among individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states. Conclusions The risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in children in the United States; real-world assessment of vaccine effectiveness in children is needed.

ObjectiveTo estimate the effectiveness of receiving a complete primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine in US children.

DesignA cohort study of children aged 5-17 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 matched with unvaccinated children.

SettingParticipants identified in Optum and CVS Health insurance administrative claims databases were linked with Immunization Information System (IIS) COVID-19 vaccination records from 16 US jurisdictions between December 11, 2020, and May 31, 2022 (end date varied by database and IIS).

ParticipantsVaccinated children were followed from their first BNT162b2 dose and matched to unvaccinated children on calendar date, US county of residence, and demographic and clinical factors. Censoring occurred if vaccinated children failed to receive a timely dose 2 or if unvaccinated children received any dose.

ExposureBNT162b2 vaccinations were identified using IIS vaccination records and insurance claims.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTwo COVID-19 outcome definitions were evaluated: COVID-19 diagnosis in any medical setting and COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitals/emergency departments (EDs). Propensity score-weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as 1 minus HR. VE was estimated overall, within age subgroups, and within variant-specific eras. Sensitivity, negative control, and quantitative bias analyses evaluated various potential biases.

ResultsThere were 453,655 eligible vaccinated children one-to-one matched to unvaccinated comparators (mean age 12 years; 50% female). COVID-19 hospitalizations/ED visits were rare in children, regardless of vaccination status (Optum, 41.2 per 10,000 person-years; CVS Health, 44.1 per 10,000 person-years). Overall, vaccination was associated with reduced incidence of any medically diagnosed COVID-19 (meta-analyzed VE = 38% [95% CI, 36%-40%]) and hospital/ED-diagnosed COVID-19 (meta-analyzed VE = 61% [95% CI, 56%-65%]). VE estimates were lowest among children 5-11 years and during the omicron variant era.

Conclusions and RelevanceReceipt of a complete BNT162b2 vaccine primary series was associated with overall reduced medically diagnosed COVID-19 and hospital/ED-diagnosed COVID-19 in children; observed VE estimates differed by age group and variant era.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes receiving a complete primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine reduce COVID-19 diagnoses and ED visits/hospitalizations in children aged 5-17 years?

FindingsIn this cohort study evaluating vaccination records and medical encounters from 827,149 children, recipients of a complete primary series of BNT162b2 generally had lower rates of COVID-19 diagnoses and ED visits/hospitalizations than unvaccinated children. Vaccine effectiveness was lower in children aged 5-11 years and during omicron variant predominance.

MeaningReceiving a primary series of monovalent BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 diagnoses; changing variants and younger age groups may require further evaluations.</p>
