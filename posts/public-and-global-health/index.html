MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nPan-Enterovirus Characterization Reveals Cryptic Circulation of Clinically Relevant Subtypes in Arizona Wastewater\nAuthors: Erickson, D. E.; Simmons, K. M.; Barrand, Z. A.; Ridenour, C. L.; Hawkinson, P. B.; Lemke, L.; Sellner, S. P.; Brock, B. N.; Rivas, A. N.; Sheridan, K.; Lemmer, D.; Yaglom, H. D.; Porter, W.

M.; Hep\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23297677\nBackgroundMost seasonally circulating enteroviruses result in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease. ObjectiveThe overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics. MethodsThis study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July- October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach. ResultsIn the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis revealed just one importation into the state led to local circulation. SignificanceThis study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms. IMPACT STATEMENTMuch of our response to infectious disease threats is reactive, even in the case of seasonally circulating viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been successfully used for mitigation purposes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and has potential to be implemented for other pathogens that can cause severe infections. While vaccines and treatment beyond supportive care are not available for many infections, this method of surveillance can provide situational awareness to public health agencies, medical professionals, and the general population, possibly paving the way for earlier public health response.\nGeographic accessibility to public healthcare facilities and spatial clustering during the wet and dry seasons in Cote d'Ivoire\nAuthors: Sehi, G. T.; Houngbedji, C. A.; Parker, D. M.; Macharia, P. M.\nScore: 27.9, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298865\nIntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations. MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([\u0026ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices. ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons. ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access. Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare. C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility. C_LI What this study addsO_LIIn the dry season, the mean travel time to the nearest healthcare facility at the national level is approximately 1.8 hours, whereas in the wet season, it increases to 3.4 hours. C_LIO_LIOver 80% of the population can reach a healthcare facility within 2 hours during the dry season, but only 66% can do so during the wet season. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policy.O_LIPolicymakers can use this study to develop policies that address seasonal variations in accessibility, ensuring that healthcare services remain accessible even during adverse weather conditions. C_LI\nSocial determinants of adult COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake in a Brazilian urban informal community: a longitudinal time-to-event study\nAuthors: Dorion, M.; Ticona, J. P. A.; Fofana, M. O.; Lind, M. L.; Nery, N.; Victoriano, R.; Do Aragao Filho, A. S.; Reis, M. G.; Costa, F.; Ko, A. I.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23298927\nResidents of informal urban settlements have a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and have less access to medical care, making vaccine-driven prevention critical in this vulnerable population. Despite robust vaccination campaigns in Brazil, vaccine uptake and timing continue to be influenced by social factors and contribute to health disparities. To address this, we conducted a sequential survey in a cohort of 717 adults in an urban favela in Salvador, Brazil where participants were interviewed in 2020, before vaccines were rolled out, and in 2022, after primary and booster dose distribution. We collected data on demographics, social characteristics, and COVID-19 vaccination status and intent. Primary series uptake was high (91.10% for 1st dose and 94.74% for 2nd dose among eligible); however, booster uptake was lower (63.51% of eligible population) at the time of the second interview, suggesting a decreasing interest in vaccination. To account for both vaccine refusal and delays, we conducted a Cox time-to-event analysis of dose uptake using sequential independent outcomes. Exposure times were determined by dose eligibility date to account for age and comorbidities. Intent to vaccinate in 2020 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54, CI: [1.05, 1.98]) and age (HR: 1.27, CI: [1.01, 2.08]) were associated with higher vaccination rates for the 1st dose. Males were less likely to receive the 1st dose (HR: 0.61, CI: [0.35, 0.83]), and, compared to catholics, 2nd dose uptake was lower for those identifying with Pentecostalism (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]) and without a religion (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]), with the latter association disappearing after controlling by age. Risk perception was associated with 2nd dose uptake (HR: 1.15, CI: [1.08, 1.26]). The role of sex and religion in vaccination behavior highlights the need for targeted outreach and interfacing with local organizations. The data offers lessons to build a long-term COVID-19 vaccination strategy beyond availability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized.

MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience.

ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMost seasonally circulating enteroviruses result in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease.

ObjectiveThe overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics.

MethodsThis study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July- October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach.

ResultsIn the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis revealed just one importation into the state led to local circulation.

SignificanceThis study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms.

IMPACT STATEMENTMuch of our response to infectious disease threats is reactive, even in the case of seasonally circulating viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been successfully used for mitigation purposes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and has potential to be implemented for other pathogens that can cause severe infections. While vaccines and treatment beyond supportive care are not available for many infections, this method of surveillance can provide situational awareness to public health agencies, medical professionals, and the general population, possibly paving the way for earlier public health response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations.

MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([&amp;ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices.

ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons.

ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access.

Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare.
C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility.

        <p class="abstract">Residents of informal urban settlements have a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and have less access to medical care, making vaccine-driven prevention critical in this vulnerable population. Despite robust vaccination campaigns in Brazil, vaccine uptake and timing continue to be influenced by social factors and contribute to health disparities. To address this, we conducted a sequential survey in a cohort of 717 adults in an urban favela in Salvador, Brazil where participants were interviewed in 2020, before vaccines were rolled out, and in 2022, after primary and booster dose distribution. We collected data on demographics, social characteristics, and COVID-19 vaccination status and intent. Primary series uptake was high (91.10% for 1st dose and 94.74% for 2nd dose among eligible); however, booster uptake was lower (63.51% of eligible population) at the time of the second interview, suggesting a decreasing interest in vaccination. To account for both vaccine refusal and delays, we conducted a Cox time-to-event analysis of dose uptake using sequential independent outcomes. Exposure times were determined by dose eligibility date to account for age and comorbidities. Intent to vaccinate in 2020 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54, CI: [1.05, 1.98]) and age (HR: 1.27, CI: [1.01, 2.08]) were associated with higher vaccination rates for the 1st dose. Males were less likely to receive the 1st dose (HR: 0.61, CI: [0.35, 0.83]), and, compared to catholics, 2nd dose uptake was lower for those identifying with Pentecostalism (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]) and without a religion (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]), with the latter association disappearing after controlling by age. Risk perception was associated with 2nd dose uptake (HR: 1.15, CI: [1.08, 1.26]). The role of sex and religion in vaccination behavior highlights the need for targeted outreach and interfacing with local organizations. The data offers lessons to build a long-term COVID-19 vaccination strategy beyond availability.</p>
