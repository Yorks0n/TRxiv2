ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR. ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization. ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [\u0026ge;]7 days after the second dose. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.\nRisk of COVID-19 death in adults who received booster COVID-19 vaccinations: national retrospective cohort study on 14.6 million people in England\nAuthors: Ward, I. L.; Robertson, C.; Agrawal, U.; Patterson, L.; Bradley, D. T.; Shi, T.; de Lusignan, S.; Hobbs, R.; Sheikh, A.; Nafilyan, V.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23291596\nImportanceThe emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths. ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths. ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death. FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council. Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022? Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow). Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.\nA unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk\nAuthors: Jermy, B.; Läll, K.; Wolford, B.

R.; Neale, B.; Hveem, K.; Mägi, R.; Palotie, A.; Heyne, H.; Mars, N.; Ganna, A.; Ripatti, S.\nScore: 36.9, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291186\nPolygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.\nA review of scientific theories used to justify the delivery of school-based mindfulness programmes . A protocol for a scoping review\nAuthors: Abbott, P. A.; Nixon, G.; Stanley, I.; D'Ambruoso, L.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291616\nBackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing. MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team. DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.\nIntention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Benin and Senegal: a structural equation modelling (SEM)\nAuthors: GAYE, I.; Ridde, V.; Avahoundjea, E.; BA, M. F.; DOSSOU, J. p.; Diallo, A. I.; FAYE, A.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292061\nIntroductionVaccination is considered one of the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a small proportion of the population was fully vaccinated in Benin (20.9%) and Senegal (7.6%) by December 2022. This study explores the determinants of intent to vaccinate. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of 865 Beninese and 607 Senegalese aged 18 years and older. Marginal quota sampling by age, gender and region was adopted. Data collection, using a survey instrument based on the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) method, was conducted from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, in Senegal and from March 29 to May 14, 2021, in Benin. The questionnaire used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). The influence of factors was tested using a structural equation model. All analyses were conducted in R. ResultsResults show that a good perception of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen =0.33***; {beta}Ben=0.12***), a positive attitude ({beta}sen=0.22***; {beta}Ben=0.20***), and sensitivity to subjective norms ({beta}sen=0.19***; {beta}Ben=0.32***) positively influence the intention to vaccinate. Low trust in health care providers ({beta}sen=-0.40***; {beta}Ben=-0.36***) amplifies the perceived risk of vaccination ({beta}sen=-0.14***; {beta}Ben=-0.25***), which negatively impacts intention to vaccinate. Perceived vaccine efficacy was affected by perceived risk ({beta}sen=-0.12***; {beta}Ben=-0.05***) of the disease and improved by good apprehension of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen=0.60***; {beta}Ben=0.13***). Aspects related to behavioral control, vaccine information seeking, efficacy, or fairness did not appear as correlates of vaccine intention (P\u003e0.05). ConclusionBeninese and Senegalese public health authorities could develop additional intervention strategies to improve immunization coverage by considering these influencing factors, the basis of which could be better understood through subsequent qualitative studies.\nSTRESS, ANXIETY AND PTSD PREVALENCE AMONG UKRAINIANS GREW DRAMATICALLY DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF RUSSIAN INVASION: RESULTS OF NATIONWIDE SURVEY\nAuthors: Lushchak, O.; Velykodna, M.; Bolman, S.; Strilbytska, O.; Berezovskyi, V.; Storey, K. B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291803\nBackgroundIn February 2022 the Russian federation started a new invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the ongoing war since 2014. After nine years of war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health state of Ukrainians requires systematic monitoring and relevant action. MethodsThis study was designed as an online survey arranged in the 9-12 months after the start of the new invasion of Ukraine and includes sociodemographic data collection, evaluation of stress intensity by PSS-10, anxiety with GAD-7, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder with PCL-5. The sample size of 3173 Ukrainians consisted of 1954 (61.6%) respondents that were not displaced persons (NDPs), 505 (15.9%) internally displaced persons within Ukraine (IDPs), and 714 (22.5%) refugees that left Ukraine. FindingsModerate and high stress was prevalent among 64.7% and 15.5% of NDPs, 64.4% and 21.6% of IDPs, and 68.2% and 25.2% of refugees, respectively. Moderate and severe anxiety was prevalent among 25.6% and 19.0% of NDPs, 25.7% and 23.4% of IDPs, and 26.2% and 25.8% of refugees. High levels of PTSD (33 and higher) were prevalent among 32.8% of NDPs, 39.4% of IDPs, and 47.2% of refugees. DSM-V criteria for PTSD diagnosis was met by 50.8% of NDPs, 55.4% of IDPs, and 62.2% of refugees. InterpretationsThe lowest stress, anxiety, and PTSD severity was observed among NDPs, with significantly higher levels among IDPs and the highest among refugees. Being forcibly displaced from the previous living area and, especially, entering a new cultural environment significantly contributes to the mental health issues caused by war exposure, particularly for people who have directly witnessed the results of war. FundingsMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreviously published evidence suggested an increase and specificity of stress, anxiety, and PTSD prevalence among Ukrainians by August 2022. Some research provided a data comparison between IDPs and refugees. However, to date, no study has reported a comparison of three groups of Ukrainians: NDPs, IDPs, and refugees abroad. Added value of this studyThis is the first study that provides evidence of the mental health state of Ukrainians after 9-12 months of the Russian invasion in 2022. Furthermore, the research presented was designed as a nationwide survey involving three groups for comparison: NDPs and IDPs within Ukraine, and refugees in other countries. The results of the study show a significant difference between these groups in stress, anxiety, and prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Implications of all available evidenceThe present study contributes to the comprehension of the dynamics in mental health of Ukrainians in response to the war. This data will be helpful both in mental health strategy development by governmental and international policy and in the local clinical work of mental health professionals working with Ukrainians.\nSOCIAL MEDIA AS AN INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION TOOL FOR RABIES PREVENTION: AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY\nAuthors: Verma, J.; Agarwal, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291848\nIntroductionRabies is a fatal disease that can be avoided by treating animal bites promptly. Hence, post-exposure prophylaxis is critical. As a result, the National Rabies Control Program was approved under the 12th five-year plan. One of its strategies is to engage in Information, Education and Communication activities. Social media provides an opportunity for the quick and easy dissemination of research but is constrained by a lack of peer review and the risk of misinterpretation. The efficacy of a novel social media-based knowledge dissemination strategy for rabies prevention was tested in this study. MethodsAn experimental study design was followed, wherein 144 preclinical medical students were included in each control and test group. The test group was administered the intervention, which exposed the participants to health education material via social media across a span of 30 days. Participants knowledge, attitude, and practices were observed before and after the study duration. ResultsThere was no significant change in the responses of the control (chi-square statistic = 2.46, p-value = 0.96) and test (chi-square statistic = 1.64, p-value = 0.98) groups across the study duration. A comparison of the change in responses between the two groups revealed an insignificant difference (chi-square statistic = 1.29, p-value = 0.73). ConclusionSocial media is an ineffective strategy for improvements in health literacy over a short duration. Such strategies need further validation for longer durations. Moreover, the effectiveness of the health education material itself needs to be assessed.\nRegulation of Medical Devices in Zimbabwe: A qualitative study with key stakeholders\nAuthors: Chiku, C.; Maruta, T.; Manasa, J.; Mbiba, F.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.23291092\nIntroductionMedical devices play a crucial role in promoting public health. However, there is a disparity in the availability and readiness of medical device regulations in Resource-Limited Settings (RLS) compared to the global average. We conducted a study to explore the medical device regulation landscape and stakeholder perceptions in Zimbabwe. MethodologyBetween June and November 2022, we administered questionnaires to representatives of the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ), the Medical Laboratory and Clinical Scientists Council of Zimbabwe (MLCScCZ), and the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 national-level critical stakeholders from these institutions to understand the current status of medical device regulations and the relationships between them. Additionally, we interviewed regulators from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, Tanzania, and World Health Organisation to learn about best practices in transitioning to medical device regulations. We used a thematic approach and an inductively developed common coding framework to analyse emerging themes. ResultsOur findings indicate that the current legal framework needs to be revised to regulate medical devices effectively, as it does not specify the institution(s) responsible for regulating them. While the MCAZ regulates condoms and gloves, the MLCScCZ coordinates with the NMRL to register In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices for priority diseases. Other medical devices are not regulated. Furthermore, conformity assessments for product registration are not proportional to the risk classification of medical devices, and post-market surveillance activities are ineffective. Stakeholders recognise the need to collaborate and improve the regulation of medical devices. ConclusionZimbabwe must improve its regulatory framework for medical devices to ensure that safe medical devices of acceptable quality and performance are accessible. A solid legal foundation is necessary for harmonisation and reliance practices to reduce the regulatory burden on economic operators and ease the workload on regulators.\nRisk and rates of hospitalisation in young children: a prospective study of a South African birth cohort\nAuthors: Wedderburn, C. J.; Bondar, J.; Lake, M. T.; Nhapi, R.; Barnett, W.; Nicol, M. P.; Goddard, L.; Zar, H. J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23289961\nIntroductionChildren in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality; there is also a growing vulnerable population of children who are HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU). Understanding reasons and risk factors for early-life child hospitalisation will help optimise interventions to improve health outcomes. We investigated hospitalisations from birth to two years in a South African birth cohort. MethodsMother-child pairs in the Drakenstein Child Health Study were followed from birth to two years with active surveillance for hospital admission and investigation of aetiology and outcome. Incidence, duration, cause, and factors associated with child hospitalisation were investigated, and compared between HEU and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children ResultsOf 1136 children (247 HEU; 889 HUU), 314 (28%) children were hospitalised in 430 episodes despite \u003e98% childhood vaccination coverage. The highest hospitalisation rate was from 0-6 months, decreasing thereafter; 20% (84/430) of hospitalisations occurred in neonates at birth. Amongst hospitalisations subsequent to discharge after birth, 83% (288/346) had an infectious cause; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was the most common cause (49%;169/346) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) responsible for 31% of LRTIs; from 0-6 months, RSV-LRTI accounted for 22% (36/164) of all-cause hospitalisations. HIV exposure was a risk factor for hospitalisation in infants (IRR 1.63 [95% CI 1.29-2.05]) and longer hospital admission (p=0.004). Prematurity (HR 2.82 [95% CI 2.28-3.49]), delayed infant vaccinations (1.43 [1.12-1.82]), or raised maternal HIV viral load in HEU infants were risk factors; breastfeeding was protective (0.69 [0.53-0.90]). ConclusionChildren in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation in early life. Infectious causes, especially RSV-LRTI, underly most hospital admissions. HEU children are at particular risk in infancy. Available strategies such as promoting breastfeeding, timely vaccination, and optimising antenatal maternal HIV care should be strengthened. New interventions to prevent RSV may have a large additional impact in reducing hospitalisation. KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe Sustainable Development Goals highlight the need to prevent child morbidity and mortality. However, there are limited recent data on hospitalisation rates and determinants in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including in children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), despite this region having the highest under-5 mortality rate. C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU represent a growing vulnerable population in SSA. C_LI What are the new findings?O_LIEarly-life hospitalisation occurred in 28% of children in our cohort, most frequently in the first 6 months of life, despite high vaccination coverage including the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and excluding paediatric HIV infection. C_LIO_LIInfectious causes represented 83% of hospital admissions after birth; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused most hospitalisations (49%), with RSV accounting for 31% of episodes. In the first 6 months of life RSV-LRTI was responsible for 22% of all-cause hospitalisations and for 41% of LRTI hospitalisations. C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU had higher rates of hospitalisation in infancy through 12 months, compared to HIV-unexposed and uninfected children (HUU), as well as longer hospital stay. C_LIO_LIPrematurity or delayed vaccination were associated with higher risk of hospitalisation; detectable maternal HIV viral load was associated with higher hospitalisation rates in HEU children; breastfeeding was protective against hospitalisation, particularly from gastrointestinal causes. C_LI What do the new findings imply?O_LIYoung children in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation and infectious causes underly most hospital admissions. C_LIO_LIRenewed focus on measures to prevent hospitalisation in young children is needed, including interventions to encourage breastfeeding practices, timely vaccinations, optimal maternal health, and targeting at-risk children including those who are HEU or premature. C_LIO_LINew interventions against RSV-LRTI may substantially reduce hospitalisation in LMICs. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData on mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine effectiveness in children aged 6 months to 5 years are limited.

ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR.

ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization.

ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [&amp;ge;]7 days after the second dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThe emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities.

ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths.

ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths.

ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses.

Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death.

FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council.

Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022?

Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow).

Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing.

MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team.

DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccination is considered one of the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a small proportion of the population was fully vaccinated in Benin (20.9%) and Senegal (7.6%) by December 2022. This study explores the determinants of intent to vaccinate.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of 865 Beninese and 607 Senegalese aged 18 years and older. Marginal quota sampling by age, gender and region was adopted. Data collection, using a survey instrument based on the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) method, was conducted from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, in Senegal and from March 29 to May 14, 2021, in Benin. The questionnaire used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). The influence of factors was tested using a structural equation model. All analyses were conducted in R.

ResultsResults show that a good perception of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen =0.33***; {beta}Ben=0.12***), a positive attitude ({beta}sen=0.22***; {beta}Ben=0.20***), and sensitivity to subjective norms ({beta}sen=0.19***; {beta}Ben=0.32***) positively influence the intention to vaccinate. Low trust in health care providers ({beta}sen=-0.40***; {beta}Ben=-0.36***) amplifies the perceived risk of vaccination ({beta}sen=-0.14***; {beta}Ben=-0.25***), which negatively impacts intention to vaccinate. Perceived vaccine efficacy was affected by perceived risk ({beta}sen=-0.12***; {beta}Ben=-0.05***) of the disease and improved by good apprehension of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen=0.60***; {beta}Ben=0.13***). Aspects related to behavioral control, vaccine information seeking, efficacy, or fairness did not appear as correlates of vaccine intention (P&gt;0.05).

ConclusionBeninese and Senegalese public health authorities could develop additional intervention strategies to improve immunization coverage by considering these influencing factors, the basis of which could be better understood through subsequent qualitative studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn February 2022 the Russian federation started a new invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the ongoing war since 2014. After nine years of war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health state of Ukrainians requires systematic monitoring and relevant action.

MethodsThis study was designed as an online survey arranged in the 9-12 months after the start of the new invasion of Ukraine and includes sociodemographic data collection, evaluation of stress intensity by PSS-10, anxiety with GAD-7, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder with PCL-5. The sample size of 3173 Ukrainians consisted of 1954 (61.6%) respondents that were not displaced persons (NDPs), 505 (15.9%) internally displaced persons within Ukraine (IDPs), and 714 (22.5%) refugees that left Ukraine.

FindingsModerate and high stress was prevalent among 64.7% and 15.5% of NDPs, 64.4% and 21.6% of IDPs, and 68.2% and 25.2% of refugees, respectively. Moderate and severe anxiety was prevalent among 25.6% and 19.0% of NDPs, 25.7% and 23.4% of IDPs, and 26.2% and 25.8% of refugees. High levels of PTSD (33 and higher) were prevalent among 32.8% of NDPs, 39.4% of IDPs, and 47.2% of refugees. DSM-V criteria for PTSD diagnosis was met by 50.8% of NDPs, 55.4% of IDPs, and 62.2% of refugees.

InterpretationsThe lowest stress, anxiety, and PTSD severity was observed among NDPs, with significantly higher levels among IDPs and the highest among refugees. Being forcibly displaced from the previous living area and, especially, entering a new cultural environment significantly contributes to the mental health issues caused by war exposure, particularly for people who have directly witnessed the results of war.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreviously published evidence suggested an increase and specificity of stress, anxiety, and PTSD prevalence among Ukrainians by August 2022. Some research provided a data comparison between IDPs and refugees. However, to date, no study has reported a comparison of three groups of Ukrainians: NDPs, IDPs, and refugees abroad.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study that provides evidence of the mental health state of Ukrainians after 9-12 months of the Russian invasion in 2022. Furthermore, the research presented was designed as a nationwide survey involving three groups for comparison: NDPs and IDPs within Ukraine, and refugees in other countries. The results of the study show a significant difference between these groups in stress, anxiety, and prevalence of PTSD symptoms.

Implications of all available evidenceThe present study contributes to the comprehension of the dynamics in mental health of Ukrainians in response to the war. This data will be helpful both in mental health strategy development by governmental and international policy and in the local clinical work of mental health professionals working with Ukrainians.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRabies is a fatal disease that can be avoided by treating animal bites promptly. Hence, post-exposure prophylaxis is critical. As a result, the National Rabies Control Program was approved under the 12th five-year plan. One of its strategies is to engage in Information, Education and Communication activities. Social media provides an opportunity for the quick and easy dissemination of research but is constrained by a lack of peer review and the risk of misinterpretation. The efficacy of a novel social media-based knowledge dissemination strategy for rabies prevention was tested in this study.

MethodsAn experimental study design was followed, wherein 144 preclinical medical students were included in each control and test group. The test group was administered the intervention, which exposed the participants to health education material via social media across a span of 30 days. Participants knowledge, attitude, and practices were observed before and after the study duration.

ResultsThere was no significant change in the responses of the control (chi-square statistic = 2.46, p-value = 0.96) and test (chi-square statistic = 1.64, p-value = 0.98) groups across the study duration. A comparison of the change in responses between the two groups revealed an insignificant difference (chi-square statistic = 1.29, p-value = 0.73).

ConclusionSocial media is an ineffective strategy for improvements in health literacy over a short duration. Such strategies need further validation for longer durations. Moreover, the effectiveness of the health education material itself needs to be assessed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionMedical devices play a crucial role in promoting public health. However, there is a disparity in the availability and readiness of medical device regulations in Resource-Limited Settings (RLS) compared to the global average. We conducted a study to explore the medical device regulation landscape and stakeholder perceptions in Zimbabwe.

MethodologyBetween June and November 2022, we administered questionnaires to representatives of the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ), the Medical Laboratory and Clinical Scientists Council of Zimbabwe (MLCScCZ), and the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 national-level critical stakeholders from these institutions to understand the current status of medical device regulations and the relationships between them. Additionally, we interviewed regulators from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, Tanzania, and World Health Organisation to learn about best practices in transitioning to medical device regulations. We used a thematic approach and an inductively developed common coding framework to analyse emerging themes.

ResultsOur findings indicate that the current legal framework needs to be revised to regulate medical devices effectively, as it does not specify the institution(s) responsible for regulating them. While the MCAZ regulates condoms and gloves, the MLCScCZ coordinates with the NMRL to register In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices for priority diseases. Other medical devices are not regulated. Furthermore, conformity assessments for product registration are not proportional to the risk classification of medical devices, and post-market surveillance activities are ineffective. Stakeholders recognise the need to collaborate and improve the regulation of medical devices.

ConclusionZimbabwe must improve its regulatory framework for medical devices to ensure that safe medical devices of acceptable quality and performance are accessible. A solid legal foundation is necessary for harmonisation and reliance practices to reduce the regulatory burden on economic operators and ease the workload on regulators.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionChildren in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality; there is also a growing vulnerable population of children who are HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU). Understanding reasons and risk factors for early-life child hospitalisation will help optimise interventions to improve health outcomes. We investigated hospitalisations from birth to two years in a South African birth cohort.

MethodsMother-child pairs in the Drakenstein Child Health Study were followed from birth to two years with active surveillance for hospital admission and investigation of aetiology and outcome. Incidence, duration, cause, and factors associated with child hospitalisation were investigated, and compared between HEU and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children

ResultsOf 1136 children (247 HEU; 889 HUU), 314 (28%) children were hospitalised in 430 episodes despite &gt;98% childhood vaccination coverage. The highest hospitalisation rate was from 0-6 months, decreasing thereafter; 20% (84/430) of hospitalisations occurred in neonates at birth. Amongst hospitalisations subsequent to discharge after birth, 83% (288/346) had an infectious cause; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was the most common cause (49%;169/346) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) responsible for 31% of LRTIs; from 0-6 months, RSV-LRTI accounted for 22% (36/164) of all-cause hospitalisations. HIV exposure was a risk factor for hospitalisation in infants (IRR 1.63 [95% CI 1.29-2.05]) and longer hospital admission (p=0.004). Prematurity (HR 2.82 [95% CI 2.28-3.49]), delayed infant vaccinations (1.43 [1.12-1.82]), or raised maternal HIV viral load in HEU infants were risk factors; breastfeeding was protective (0.69 [0.53-0.90]).

ConclusionChildren in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation in early life. Infectious causes, especially RSV-LRTI, underly most hospital admissions. HEU children are at particular risk in infancy. Available strategies such as promoting breastfeeding, timely vaccination, and optimising antenatal maternal HIV care should be strengthened. New interventions to prevent RSV may have a large additional impact in reducing hospitalisation.

KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe Sustainable Development Goals highlight the need to prevent child morbidity and mortality. However, there are limited recent data on hospitalisation rates and determinants in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including in children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), despite this region having the highest under-5 mortality rate.
C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU represent a growing vulnerable population in SSA.
C_LI

What are the new findings?O_LIEarly-life hospitalisation occurred in 28% of children in our cohort, most frequently in the first 6 months of life, despite high vaccination coverage including the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and excluding paediatric HIV infection.
C_LIO_LIInfectious causes represented 83% of hospital admissions after birth; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused most hospitalisations (49%), with RSV accounting for 31% of episodes. In the first 6 months of life RSV-LRTI was responsible for 22% of all-cause hospitalisations and for 41% of LRTI hospitalisations.
C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU had higher rates of hospitalisation in infancy through 12 months, compared to HIV-unexposed and uninfected children (HUU), as well as longer hospital stay.
C_LIO_LIPrematurity or delayed vaccination were associated with higher risk of hospitalisation; detectable maternal HIV viral load was associated with higher hospitalisation rates in HEU children; breastfeeding was protective against hospitalisation, particularly from gastrointestinal causes.
C_LI

What do the new findings imply?O_LIYoung children in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation and infectious causes underly most hospital admissions.
C_LIO_LIRenewed focus on measures to prevent hospitalisation in young children is needed, including interventions to encourage breastfeeding practices, timely vaccinations, optimal maternal health, and targeting at-risk children including those who are HEU or premature.
C_LIO_LINew interventions against RSV-LRTI may substantially reduce hospitalisation in LMICs.
