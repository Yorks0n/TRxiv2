ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\nComparing surveyed adults with long COVID and those with just a positive test helps put COVID into perspective\nAuthors: Adams, M.; Grandpre, J.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302216\nIntroduction: Among adults who test positive for COVID-19, some develop long COVID (symptoms lasting [\u0026ge;]3 months), and some do not. We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact. Methods: Using Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states). Results: Prevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [\u0026ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [\u0026ge;]3 vaccines vs. \u003c3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%. Conclusions: Results show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.\nCore outcome sets for trials of interventions to prevent and to treat multimorbidity in low- and middle-income countries: the COSMOS study\nAuthors: Vidyasagaran, A. L.; Ayesha, R.; Boehnke, J. R.; Kirkham, J. J.; Rose, L.; Hurst, J. R.; Miranda, J. J.; Rana, R. Z.; Vedanthan, R.; Faisal, M. R.; Siddiqi, N.; The COSMOS Collaboration, Score: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301589\nIntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective evidence-based interventions. A core outcome set (COS) appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMIC contexts does not presently exist. This is required to standardise reporting and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two COS for intervention trials aimed at the prevention and treatment of multimorbidity in LMICs. MethodsTo generate a comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with multimorbidity and their caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four stakeholder groups with representation from 33 countries (people with multimorbidity/caregivers, multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers). Consensus meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS. Registration: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580. ResultsThe systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24 outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention, and six treatment outcomes were added from Delphi round one. Delphi round two surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round one participants (72.0%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4%) participants for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) Adverse events, (2) Development of new comorbidity, (3) Health risk behaviour, and (4) Quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1) Adherence to treatment, (2) Adverse events, (3) Out-of-pocket expenditure, and (4) Quality of life. ConclusionFollowing established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment, specific to LMIC contexts. We recommend their inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMICs. KEY MESSAGESWhat is already known on this topic? Although a Core Outcome Set (COS) for the study of multimorbidity has been previously developed, it does not include contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the important differences in disease patterns and healthcare systems between high-income country (HIC) and LMIC contexts, a fit-for-purpose COS for the study of multimorbidity specific to LMICs is urgently needed. What this study addsFollowing rigorous guidelines and best practice recommendations for developing COS, we have identified four core outcomes for including in trials of interventions for the prevention and four for the treatment of multimorbidity in LMIC settings. The outcomes Adverse events and Quality of life (including Health-related quality of life) featured in both prevention and treatment COS. In addition, the prevention COS included Development of new comorbidity and Health risk behaviour, whereas the treatment COS included Adherence to treatment and Out-of-pocket expenditure outcomes. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe multimorbidity prevention and treatment COS will inform future trials and intervention study designs by helping promote consistency in outcome selection and reporting. COS for multimorbidity interventions that are context-sensitive will likely contribute to reduced research waste, harmonise outcomes to be measured across trials, and advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMIC settings to enhance health outcomes for those living with multimorbidity.\nBudgeting and advocacy to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene in healthcare facilities: a case study in Nepal\nAuthors: Chettry, L. K.; Bohara, P.; Bohara, R. C.; Jajal, R. H.; Khadha, S.; Subedi, H.; Giri, D.; Sharma, S.; Dhungana, U.; van der Valen, M. T.; Brogan, J.; Anderson, D. M.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301941\nBarriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, \"WASH\") in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.\nInvestigating the changing taxonomy and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from door handles in a new infectious disease ward pre- and post-patient admittance\nAuthors: Ackers Johnson, G.; McLaughlin, D.; Doyle, A.; Lewis, J. M.; Neal, T.; Todd, S.; Roberts, A. P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302185\nBackground: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are a significant burden to health systems, with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and increased financial costs. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) further compounds the issue as viable treatment options are constrained. The hospital environment plays a significant role in the development of HAIs, with effective microbial monitoring providing the foundation for targeted interventions and improved infection prevention and control strategies. Methods: This project sampled door handles in an infectious disease ward at the newly built Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Sampling was performed prior to the first patients being admitted to the ward and then six and twelve months after this date. We also investigated the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of all Staphylococcus spp. identified. Results: Prior to patient admission, the majority of isolates identified (57%) were Staphylococcus spp., reducing to 32% and 29% at six and twelve months respectively where Bacillus spp. accounted for 51% of isolates. No ESKAPE pathogens were identified. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the Staphylococcus spp. showed the rates of resistance were relatively low for all isolates prior to patient admittance, with the exception of cefoxitin (56%). Overall, resistance was highest after six months of ward use, with only tetracycline showing an increase in resistance at each consecutive time point. Despite an increase in isolates susceptible to all antibiotics after 12 months, the rate of multi-drug resistance remained high. Summary: This study highlighted the prevalence of a resistant reservoir of bacteria recoverable on high touch surfaces, emphasising the importance of extensive cleaning protocols and efficient, ongoing, environmental surveillance.\nMetatranscriptomic analysis of wastewater sites reveals a high abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes from hospital wastewater.\nAuthors: Musundi, S.; Ng'ang'a, S.; Wanjiru, E. W.; Sagoe, K.; Wandera, E.; Kanoi, B.; Gitaka, J.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302270\nObjective This study analyzed the metatranscriptome of wastewater samples from different sites with a focus of identifying antibiotic resistance genes and the bacterial community. Methods Twenty-four wastewater samples were collected from a hospital, university sewer, and the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The metatranscriptome was sequenced to identify antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community composition. Results Metatranscriptome analysis revealed varying abundances of ARG transcripts across different sites, with 84, 27, 14, and 9 ARG transcripts identified in wastewater collected from the hospital, university, influent, and effluent of a WWTP, respectively. Notably, hospital wastewater contained clinically relevant beta-lactam ARGs, including bla-NDM-1 and several blaOXA transcripts. Four core ARGs, against sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and aminoglycosides aph(6)-ld and aph('3')-lb were also identified. The predominant bacterial community comprised of Gammaproteobacteria, with priority pathogens like Neisseria gonorrhea and Helicobacter pylori present in hospital wastewater and WWTP influent. Conclusion These findings provide insights into the wastewater resistome and how meta-transcriptomic data can be utilized for the surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Overall, our study highlights the utility of wastewater surveillance in understanding and addressing the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and emphasizes the crucial role of proper wastewater management in protecting public and environmental health.\nClimatic drivers of seasonal dynamics for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in Antananarivo, Madagascar, 2011-2021\nAuthors: RANDRIAMBOLAMANANTSOA, T. H.; RAZANAJATOVO, N. H.; RANAIVOSON, H. C.; RANDRIANASOLO, L.; RABARISON, J. H.; RAZAFINMANJATO, H.; RATSIMBAZAFY, A.; RAKOTO, D. A. D.; HERAUD, J.-M.; LACOSTE, V.; Brook, C. E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302203\nIntroduction Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a primary source of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI), the leading cause of death in children under five. Over 99% of RSV attributed deaths occur in low -income countries, including Madagascar. RSV transmission is linked to climate, driving highly seasonal dynamics. Methods We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify correlates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar from January 2011 -December 2021, then fit catalytic models to cumulative age -structured incidence to estimate age -specific force of infection (FOI). We fit a time series Susceptible Infected Recovered (TSIR) model to the dataset to estimate weekly RSV transmission, then evaluated associations with precipitation, humidity, and temperature using generalized linear models. We used GAMs to quantify interannual trends in climate and assess whether significant deviations in RSV burden occurred in years representing climatic anomalies. Results Reported RSV infections in Antananarivo were significantly associated with patient ages [\u0026le;]2 years. Highest FOI was estimated in patients [\u0026le;]1 year, with transmission declining to near-zero by age five before rising in older (60+) cohorts. TSIR models estimated a January-February peak in RSV transmission, which was strongly positively associated with precipitation and more weakly with temperature but negatively related to relative humidity. Precipitation, humidity, and temperature all increased across the study period in Antananarivo, while reported RSV infections remained stable. Significant deviations in RSV burden were not associated with clear climate anomalies. Conclusions Stable rates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo across the past decade may reflect contrasting impacts of elevated precipitation and increased humidity on transmission. If future climate changes yield more rapidly accelerating precipitation than humidity, this could accelerate RSV burden. Introduction of recently-developed public health interventions to combat RSV in low income settings like Madagascar is essential to mitigating burden of disease (RSV), in particular any future climate-driven increases in transmission or severity.\nFactors associated with decreased anal sphincter tone and the accuracy of forced anal examinations to detect individuals having receptive anal intercourse: An observational study\nAuthors: Nyitray, A.; Rosser, B. R. S.; Hazra, A.; Nitkowski, J.; Smith, D.; Brzezinski, B.; Ridolfi, T. J.; Schneider, J.; Chiao, E. Y.; Sanos, S.; Mkonyi, E.; Mgopa, L. R.; Ross, M. W.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302098\nObjective and DesignForced anal examinations are used to prosecute sexual and gender minorities (SGM) in at least seven countries under the presumption that decreased sphincter tone, estimated by a finger inserted into the anal canal, can detect persons practicing receptive anal intercourse. In a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from a longitudinal study, we aimed to determine factors associated with sphincter tone and the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect persons engaging in receptive anal intercourse. SettingClinicians in Chicago, Houston, and Milwaukee, USA conducted digital anal rectal examinations (DARE) on 838 participants, 94.0% of whom were cisgendered males. Clinicians used the Digital Rectal Examination Scoring System to score sphincter resting tone (RT) and squeeze tone (ST). On a separate survey, individuals reported their preferred position for anal intercourse: i.e., either always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, always/mostly receptive anal intercourse, or both receptive and insertive anal intercourse. Multivariable regression assessed factors associated with decreased sphincter tone while area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC) estimated the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect receptive anal intercourse. Results11.3% had decreased RT (95/838) and 6.3% had decreased ST (53/838). The accuracy of DARE to detect any receptive anal intercourse was little better than random guessing (AUC 0.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.55, and AUC 0.51, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.53, respectively. RT and ST decreased with age regardless of sexual behavior (ptrend\u003c0.01 for both). Compared to individuals having always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, individuals having always/mostly receptive anal intercourse was associated with decreased RT, but not ST, while those equally preferring both insertive and receptive anal intercourse were not associated with decreased RT or ST. ConclusionsDecreased sphincter tone is uncommon among SGM who prefer receptive anal intercourse. Given virtually no accuracy, a finger inserted into the anus has no utility to detect individuals practicing receptive anal intercourse and thus should not be used as such. Trial registrationNCT04090060 Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSTo gather evidence for prosecution of sexual and gender minorities, forced anal exams are used in multiple countries. The examination includes inserting the index finger into the anal canal to detect decreased sphincter tone which is considered evidence of receptive anal intercourse. We found only two small studies (n= 58 and n=24) assessing factors associated with decreased sphincter tone and none assessing the accuracy of sphincter tone to detect sexual and gender minorities having receptive anal intercourse. What this study addsOur study suggests that a finger inserted into the anal canal is not useful to detect a history of receptive anal intercourse. As such, the sexual practices of individuals cannot be known using a forced anal examination.\nInformation Bottlenecks in Forecasting COVID-19\nAuthors: Gamarnik, D.; Ma, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24302003\nReliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate. In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20+ days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the \"memoryless\" property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.\nAn ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties\nAuthors: Ali, S.; Azarian, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301823\nBackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves. MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors. ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p \u003c 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure.

ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States.

DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline.

Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems.

Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines.

ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children.

ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Among adults who test positive for COVID-19, some develop long COVID (symptoms lasting [&amp;ge;]3 months), and some do not. We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact. Methods: Using Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states). Results: Prevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [&amp;ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [&amp;ge;]3 vaccines vs. &lt;3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%. Conclusions: Results show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective evidence-based interventions. A core outcome set (COS) appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMIC contexts does not presently exist. This is required to standardise reporting and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two COS for intervention trials aimed at the prevention and treatment of multimorbidity in LMICs.

MethodsTo generate a comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with multimorbidity and their caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four stakeholder groups with representation from 33 countries (people with multimorbidity/caregivers, multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers). Consensus meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS. Registration: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580.

ResultsThe systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24 outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention, and six treatment outcomes were added from Delphi round one. Delphi round two surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round one participants (72.0%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4%) participants for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) Adverse events, (2) Development of new comorbidity, (3) Health risk behaviour, and (4) Quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1) Adherence to treatment, (2) Adverse events, (3) Out-of-pocket expenditure, and (4) Quality of life.

ConclusionFollowing established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment, specific to LMIC contexts. We recommend their inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMICs.

KEY MESSAGESWhat is already known on this topic? Although a Core Outcome Set (COS) for the study of multimorbidity has been previously developed, it does not include contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the important differences in disease patterns and healthcare systems between high-income country (HIC) and LMIC contexts, a fit-for-purpose COS for the study of multimorbidity specific to LMICs is urgently needed.


What this study addsFollowing rigorous guidelines and best practice recommendations for developing COS, we have identified four core outcomes for including in trials of interventions for the prevention and four for the treatment of multimorbidity in LMIC settings.
The outcomes  Adverse events and  Quality of life (including Health-related quality of life) featured in both prevention and treatment COS. In addition, the prevention COS included  Development of new comorbidity and  Health risk behaviour, whereas the treatment COS included  Adherence to treatment and  Out-of-pocket expenditure outcomes.


How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe multimorbidity prevention and treatment COS will inform future trials and intervention study designs by helping promote consistency in outcome selection and reporting.
COS for multimorbidity interventions that are context-sensitive will likely contribute to reduced research waste, harmonise outcomes to be measured across trials, and advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMIC settings to enhance health outcomes for those living with multimorbidity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Barriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, &#34;WASH&#34;) in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are a significant burden to health systems, with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and increased financial costs. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) further compounds the issue as viable treatment options are constrained. The hospital environment plays a significant role in the development of HAIs, with effective microbial monitoring providing the foundation for targeted interventions and improved infection prevention and control strategies. Methods: This project sampled door handles in an infectious disease ward at the newly built Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Sampling was performed prior to the first patients being admitted to the ward and then six and twelve months after this date. We also investigated the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of all Staphylococcus spp. identified. Results: Prior to patient admission, the majority of isolates identified (57%) were Staphylococcus spp., reducing to 32% and 29% at six and twelve months respectively where Bacillus spp. accounted for 51% of isolates. No ESKAPE pathogens were identified. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the Staphylococcus spp. showed the rates of resistance were relatively low for all isolates prior to patient admittance, with the exception of cefoxitin (56%). Overall, resistance was highest after six months of ward use, with only tetracycline showing an increase in resistance at each consecutive time point. Despite an increase in isolates susceptible to all antibiotics after 12 months, the rate of multi-drug resistance remained high. Summary: This study highlighted the prevalence of a resistant reservoir of bacteria recoverable on high touch surfaces, emphasising the importance of extensive cleaning protocols and efficient, ongoing, environmental surveillance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective This study analyzed the metatranscriptome of wastewater samples from different sites with a focus of identifying antibiotic resistance genes and the bacterial community. Methods Twenty-four wastewater samples were collected from a hospital, university sewer, and the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The metatranscriptome was sequenced to identify antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community composition. Results Metatranscriptome analysis revealed varying abundances of ARG transcripts across different sites, with 84, 27, 14, and 9 ARG transcripts identified in wastewater collected from the hospital, university, influent, and effluent of a WWTP, respectively. Notably, hospital wastewater contained clinically relevant beta-lactam ARGs, including bla-NDM-1 and several blaOXA transcripts. Four core ARGs, against sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and aminoglycosides aph(6)-ld and aph(&#39;3&#39;)-lb were also identified. The predominant bacterial community comprised of Gammaproteobacteria, with priority pathogens like Neisseria gonorrhea and Helicobacter pylori present in hospital wastewater and WWTP influent. Conclusion These findings provide insights into the wastewater resistome and how meta-transcriptomic data can be utilized for the surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Overall, our study highlights the utility of wastewater surveillance in understanding and addressing the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and emphasizes the crucial role of proper wastewater management in protecting public and environmental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a primary source of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI), the leading cause of death in children under five. Over 99% of RSV attributed deaths occur in low -income countries, including Madagascar. RSV transmission is linked to climate, driving highly seasonal dynamics. Methods We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify correlates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar from January 2011 -December 2021, then fit catalytic models to cumulative age -structured incidence to estimate age -specific force of infection (FOI). We fit a time series Susceptible Infected Recovered (TSIR) model to the dataset to estimate weekly RSV transmission, then evaluated associations with precipitation, humidity, and temperature using generalized linear models. We used GAMs to quantify interannual trends in climate and assess whether significant deviations in RSV burden occurred in years representing climatic anomalies. Results Reported RSV infections in Antananarivo were significantly associated with patient ages [&amp;le;]2 years. Highest FOI was estimated in patients [&amp;le;]1 year, with transmission declining to near-zero by age five before rising in older (60&#43;) cohorts. TSIR models estimated a January-February peak in RSV transmission, which was strongly positively associated with precipitation and more weakly with temperature but negatively related to relative humidity. Precipitation, humidity, and temperature all increased across the study period in Antananarivo, while reported RSV infections remained stable. Significant deviations in RSV burden were not associated with clear climate anomalies. Conclusions Stable rates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo across the past decade may reflect contrasting impacts of elevated precipitation and increased humidity on transmission. If future climate changes yield more rapidly accelerating precipitation than humidity, this could accelerate RSV burden. Introduction of recently-developed public health interventions to combat RSV in low income settings like Madagascar is essential to mitigating burden of disease (RSV), in particular any future climate-driven increases in transmission or severity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective and DesignForced anal examinations are used to prosecute sexual and gender minorities (SGM) in at least seven countries under the presumption that decreased sphincter tone, estimated by a finger inserted into the anal canal, can detect persons practicing receptive anal intercourse. In a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from a longitudinal study, we aimed to determine factors associated with sphincter tone and the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect persons engaging in receptive anal intercourse.

SettingClinicians in Chicago, Houston, and Milwaukee, USA conducted digital anal rectal examinations (DARE) on 838 participants, 94.0% of whom were cisgendered males. Clinicians used the Digital Rectal Examination Scoring System to score sphincter resting tone (RT) and squeeze tone (ST). On a separate survey, individuals reported their preferred position for anal intercourse: i.e., either always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, always/mostly receptive anal intercourse, or both receptive and insertive anal intercourse. Multivariable regression assessed factors associated with decreased sphincter tone while area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC) estimated the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect receptive anal intercourse.

Results11.3% had decreased RT (95/838) and 6.3% had decreased ST (53/838). The accuracy of DARE to detect any receptive anal intercourse was little better than random guessing (AUC 0.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.55, and AUC 0.51, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.53, respectively. RT and ST decreased with age regardless of sexual behavior (ptrend&lt;0.01 for both). Compared to individuals having always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, individuals having always/mostly receptive anal intercourse was associated with decreased RT, but not ST, while those equally preferring both insertive and receptive anal intercourse were not associated with decreased RT or ST.

ConclusionsDecreased sphincter tone is uncommon among SGM who prefer receptive anal intercourse. Given virtually no accuracy, a finger inserted into the anus has no utility to detect individuals practicing receptive anal intercourse and thus should not be used as such.

Trial registrationNCT04090060

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSTo gather evidence for prosecution of sexual and gender minorities, forced anal exams are used in multiple countries. The examination includes inserting the index finger into the anal canal to detect decreased sphincter tone which is considered evidence of receptive anal intercourse. We found only two small studies (n= 58 and n=24) assessing factors associated with decreased sphincter tone and none assessing the accuracy of sphincter tone to detect sexual and gender minorities having receptive anal intercourse.

What this study addsOur study suggests that a finger inserted into the anal canal is not useful to detect a history of receptive anal intercourse. As such, the sexual practices of individuals cannot be known using a forced anal examination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate.

In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20&#43; days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the &#34;memoryless&#34; property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves.

MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors.

ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p &lt; 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.</p>
