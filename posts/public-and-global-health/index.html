In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nDigital Exclusion as a barrier to accessing healthcare: A summary composite indicator and online tool to explore and quantify local differences in levels of exclusion.\nAuthors: Mee, P.; Gussy, M.; Huntley, P.; Kenny, A.; Jarratt, T.; Kenward, N.; Ward, D.; Vaughan, A.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292547\nDigital exclusion leads to marginalization and inequality. A lack of tools to measure local exclusion hampers targeted interventions. In this study a composite indicator for digital exclusion and associated toolkit was developed. Indicator variables were normalised and aggregated. Factor analysis determined indicator weightings. Local levels of claiming Guaranteed Pension Credit, unemployment and low socioeconomic status showed strong mutual correlation. Underlying constructs were identified related to socioeconomic deprivation, poor academic qualifications, lack of activity and barriers to digital access. In general, coastal areas in Lincolnshire, UK had higher levels of digital exclusion, with significant local disparities within urban areas. The Lincolnshire Digital Health toolkit assists decision-makers in understanding and addressing digital exclusion.\nSARS-CoV-2 in 30 Months, Indonesia Data Tells: Study from a Reference Laboratory in North Jakarta and Its Reflection for Regional to National COVID-19 Situation\nAuthors: Kaisar, M. M. M.; Widowati, T. A.; Kristin, H.; Jonnatan, S.; Surja, S. S.; Tjoa, E.; Wijaya, J. W.; Venna, V.; Ali, S.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293237\nAtma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia (AJCUI) COVID-19 Laboratory has become a reference testing site, which contributed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia. Through the LSSR and CARE, the Indonesian government has implemented moderate yet arguably successful policies to combat this pandemic. This study aims to assess and strengthen public health management while enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of COVID-19. We analyzed the correlation between policies enforced in controlling COVID-19 from July 2020-December 2022 to the positivity rate and viral intensity. AJCUI, DKI Jakarta, Indonesia demonstrated a similar trend in COVID-19 prevalence. Government policy on mobility restrictions has substantially reduced the positivity rate in Indonesia within the period of study. Our study interpreted that the Ct value in the positive case population of AJCUI data correlated positively with DKI Jakarta and Indonesia; subsequently, it has the potential to serve as an early warning for an anticipated wave. Despite the coverage of vaccines, AJCUI and DKI Jakarta positivity rates are shifting due to evolving virus variants. Altogether, the comprehensively recorded data would enable an understanding of COVID-19 dynamics, serve as a model for unprecedented disaster and public health management in general.\nExploring Disparities and Novel Insights into Metabo-Nutritional Comorbidities among COVID-19 Patients in Mexico\nAuthors: Lopez-Cuevas, A.; Martinez-Garcia, M.; Hernandez-Lemus, E.; de Anda-Jauregui, G.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293471\nDuring the previous years, particularly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential role of metabo-nutritional comorbidities in the severity and lethality of SARS-CoV2 infection has been widely discussed, often describing ambiguous outcomes. Here we investigate the prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients in Mexico. Using a retrospective observational study design, data was collected from official databases of COVID-19 patients admitted to public and private hospitals in Mexico City. Our study found a discordant prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients, particularly obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Discordance consists in geographic location-dependent over and under-representation phenomena, that is the prevalence of such comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was significantly over or under the reported value for the general population in each location. These findings highlight the importance of screening for metabo-nutritional comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and suggest the need for tailored interventions for this population. The study also provides insights into the complex relationships between COVID-19 and metabo-nutritional comorbidities, which may inform future research and clinical practice.\nLLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) - Plasmodium infection prevalence and genotypic markers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors from 48 districts of Uganda\nAuthors: Lynd, A. R.; Gonahasa, S.; Staedke, S. G.; Oruni, A.; Maiteki-Sebuguzi, C.; Hancock, P. A.; Knight, E.; Dorsey, G.; Opigo, J.; Yeka, A.; Katureebe, A.; Kyohere, M.; Hemingway, J.; Kamya, M. R.; McDermott, D.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293323\nBackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections. ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda. ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

E.; Tuite, A.; Fisman, D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293449\nBackground: Surveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary. Results: Testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%. Conclusions: Standardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.\nGWAS of cataract in Puerto Ricans identifies a novel large-effect variant in ITGA6\nAuthors: Shi, J.; O'Connell, J.; Hicks, B.; Wang, W.; Bryc, K.; Brady, J. J.; Vacic, V.; Freyman, W.; Abul-Husn, N. S.; Auton, A.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Shringarpure, S. S.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293173\nCataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.\nInfant and Neonatal Mortality During the Covid-19 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis From Five Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nAuthors: Wagner, Z.; Heft-Neal, S.; Wang, Z.; Jing, R.; Bendavid, E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293619\nBackground: The Covid-19 pandemic led to widespread changes to health and social institutions. The effects of the pandemic on neonatal and infant health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are poorly understood, and nationally representative data characterizing changes to health care and outcomes is only now emerging. Methods: We used nationally representative survey data with vital status and perinatal care information on 2,959,203 children born in India, Madagascar, Cambodia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Using interrupted time series models, we estimated the change in neonatal mortality (death in first 30 days of life) and infant mortality (death in first year of life) following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, controlling for granular location fixed-effects and seasonality. Findings: We analyzed 2,935,052 births (146,820 deaths) before March 2020 and 24,151 births (799 deaths) after March 2020. We estimated that infant mortality increased by 9.9 deaths per 1,000 live births after March 2020 (95% CI 5.0, 15.0; p\u003c0.01; 22% increase) and neonatal mortality increased by 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 2.4, 11.1; p\u003c0.01; 27% increase). We observe increased mortality in all study countries. We also estimated a 3.8 percentage point reduction in antenatal care use (95% CI -4.9, -2.7; p\u003c0.01) and a 5.6 percentage point reduction in facility deliveries (95% CI -7.2, -4.0; p\u003c0.01) during the pandemic. Interpretation: Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, neonatal and infant mortality are higher than expected in five LMICs. Helping LMICs resume pre-pandemic declines in neonatal and infant mortality should be a major global priority.

Therefore, I clarified the changes in mask usage and the associated reasons before and after the downgrading of the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan, and analyzed the bi-directional associations between the two. DesignLongitudinal study. MethodsOnline surveys were conducted in two waves, between April 18-19, 2023 and June 6-15, 2023, among people aged 20-69 years living in Japan. A total of 291 participants completed both the surveys. The associations between mask usage and beliefs about the reasons for mask usage were analyzed using a cross-lagged panel model. ResultsMask usage decreased slightly, but significantly, from the first to the second wave (P \u003c 0.001, Cohens d = -0.23). Of the eight beliefs regarding mask usage, slight but significant decreases were observed in terms of relief and information effects (P = 0.046, Cohens d = -0.12; P = 0.018, Cohens d = -0.14). There was a significant association between socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance (such as norm and relief) during the first wave and mask usage during the second wave [standard estimates:0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.06-0.44)]. Contrarily, mask usage during the first wave was significantly associated with the reasons for infection risk avoidance during the second wave [standard estimates:0.13 (0.03-0.24)]. ConclusionsThe impact of downgrading the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan on mask usage and the associated reasons were found to be limited. In terms of promoting or mitigating mask usage, the significance of risk communication based on socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance, such as norms and relief, was highlighted.\nImpact of four years of annually repeated indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Actellic 300CS on routinely reported malaria cases in an agricultural setting in Malawi\nAuthors: Hoek Spaans, R.; Mkumbwa, A.; Nasoni, P.; Jones, C. M.; Stanton, M. C.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.23292843\nIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention. This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi. The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified. With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period. This study shows how the consistency of a privately run IRS campaign can improve the health of employees. More research is needed on the duration and timing of IRS programmes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.

ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.

ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Digital exclusion leads to marginalization and inequality. A lack of tools to measure local exclusion hampers targeted interventions. In this study a composite indicator for digital exclusion and associated toolkit was developed. Indicator variables were normalised and aggregated. Factor analysis determined indicator weightings. Local levels of claiming Guaranteed Pension Credit, unemployment and low socioeconomic status showed strong mutual correlation. Underlying constructs were identified related to socioeconomic deprivation, poor academic qualifications, lack of activity and barriers to digital access. In general, coastal areas in Lincolnshire, UK had higher levels of digital exclusion, with significant local disparities within urban areas. The Lincolnshire Digital Health toolkit assists decision-makers in understanding and addressing digital exclusion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia (AJCUI) COVID-19 Laboratory has become a reference testing site, which contributed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia. Through the LSSR and CARE, the Indonesian government has implemented moderate yet arguably successful policies to combat this pandemic. This study aims to assess and strengthen public health management while enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of COVID-19. We analyzed the correlation between policies enforced in controlling COVID-19 from July 2020-December 2022 to the positivity rate and viral intensity. AJCUI, DKI Jakarta, Indonesia demonstrated a similar trend in COVID-19 prevalence. Government policy on mobility restrictions has substantially reduced the positivity rate in Indonesia within the period of study. Our study interpreted that the Ct value in the positive case population of AJCUI data correlated positively with DKI Jakarta and Indonesia; subsequently, it has the potential to serve as an early warning for an anticipated wave. Despite the coverage of vaccines, AJCUI and DKI Jakarta positivity rates are shifting due to evolving virus variants. Altogether, the comprehensively recorded data would enable an understanding of COVID-19 dynamics, serve as a model for unprecedented disaster and public health management in general.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the previous years, particularly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential role of metabo-nutritional comorbidities in the severity and lethality of SARS-CoV2 infection has been widely discussed, often describing ambiguous outcomes. Here we investigate the prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients in Mexico. Using a retrospective observational study design, data was collected from official databases of COVID-19 patients admitted to public and private hospitals in Mexico City. Our study found a discordant prevalence of metabo-nutritional comorbidities among COVID-19 patients, particularly obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Discordance consists in geographic location-dependent over and under-representation phenomena, that is the prevalence of such comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was significantly over or under the reported value for the general population in each location. These findings highlight the importance of screening for metabo-nutritional comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and suggest the need for tailored interventions for this population. The study also provides insights into the complex relationships between COVID-19 and metabo-nutritional comorbidities, which may inform future research and clinical practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections.

ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda.

ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

        <p class="abstract">Background: Surveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary. Results: Testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%. Conclusions: Standardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin.

        <p class="abstract">Background: The Covid-19 pandemic led to widespread changes to health and social institutions. The effects of the pandemic on neonatal and infant health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are poorly understood, and nationally representative data characterizing changes to health care and outcomes is only now emerging. Methods: We used nationally representative survey data with vital status and perinatal care information on 2,959,203 children born in India, Madagascar, Cambodia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Using interrupted time series models, we estimated the change in neonatal mortality (death in first 30 days of life) and infant mortality (death in first year of life) following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, controlling for granular location fixed-effects and seasonality. Findings: We analyzed 2,935,052 births (146,820 deaths) before March 2020 and 24,151 births (799 deaths) after March 2020. We estimated that infant mortality increased by 9.9 deaths per 1,000 live births after March 2020 (95% CI 5.0, 15.0; p&lt;0.01; 22% increase) and neonatal mortality increased by 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 2.4, 11.1; p&lt;0.01; 27% increase). We observe increased mortality in all study countries. We also estimated a 3.8 percentage point reduction in antenatal care use (95% CI -4.9, -2.7; p&lt;0.01) and a 5.6 percentage point reduction in facility deliveries (95% CI -7.2, -4.0; p&lt;0.01) during the pandemic. Interpretation: Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, neonatal and infant mortality are higher than expected in five LMICs. Helping LMICs resume pre-pandemic declines in neonatal and infant mortality should be a major global priority. Funding: National Institute of Child Health and Development (R01HD104835 PI Wagner)</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesFrom a public health perspective, it is important to clarify the associations between mask usage and the associated reasons in situations when mask usage is promoted or mitigated. Therefore, I clarified the changes in mask usage and the associated reasons before and after the downgrading of the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan, and analyzed the bi-directional associations between the two.

DesignLongitudinal study.

MethodsOnline surveys were conducted in two waves, between April 18-19, 2023 and June 6-15, 2023, among people aged 20-69 years living in Japan. A total of 291 participants completed both the surveys. The associations between mask usage and beliefs about the reasons for mask usage were analyzed using a cross-lagged panel model.

ResultsMask usage decreased slightly, but significantly, from the first to the second wave (P &lt; 0.001, Cohens d = -0.23). Of the eight beliefs regarding mask usage, slight but significant decreases were observed in terms of relief and information effects (P = 0.046, Cohens d = -0.12; P = 0.018, Cohens d = -0.14). There was a significant association between socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance (such as norm and relief) during the first wave and mask usage during the second wave [standard estimates:0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.06-0.44)]. Contrarily, mask usage during the first wave was significantly associated with the reasons for infection risk avoidance during the second wave [standard estimates:0.13 (0.03-0.24)].

ConclusionsThe impact of downgrading the legal status of COVID-19 in Japan on mask usage and the associated reasons were found to be limited. In terms of promoting or mitigating mask usage, the significance of risk communication based on socio-psychological reasons other than infection risk avoidance, such as norms and relief, was highlighted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention. This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi. The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified. With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period. This study shows how the consistency of a privately run IRS campaign can improve the health of employees. More research is needed on the duration and timing of IRS programmes.</p>
