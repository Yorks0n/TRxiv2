MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nGeographic accessibility to public healthcare facilities and spatial clustering during the wet and dry seasons in Cote d'Ivoire\nAuthors: Sehi, G. T.; Houngbedji, C. A.; Parker, D. M.; Macharia, P. M.\nScore: 27.9, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298865\nIntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations. MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([\u0026ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices. ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons. ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access. Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare. C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility. C_LI What this study addsO_LIIn the dry season, the mean travel time to the nearest healthcare facility at the national level is approximately 1.8 hours, whereas in the wet season, it increases to 3.4 hours. C_LIO_LIOver 80% of the population can reach a healthcare facility within 2 hours during the dry season, but only 66% can do so during the wet season. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policy.O_LIPolicymakers can use this study to develop policies that address seasonal variations in accessibility, ensuring that healthcare services remain accessible even during adverse weather conditions.

S.; Weston, D.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298509\nWhilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).\nAn electronic cigarette pod system delivering 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog, marketed in the United States as \"PMTA exempt\"\nAuthors: Jordt, S. E.; Jabba, S. V.; Silinski, P.; Berman, M. L.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298778\nAs of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as \"PMTA exempt\", with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing \"Metatine\", a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of \"nicotine\" within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).\nCOVID-19 infection wave mortality from surveillance data in the Philippines using machine learning\nAuthors: Migrino, J. R.; Batangan, A. R. U.; Abello, R. M. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299037\nObjectiveThe Philippines has had several COVID-19 infection waves brought about by different strains and variants of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to describe COVID-19 outcomes by infection waves using machine learning. MethodsWe used a cross-sectional surveillance data review design using the DOH COVID DataDrop data set as of September 24, 2022. We divided the data set into infection wave data sets based on the predominant COVID-19 variant(s) of concern during the identified time intervals: ancestral strain (A0), Alpha/Beta variant (AB), Delta variant (D), and Omicron variant (O). Descriptive statistics and machine learning models were generated from each infection wave data set. ResultsOur final data set consisted of 3 896 206 cases and ten attributes including one label attribute. Overall, 98.39% of cases recovered while 1.61% died. The Delta wave reported the most deaths (43.52%), while the Omicron wave reported the least (10.36%). The highest CFR was observed during the ancestral wave (2.49%), while the lowest was seen during the Omicron wave (0.61%). Higher age groups generally had higher CFRs across all infection waves. The A0, AB and D models had up to four levels with two or three splits for each node. The O model had eight levels, with up to 16 splits in some nodes. Of the ten attributes, only age was included in all the decision tree models, while region of residence was included in the O model. F-score and specificity were highest using naive Bayes in all four data sets. Area under the curve (AUC) was highest in the naive Bayes models for the A0, AB and D models, while sensitivity was highest in the decision tree models for the A0, AB and O models. DiscussionThe ancestral, Alpha/Beta and Delta variants seem to have similar transmission and mortality profiles. The Omicron variant caused lesser deaths despite being more transmissible. Age remained a significant predictor of death regardless of infection wave. We recommend constant timely analysis of available data especially during public health events and emergencies.\nSocial determinants of adult COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake in a Brazilian urban informal community: a longitudinal time-to-event study\nAuthors: Dorion, M.; Ticona, J. P. A.; Fofana, M. O.; Lind, M. L.; Nery, N.; Victoriano, R.; Do Aragao Filho, A. S.; Reis, M. G.; Costa, F.; Ko, A. I.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23298927\nResidents of informal urban settlements have a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and have less access to medical care, making vaccine-driven prevention critical in this vulnerable population. Despite robust vaccination campaigns in Brazil, vaccine uptake and timing continue to be influenced by social factors and contribute to health disparities. To address this, we conducted a sequential survey in a cohort of 717 adults in an urban favela in Salvador, Brazil where participants were interviewed in 2020, before vaccines were rolled out, and in 2022, after primary and booster dose distribution. We collected data on demographics, social characteristics, and COVID-19 vaccination status and intent. Primary series uptake was high (91.10% for 1st dose and 94.74% for 2nd dose among eligible); however, booster uptake was lower (63.51% of eligible population) at the time of the second interview, suggesting a decreasing interest in vaccination. To account for both vaccine refusal and delays, we conducted a Cox time-to-event analysis of dose uptake using sequential independent outcomes. Exposure times were determined by dose eligibility date to account for age and comorbidities. Intent to vaccinate in 2020 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54, CI: [1.05, 1.98]) and age (HR: 1.27, CI: [1.01, 2.08]) were associated with higher vaccination rates for the 1st dose. Males were less likely to receive the 1st dose (HR: 0.61, CI: [0.35, 0.83]), and, compared to catholics, 2nd dose uptake was lower for those identifying with Pentecostalism (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]) and without a religion (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]), with the latter association disappearing after controlling by age. Risk perception was associated with 2nd dose uptake (HR: 1.15, CI: [1.08, 1.26]). The role of sex and religion in vaccination behavior highlights the need for targeted outreach and interfacing with local organizations. The data offers lessons to build a long-term COVID-19 vaccination strategy beyond availability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized.

MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience.

ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations.

MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([&amp;ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices.

ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons.

ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access.

Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare.
C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility.

        <p class="abstract">Whilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).</p>

        <p class="abstract">As of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as &#34;PMTA exempt&#34;, with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing &#34;Metatine&#34;, a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of &#34;nicotine&#34; within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThe Philippines has had several COVID-19 infection waves brought about by different strains and variants of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to describe COVID-19 outcomes by infection waves using machine learning.

MethodsWe used a cross-sectional surveillance data review design using the DOH COVID DataDrop data set as of September 24, 2022. We divided the data set into infection wave data sets based on the predominant COVID-19 variant(s) of concern during the identified time intervals: ancestral strain (A0), Alpha/Beta variant (AB), Delta variant (D), and Omicron variant (O). Descriptive statistics and machine learning models were generated from each infection wave data set.

ResultsOur final data set consisted of 3 896 206 cases and ten attributes including one label attribute. Overall, 98.39% of cases recovered while 1.61% died. The Delta wave reported the most deaths (43.52%), while the Omicron wave reported the least (10.36%). The highest CFR was observed during the ancestral wave (2.49%), while the lowest was seen during the Omicron wave (0.61%). Higher age groups generally had higher CFRs across all infection waves. The A0, AB and D models had up to four levels with two or three splits for each node. The O model had eight levels, with up to 16 splits in some nodes. Of the ten attributes, only age was included in all the decision tree models, while region of residence was included in the O model. F-score and specificity were highest using naive Bayes in all four data sets. Area under the curve (AUC) was highest in the naive Bayes models for the A0, AB and D models, while sensitivity was highest in the decision tree models for the A0, AB and O models.

DiscussionThe ancestral, Alpha/Beta and Delta variants seem to have similar transmission and mortality profiles. The Omicron variant caused lesser deaths despite being more transmissible. Age remained a significant predictor of death regardless of infection wave. We recommend constant timely analysis of available data especially during public health events and emergencies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Residents of informal urban settlements have a high risk of COVID-19 exposure and have less access to medical care, making vaccine-driven prevention critical in this vulnerable population. Despite robust vaccination campaigns in Brazil, vaccine uptake and timing continue to be influenced by social factors and contribute to health disparities. To address this, we conducted a sequential survey in a cohort of 717 adults in an urban favela in Salvador, Brazil where participants were interviewed in 2020, before vaccines were rolled out, and in 2022, after primary and booster dose distribution. We collected data on demographics, social characteristics, and COVID-19 vaccination status and intent. Primary series uptake was high (91.10% for 1st dose and 94.74% for 2nd dose among eligible); however, booster uptake was lower (63.51% of eligible population) at the time of the second interview, suggesting a decreasing interest in vaccination. To account for both vaccine refusal and delays, we conducted a Cox time-to-event analysis of dose uptake using sequential independent outcomes. Exposure times were determined by dose eligibility date to account for age and comorbidities. Intent to vaccinate in 2020 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54, CI: [1.05, 1.98]) and age (HR: 1.27, CI: [1.01, 2.08]) were associated with higher vaccination rates for the 1st dose. Males were less likely to receive the 1st dose (HR: 0.61, CI: [0.35, 0.83]), and, compared to catholics, 2nd dose uptake was lower for those identifying with Pentecostalism (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]) and without a religion (HR: 0.49, CI: [0.37, 0.66]), with the latter association disappearing after controlling by age. Risk perception was associated with 2nd dose uptake (HR: 1.15, CI: [1.08, 1.26]). The role of sex and religion in vaccination behavior highlights the need for targeted outreach and interfacing with local organizations. The data offers lessons to build a long-term COVID-19 vaccination strategy beyond availability.</p>
