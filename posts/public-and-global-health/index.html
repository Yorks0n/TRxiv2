Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs, overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=3.03 (1.29-7.09)[0.6% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young.

Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections. MeaningThe results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.\nThe remarkable ups and downs of birth rate in Switzerland 2020 to 2023 in a historical context\nAuthors: Le Vu, M.; Matthes, K. L.; Staub, K.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299432\nWe follow population trends in the birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present day and place the latest developments during the Covid-19 pandemic in a historical context. The birth rate in 2022 was the lowest it has been since the 1870s, and it seems the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had each led to a temporary decline in the birth rate around 9 months after the peak of these outbreaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. The immediate shock of the global outbreak has not left a negative mark on births in Switzerland. However, during and shortly after the first two pandemic waves and partial shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus significantly more births in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among \u003e30-year-old mothers and second parities. The subsequent decline in births from January 2022 was stronger than the increase in births in 2021. The first part of the 2022 decline falls on conception months in the first half of 2021, when the vaccination campaign started in Switzerland. However, given that the proportion of young people vaccinated by summer was still small, vaccination cannot by itself explain the decline in birth rate. The second part of the 2022 decline is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in winter 2021/2022. The decline appears to continue in 2023, albeit not substantially.\nInfluenza Mortality as an Indicator of the Efficacy of COVID-Related, Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Reduce the Spread of Respiratory Infections\nAuthors: Morris, R. D.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to easily and directly evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention. We do, however, have excellent historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and factors influencing that efficacy. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, influenza mortality was reduced by 91% in the 2020-21 and 69% in the 2021-22 influenza seasons relative to historical levels. The corresponding decreases for the pediatric population were 99% and 67%. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the states 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden. ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these interventions also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs increased in proportion to the size of a states Democratic electorate. This could reflect more effective NPI strategies in states with Democratic leanings or better compliance with NPIs in those states.\nWhat is On the Menu? Towards Predicting Nutritional Quality of Food Environments\nAuthors: Seo, D.; Horn, A. L.; Abeliuk, A.; Burghardt, K.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.23299691\nUnhealthy diets are a leading cause of major chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Food environments-the physical spaces in which people access and consume food-have the potential to profoundly impact diet and related diseases. We take a step towards better understanding the nutritional quality of food environments by developing MINT: Menu Item to NutrienT model. This model utilizes under-studied data sources on recipes and generic food items, along with state-of-the-art word embedding and deep learning methods, to predict the nutrient density of never-before-seen food items using only their name as input. The model achieves an R2 = 0.77, a sub-stantial improvement over comparable models. We illustrate the utility of MINT by applying it to the Los Angeles restaurant food environment, and discover close agreement between predicted and ground truth nutrient density of restaurant menu items. This model represents a significant step towards a policy toolkit needed to precisely identify and target food environments characterized by poor nutritional quality.\nUnderstanding healthcare workers experiences of face mask and RPE use in healthcare settings: an interview study\nAuthors: Carter, H.; Sharp, A.; Davidson, L.; Foster, C.; McGuire, E.; Brown, C. S.; Weston, D.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298509\nWhilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).\n",

        <p class="abstract">We follow population trends in the birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present day and place the latest developments during the Covid-19 pandemic in a historical context. The birth rate in 2022 was the lowest it has been since the 1870s, and it seems the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had each led to a temporary decline in the birth rate around 9 months after the peak of these outbreaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. The immediate shock of the global outbreak has not left a negative mark on births in Switzerland. However, during and shortly after the first two pandemic waves and partial shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus significantly more births in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among &gt;30-year-old mothers and second parities. The subsequent decline in births from January 2022 was stronger than the increase in births in 2021. The first part of the 2022 decline falls on conception months in the first half of 2021, when the vaccination campaign started in Switzerland. However, given that the proportion of young people vaccinated by summer was still small, vaccination cannot by itself explain the decline in birth rate. The second part of the 2022 decline is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in winter 2021/2022. The decline appears to continue in 2023, albeit not substantially.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to easily and directly evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention. We do, however, have excellent historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and factors influencing that efficacy.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, influenza mortality was reduced by 91% in the 2020-21 and 69% in the 2021-22 influenza seasons relative to historical levels. The corresponding decreases for the pediatric population were 99% and 67%. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the states 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden.

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these interventions also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs increased in proportion to the size of a states Democratic electorate. This could reflect more effective NPI strategies in states with Democratic leanings or better compliance with NPIs in those states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unhealthy diets are a leading cause of major chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Food environments-the physical spaces in which people access and consume food-have the potential to profoundly impact diet and related diseases. We take a step towards better understanding the nutritional quality of food environments by developing MINT: Menu Item to NutrienT model. This model utilizes under-studied data sources on recipes and generic food items, along with state-of-the-art word embedding and deep learning methods, to predict the nutrient density of never-before-seen food items using only their name as input. The model achieves an R2 = 0.77, a sub-stantial improvement over comparable models. We illustrate the utility of MINT by applying it to the Los Angeles restaurant food environment, and discover close agreement between predicted and ground truth nutrient density of restaurant menu items. This model represents a significant step towards a policy toolkit needed to precisely identify and target food environments characterized by poor nutritional quality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).</p>
