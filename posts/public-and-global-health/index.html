  "articleBody": " Impact of Community Masking on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Ontario after Adjustment for Differential Testing by Age and Sex\nAuthors: Peng, A.; Bosco, S.; Tuite, A.; Simmons, A.; Fisman, D.\nScore: 890.6, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293155\nBackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nGWAS of cataract in Puerto Ricans identifies a novel large-effect variant in ITGA6\nAuthors: Shi, J.; O'Connell, J.; Hicks, B.; Wang, W.; Bryc, K.; Brady, J. J.; Vacic, V.; Freyman, W.; Abul-Husn, N. S.; Auton, A.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Shringarpure, S. S.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293173\nCataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.\nSARS-CoV-2 in 30 Months, Indonesia Data Tells: Study from a Reference Laboratory in North Jakarta and Its Reflection for Regional to National COVID-19 Situation\nAuthors: Kaisar, M. M. M.; Widowati, T. A.; Kristin, H.; Jonnatan, S.; Surja, S. S.; Tjoa, E.; Wijaya, J. W.; Venna, V.; Ali, S.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293237\nAtma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia (AJCUI) COVID-19 Laboratory has become a reference testing site, which contributed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia. Through the LSSR and CARE, the Indonesian government has implemented moderate yet arguably successful policies to combat this pandemic. This study aims to assess and strengthen public health management while enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of COVID-19. We analyzed the correlation between policies enforced in controlling COVID-19 from July 2020-December 2022 to the positivity rate and viral intensity. AJCUI, DKI Jakarta, Indonesia demonstrated a similar trend in COVID-19 prevalence. Government policy on mobility restrictions has substantially reduced the positivity rate in Indonesia within the period of study. Our study interpreted that the Ct value in the positive case population of AJCUI data correlated positively with DKI Jakarta and Indonesia; subsequently, it has the potential to serve as an early warning for an anticipated wave. Despite the coverage of vaccines, AJCUI and DKI Jakarta positivity rates are shifting due to evolving virus variants. Altogether, the comprehensively recorded data would enable an understanding of COVID-19 dynamics, serve as a model for unprecedented disaster and public health management in general.\nImpact of four years of annually repeated indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Actellic 300CS on routinely reported malaria cases in an agricultural setting in Malawi\nAuthors: Hoek Spaans, R.; Mkumbwa, A.; Nasoni, P.; Jones, C. M.; Stanton, M. C.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.23292843\nIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention. This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi. The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified. With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period. This study shows how the consistency of a privately run IRS campaign can improve the health of employees. More research is needed on the duration and timing of IRS programmes.\nLLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) - Plasmodium infection prevalence and genotypic markers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors from 48 districts of Uganda\nAuthors: Lynd, A. R.; Gonahasa, S.; Staedke, S. G.; Oruni, A.; Maiteki-Sebuguzi, C.; Hancock, P. A.; Knight, E.; Dorsey, G.; Opigo, J.; Yeka, A.; Katureebe, A.; Kyohere, M.; Hemingway, J.; Kamya, M. R.; McDermott, D.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293323\nIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections. Overall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda. Distribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.\nQuantification of Covid-19 Vaccine Coercion in India: A Survey Study\nAuthors: Raman, B.; Banerjee, A.; Vajjala, S. M.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293089\nIntroductionInformed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India. MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings. ResultsA total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non-students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48%-25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67%-26.14%) and non-student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% - 31.43%). ConclusionA significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent. These results are of paramount importance for future policies as well as for posterity.\n",

In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.

ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.

ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia (AJCUI) COVID-19 Laboratory has become a reference testing site, which contributed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia. Through the LSSR and CARE, the Indonesian government has implemented moderate yet arguably successful policies to combat this pandemic. This study aims to assess and strengthen public health management while enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of COVID-19. We analyzed the correlation between policies enforced in controlling COVID-19 from July 2020-December 2022 to the positivity rate and viral intensity. AJCUI, DKI Jakarta, Indonesia demonstrated a similar trend in COVID-19 prevalence. Government policy on mobility restrictions has substantially reduced the positivity rate in Indonesia within the period of study. Our study interpreted that the Ct value in the positive case population of AJCUI data correlated positively with DKI Jakarta and Indonesia; subsequently, it has the potential to serve as an early warning for an anticipated wave. Despite the coverage of vaccines, AJCUI and DKI Jakarta positivity rates are shifting due to evolving virus variants. Altogether, the comprehensively recorded data would enable an understanding of COVID-19 dynamics, serve as a model for unprecedented disaster and public health management in general.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention. This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi. The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified. With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period. This study shows how the consistency of a privately run IRS campaign can improve the health of employees. More research is needed on the duration and timing of IRS programmes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections. Overall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda. Distribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionInformed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India.

MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings.

ResultsA total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non-students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48%-25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67%-26.14%) and non-student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% - 31.43%).

ConclusionA significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent. These results are of paramount importance for future policies as well as for posterity.</p>
