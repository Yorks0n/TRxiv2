Vaccines may have non-specific effects which are not assessed within the current regulatory framework. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs -- overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs were similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (3.03 (1.29-7.09) [0.6% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted. Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections. MeaningDespite the low risk of adverse events, the results suggest that mRNA vaccines increase the risk of severe adverse events. However, given the low risk of COVID-19 infection in children, this is relevant to consider. The results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.\nTrends in long-term vaping among adults in England, 2013-2023\nAuthors: Jackson, S. E.; Tattan-Birch, H.; Shahab, L.; Brown, J.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300376\nObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping among adults in England. DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey. SettingEngland. Participants179,725 adults ([\u0026ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023. Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod). ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively). ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults. What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people. C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use. C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping. C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day. C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

D.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39). ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.\nThe remarkable ups and downs of birth rate in Switzerland 2020 to 2023 in a historical context\nAuthors: Le Vu, M.; Matthes, K. L.; Staub, K.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299432\nWe follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among \u003e30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.\nAssessing the effectiveness of near real-time flow cytometry in monitoring ozone disinfection in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant\nAuthors: Dowdell, K. S.; Olsen, K.; Martinez Paz, E. F.; Sun, A.; Keown, J.; Lahr, R.; Steglitz, B.; Busch, A.; LiPuma, J. J.; Olson, T.; Raskin, L.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300640\nWhile real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendalls tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendalls tau=0.40, p\u003c0.01), HPC (Kendalls tau=0.20, p\u003c0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendalls tau=0.30, p\u003c0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p\u003c0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.

J.; Malloum, K. B.; Cantalino, J.; Signor, C.; Leclerc, P.; Bergeron, G.; Mercure, S.-A.; Cadieux, G.\nScore: 154.3, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300022\nBackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [\u0026ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.\nEnsemble Learning: Predicting Human Pathogenicity of Hematophagous Arthropod Vector-Borne Viruses\nAuthors: Hu, H.; Zhao, C.; Jin, M.; Chen, J.; Liu, X.; Guo, J.; Shi, H.; Wang, C.; Chen, Y.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300660\nHematophagous arthropods occupy a pivotal role in ecosystems, serving as vectors for a wide array of pathogens with significant implications for public health. Their capacity to harbor and transmit viruses through biting actions creates a substantial risk of zoonotic spillover. Despite the advancements in metagenomic approaches for virus discovery in vectors, the isolation and cultivation of viruses still pose significant challenges, thereby limiting comprehensive assessments of their pathogenicity. Here, we curated two datasets: one with 294 viruses, characterized by 37 epidemiological features, encompassing virus information and host associations; the second with 71,622 sequences of hematophagous arthropod vector-borne viruses, annotated with 33 sequence features. Two XGBoost models were developed to predict arbovirus human pathogenicity--one integrating macroscopic eco-epidemiological data, the other incorporating virus-related sequence features. The macroscopic model identified non-vector host transmission as a key determinant, especially involving Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora Order. The sequence-based model demonstrated that viral adhesion and viral invasion had distinct trends with consistent increase and decrease in the likelihood of virus pathogenicity to humans, respectively. With validated through an independent dataset, the model exhibited a congruous alignment with documented pathogenicity outcomes. Together, the models offer a holistic framework for assessing the pathogenic potential of viruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods.\nPredictors of Breast Self-Examination Practice Among Women Aged 20 and Above In Sidama Region, Southern Ethiopia. Health Belief Model Approach.\nAuthors: Geleta, D.; Bekele, B.; Yunkura, E.; Bogale, N.; Gemechu, L.; Gebretsadik, A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300590\nIntroductionBreast self-examination is a straightforward, affordable, and uncomplicated approach to identify any alteration in the breast. When conducted correctly, it aids in the early detection of breast cancer and diminishes its impact on health and mortality. It is advised that women aged 20 and above perform self-examinations monthly, consistently. However, the extent of breast self-examination practices in Ethiopia has not been thoroughly documented. ObjectiveThe aim of the study is to identify predictors of breast self-examination practices and associated factors among women aged 20 and above in Sidama Region, South Ethiopia. MethodsA Cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 women aged 20-70 years. The study employed a multistage sampling method. Data collection was performed using a structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population in relation to relevant variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. Variables with p-value \u003c0.25 were considered as candidates for multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was declared at P \u003c 0.05 and 95% CI. ResultThe prevalence of breast self-examination was found to be 5.2%, with only 46.2% of participants performing it regularly. Factors significantly associated with the practice of BSE among women included were Good knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination (Adjusted odds ratio=4.5, 95%CI: 1.4, 14.7), high perceived susceptibility (Adjusted odds Ratio =2.7, 95%CI: 1.4, 5.2), high perceived barrier (Adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95%CI: 0.11, 0.8) and high perceived self-efficacy (Adjusted odds ratio=3.9, 95%CI: 2.0, 7.7). ConclusionThe study revealed a notably low prevalence of BSE practice among the study population compared to previous study conducted in Ethiopia. Factors such as knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination, high perceived susceptibility, and high perceived self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of BSE practice. To address this issue, collaboration and efforts from various stakeholders including Zonal Health department, District health offices, Health workers, and other relevant parties are needed. It is crucial to focus on raising awareness and improving the perception of women regarding BSE to enhance the currently inadequate practice.\nRetrospective analysis of Covid-19 hospitalization modelling scenarios which guided policy response in France\nAuthors: Langevin, M.; Starck, T.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300086\nEpidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

A.; Gebremedhin, T.; Jihad, M. M.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300668\nBackgroundCommunity-based health insurance (CBHI) has emerged with exciting ideas in accessing reliable health care services for low and middle-income countries. Despite increasing effort, empirical evidence shows enrolment has remained low in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed identifies determinants of enrollment into CBHI in Southwest Ethiopia. MethodsCommunity based unmatched case-control study was conducted in Chora district, Bunno Beddele Zone Southwest Ethiopia from 17th May-14th June 2021. About 245 cases and 245 controls (1: 1 ratio) were selected by simple random sampling technique, and participated in the study. Data were collected using face-to-face interview techniques with pre-tested questionnaire, and entered to Epi-data 4.6, then exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors associated with enrolment into CBHI. The strength of association was measured using odds ratio. The findings were presented along with their corresponding 95%CI. Variables with p-values \u003c0.05 were considered as determinants of CBHI enrolment. ResultsThe study revealed that female-headed households [AOR:10.86, 95%CI: 3.005-39.16], age of household head, being 35-50 years old [AOR:3.81, 95%CI:1.61-9.02], and being above50 years [AOR: 3.59, 95%CI: 1.23-10.47], having 4-5 family sizes [AOR:7.3, 95%CI: 2.08-25.84] and [\u0026ge;]6 family sizes [AOR:13.31, 95%CI: 3.86-45.92], distance from health facility of [\u0026le;]30 minutes [AOR:8.35, 95%CI: 3.22-21.65], favorable perception toward providers technical competencies [AOR:7.62, 95%CI:2.2-26.4], fully trusted on CBHI scheme [AOR:10.82, 95%CI:2.37-45.17] and moderate trust towards CBHI scheme managements [AOR:4.91, 95%CI:1.9-12.65] and positive attitudes towards CBHI scheme [AOR:4.34, 95%CI: 1.525, 12.32] were determinants among households for CBHI enrollment. ConclusionAvailability of contractual health-facility at nearest distances, being households head aged above 35years, being female-headship, large family-size, favorable perception towards health care providers technical competencies, trust towards scheme management, and positive attitudes toward scheme were determined CBHI scheme enrollment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects which are not assessed within the current regulatory framework.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs -- overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs were similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (3.03 (1.29-7.09) [0.6% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.

Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections.

MeaningDespite the low risk of adverse events, the results suggest that mRNA vaccines increase the risk of severe adverse events. However, given the low risk of COVID-19 infection in children, this is relevant to consider. The results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping among adults in England.

DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey.

SettingEngland.

Participants179,725 adults ([&amp;ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023.

Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod).

ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively).

ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults.

What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people.
C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use.
C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping.
C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day.
C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39).

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among &gt;30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendalls tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendalls tau=0.40, p&lt;0.01), HPC (Kendalls tau=0.20, p&lt;0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendalls tau=0.30, p&lt;0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p&lt;0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization.

MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [&amp;ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress.

ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6).

InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematophagous arthropods occupy a pivotal role in ecosystems, serving as vectors for a wide array of pathogens with significant implications for public health. Their capacity to harbor and transmit viruses through biting actions creates a substantial risk of zoonotic spillover. Despite the advancements in metagenomic approaches for virus discovery in vectors, the isolation and cultivation of viruses still pose significant challenges, thereby limiting comprehensive assessments of their pathogenicity. Here, we curated two datasets: one with 294 viruses, characterized by 37 epidemiological features, encompassing virus information and host associations; the second with 71,622 sequences of hematophagous arthropod vector-borne viruses, annotated with 33 sequence features. Two XGBoost models were developed to predict arbovirus human pathogenicity--one integrating macroscopic eco-epidemiological data, the other incorporating virus-related sequence features. The macroscopic model identified non-vector host transmission as a key determinant, especially involving Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora Order. The sequence-based model demonstrated that viral adhesion and viral invasion had distinct trends with consistent increase and decrease in the likelihood of virus pathogenicity to humans, respectively. With validated through an independent dataset, the model exhibited a congruous alignment with documented pathogenicity outcomes. Together, the models offer a holistic framework for assessing the pathogenic potential of viruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionBreast self-examination is a straightforward, affordable, and uncomplicated approach to identify any alteration in the breast. When conducted correctly, it aids in the early detection of breast cancer and diminishes its impact on health and mortality. It is advised that women aged 20 and above perform self-examinations monthly, consistently. However, the extent of breast self-examination practices in Ethiopia has not been thoroughly documented.

ObjectiveThe aim of the study is to identify predictors of breast self-examination practices and associated factors among women aged 20 and above in Sidama Region, South Ethiopia.

MethodsA Cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 women aged 20-70 years. The study employed a multistage sampling method. Data collection was performed using a structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population in relation to relevant variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. Variables with p-value &lt;0.25 were considered as candidates for multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was declared at P &lt; 0.05 and 95% CI.

ResultThe prevalence of breast self-examination was found to be 5.2%, with only 46.2% of participants performing it regularly. Factors significantly associated with the practice of BSE among women included were Good knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination (Adjusted odds ratio=4.5, 95%CI: 1.4, 14.7), high perceived susceptibility (Adjusted odds Ratio =2.7, 95%CI: 1.4, 5.2), high perceived barrier (Adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95%CI: 0.11, 0.8) and high perceived self-efficacy (Adjusted odds ratio=3.9, 95%CI: 2.0, 7.7).

ConclusionThe study revealed a notably low prevalence of BSE practice among the study population compared to previous study conducted in Ethiopia. Factors such as knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination, high perceived susceptibility, and high perceived self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of BSE practice. To address this issue, collaboration and efforts from various stakeholders including Zonal Health department, District health offices, Health workers, and other relevant parties are needed. It is crucial to focus on raising awareness and improving the perception of women regarding BSE to enhance the currently inadequate practice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCommunity-based health insurance (CBHI) has emerged with exciting ideas in accessing reliable health care services for low and middle-income countries. Despite increasing effort, empirical evidence shows enrolment has remained low in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed identifies determinants of enrollment into CBHI in Southwest Ethiopia.

MethodsCommunity based unmatched case-control study was conducted in Chora district, Bunno Beddele Zone Southwest Ethiopia from 17th May-14th June 2021. About 245 cases and 245 controls (1: 1 ratio) were selected by simple random sampling technique, and participated in the study. Data were collected using face-to-face interview techniques with pre-tested questionnaire, and entered to Epi-data 4.6, then exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors associated with enrolment into CBHI. The strength of association was measured using odds ratio. The findings were presented along with their corresponding 95%CI. Variables with p-values &lt;0.05 were considered as determinants of CBHI enrolment.

ResultsThe study revealed that female-headed households [AOR:10.86, 95%CI: 3.005-39.16], age of household head, being 35-50 years old [AOR:3.81, 95%CI:1.61-9.02], and being above50 years [AOR: 3.59, 95%CI: 1.23-10.47], having 4-5 family sizes [AOR:7.3, 95%CI: 2.08-25.84] and [&amp;ge;]6 family sizes [AOR:13.31, 95%CI: 3.86-45.92], distance from health facility of [&amp;le;]30 minutes [AOR:8.35, 95%CI: 3.22-21.65], favorable perception toward providers technical competencies [AOR:7.62, 95%CI:2.2-26.4], fully trusted on CBHI scheme [AOR:10.82, 95%CI:2.37-45.17] and moderate trust towards CBHI scheme managements [AOR:4.91, 95%CI:1.9-12.65] and positive attitudes towards CBHI scheme [AOR:4.34, 95%CI: 1.525, 12.32] were determinants among households for CBHI enrollment.

ConclusionAvailability of contractual health-facility at nearest distances, being households head aged above 35years, being female-headship, large family-size, favorable perception towards health care providers technical competencies, trust towards scheme management, and positive attitudes toward scheme were determined CBHI scheme enrollment.</p>
