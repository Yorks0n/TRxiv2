R.; Neale, B.; Hveem, K.; Mägi, R.; Palotie, A.; Heyne, H.; Mars, N.; Ganna, A.; Ripatti, S.\nScore: 34.0, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291186\nPolygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.\nAssociation between post-infection COVID-19 vaccination and symptom severity of post COVID-19 condition among patients on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands: a retrospective cohort study\nAuthors: Berry, D.; Dalhuisen, T.; Marchena, G.; Tiemessen, I.; Geubbels, E.; Jaspers, L.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291649\nObjectivesIn this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate symptom severity change following COVID-19 vaccination among post COVID-19 condition (PCC) patients on Bonaire. MethodsSymptomatic cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between the start of the pandemic and 1 October 2021, were unrecovered on the interview day and unvaccinated prior to infection were identified from the national case registry. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 15 November and 4 December 2021 about sociodemographic factors, pre-pandemic health, COVID-19 symptoms and vaccination status. We compared symptom severity change between the acute and post-acute disease phase (\u003e4 weeks after disease onset) of 14 symptoms on a five-point Likert scale for 36 PCC patients having received at least one dose of the BNT162 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine and 11 patients who remained unvaccinated, using separate multiple linear regression models. ResultsMost common post-acute symptoms included fatigue (81%), reduced physical endurance (79%), and reduced muscle strength (64%). Post-infection vaccination was significantly associated with reduced severity of heart palpitations, after adjusting for acute phase severity and duration of illness ({beta} 0.60, 95% CI 0.18-1.02). We did not find a statistically significant association with symptom severity change for other, more prevalent symptoms. ConclusionsLarger prospective studies are needed to confirm our observation in a small study population that post-infection COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced severity of heart palpitations among those with this symptom self-attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAssociation of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States, 2022-2023\nAuthors: Packard, S. E.; Susser, E.\nScore: 121.3, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290930\nObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States. MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms \u003e 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.\nTracking SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in rural communities using blood-fed mosquitoes\nAuthors: Krajacich, B. J.; Samake, D.; Dao, A.; Diallo, M.; Sanogo, Z. L.; Yaro, A. S.; Ziguime, A.; Poudiougo, J.; Cisse, K.; Traore, M.; dit Assitoun, A.; Faiman, R.; Zaidi, I.; Woodford, J.; Duffy, P. E.; Lehmann, T.\nScore: 79.6, Published: 2023-06-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.23291267\nThe spread of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be well monitored and understood in areas without capacity for effective disease surveillance. Countries with a young population will have disproportionately large numbers of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infections, further hindering detection of infection in the population. Sero-surveillance on a country-wide scale by trained medical professionals may be limited in scope in resource limited setting such as Mali. Novel ways of broadly sampling the human population in a non-invasive method would allow for large-scale surveillance at a reduced cost. Here we evaluate the collection of naturally bloodfed mosquitoes to test for human anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the laboratory and at five field locations in Mali. Immunoglobulin-G antibodies were found to be readily detectable within the mosquito bloodmeals by a bead-based immunoassay at least through 10 hours post-feeding with high sensitivity (0.900 {+/-} 0.059) and specificity (0.924 {+/-} 0.080), respectively, indicating that most blood-fed mosquitoes collected indoors during early morning hours (and thus, have likely fed the previous night) are viable samples for analysis. We find that reactivity to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens rose during the pandemic from pre-pandemic levels. Consistent with other sero-surveillance studies in Mali, crude seropositivity of blood sampled via mosquitoes was 6.3% in October/November 2020 over all sites, and increased to 25.1% overall, with the town closest to Bamako reaching 46.7% in February of 2021. Mosquito bloodmeals a viable target for conventional immunoassays, and therefore country-wide sero-surveillance of human diseases (both vector-borne and non-vector-borne) is attainable in areas where human-biting mosquitoes are common, and is an informative, cost-effective, non-invasive sampling option.\nA review of scientific theories used to justify the delivery of school-based mindfulness programmes . A protocol for a scoping review\nAuthors: Abbott, P. A.; Nixon, G.; Stanley, I.; D'Ambruoso, L.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291616\nBackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing. MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team. DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.\nCovid-19 Excess Mortality in China: A Regional Comparison\nAuthors: LIU, L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291443\nEstimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but lower than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.\nThe prevalence of post COVID-19 condition (PCC) and a simple risk scoring tool for PCC screening on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands: a retrospective cohort study.\nAuthors: Berry, D.; Dalhuisen, T.; Marchena, G.; Tiemessen, I.; Geubbels, E.; Jaspers, L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291646\nAimTo assess the prevalence of post COVID-19 condition (PCC) on Bonaire and develop a practical risk scoring tool for PCC screening, using easily obtainable characteristics. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases were randomly sampled from Bonaires case-registry and telephone interviewed between 15-November-2021 and 4-December-2021. PCC patients had a PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1-March-2020 and 1-October-2021) and self-attributed at least one symptom lasting over four weeks to their infection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to derive a risk formula to develop a practical risk scoring tool. ResultsOut of 414 cases, 160 (39%) were PCC patients. Fifty-three patients were unrecovered (median illness duration 250 days (IQR 34)). Of recovered patients, 35% experienced symptoms for at least 3 months after disease onset. PCC prevalence was highest among females (38%), 40-59 year-olds (40%), morbidly obese (31%) and hospitalized patients (80%). A PCC risk scoring tool using age, sex, presence of comorbidities, and acute phase hospitalization or GP visit had an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95%CI 0.63-0.74). Adding smoking, alcohol use, BMI, education level, and number of acute phase symptoms increased the AUC to 0.79 (95%CI 0.74-0.83). Subgroup analyses of non-hospitalized patients (n=362) resulted in similar AUCs. ConclusionThee estimated prevalence of PCC on Bonaire was 39%. Moreover, easily obtainable patient characteristics can be used to build a risk scoring tool for PCC with acceptable discriminatory power. After external validation, this tool could aid the development of healthcare interventions in low resource settings to identify patients at risk for PCC. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAn increasing number of studies show that varying proportions of COVID-19 patients are left with prolonged health issues, including persistence of symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of muscle strength, and concentration issues following the acute phase of COVID-19. C_LIO_LIPrevalence of this recently recognized medical syndrome, long-COVID or post COVID-19 condition (PCC), ranges between 37-49% in the European Netherlands, though there are no reports of PCC prevalence in the Caribbean Netherlands to date. C_LI What this study addsO_LIWe designed the first retrospective cohort study estimating the prevalence and characteristics of PCC on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands and devised a simple risk scoring formula to calculate PCC risk. C_LIO_LIWe found a PCC prevalence of 39% on Bonaire and describe a proof-of-concept risk scoring tool with good discriminatory performance. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policyO_LIOur study estimates PCC prevalence and describes disease and patient characteristics for Bonaire. This is the first study providing these insights in the Caribbean; a region that has been underrepresented in PCC research. C_LIO_LIFurthermore, our study highlights the added benefit of registering sufficient patient characteristics at the time of consultation for acute COVID-19 disease, for improved PCC screening later on. C_LIO_LIAfter external validation of our proof-of-concept study, this risk scoring tool could aid the development of primary care and public health interventions and health communication strategies in low resource settings for the identification of patients at risk for PCC.

H.; Anderson, L.; Ness, H.; Smith, T. R.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.23291485\nNational opinion on a wide variety of public health topics can change over time or have highly contextual nuisances. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we aimed to see how public perceptions have changed regarding the acceptance of using wastewater for community health monitoring in the metropolitan United States. This study is an annual update of prior inquiry into knowledge of wastewater-based epidemiology, privacy concerns surrounding the collection of wastewater samples and the use of data acquired along with privacy awareness from an online survey administered in the winter of 2023. We found public support for monitoring of toxins (90.8%), disease (90.6%), terror (86.8%), illicit drugs (70.5%), prescription medications (68.6%), and gun residue (59.8%) remained high. Most respondents supported monitoring of the entire city (77.6%). This longitudinal research has shown year-upon-year only slight increases in public support of wastewater monitoring for public health protection and continues to show an absence of significant nationwide privacy concerns as long as catchment population sizes ensure fully anonymous households. This support is conditional and is probably best understood through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic where the value proposition of public protection was popularized. The survey also consistently showed the public would support expansion of wastewater monitoring as a standard complement of public health tools into other areas of public health protection.\nExclusive heat-not-burn cigarette smoking alters the profile of circulating microRNAs\nAuthors: Picchio, V.; Ferrero, G.; Cozzolino, C.; Pardini, B.; Floris, E.; Tarallo, S.; Dhori, X.; Nocella, C.; Loffredo, L.; Biondi-Zoccai, G.; Carnevale, R.; Frati, G.; Chimenti, I.; Pagano, F.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.23291325\nBackgroundTraditional combustion cigarette (TCC) smoking is an established risk factor for several types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) represent key molecules mediating pathogenetic mechanisms, and potential biomarkers for personalized risk assessment. TCC smoking globally changes the profile of circulating miRNAs. The use of heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBCs) as alternative smoking devices is rising exponentially worldwide, and the circulating miRNA profiles in chronic HNBC smokers are unknown. We aimed at defining the circulating miRNA profile of chronic exclusive HNBC smokers, and identifying potentially pathogenetic signatures. MethodsSerum samples were obtained from 60 healthy young subjects, stratified in chronic HNBC smokers, TCC smokers, and Non Smokers (20 subjects each). Three pooled samples per group were used for small RNA sequencing, and the fourth sub-group constituted the validation set. FindingsDifferential expression analysis revealed 108 differentially expressed miRNAs; 72 exclusively in TCC, 10 exclusively in HNBC, and 26 in both smoker groups. KEGG pathway analysis on target genes of the commonly modulated miRNAs returned cancer and cardiovascular disease associated pathways. Stringent abundance and fold-change criteria nailed down our functional bioinformatic analyses to a network where miR-25-3p and miR-221-3p are main hubs. InterpretationOur results define for the first time the miRNA profile in the serum of exclusive chronic HNBC smokers and suggest a significant impact of HNBCs on circulating miRNAs.

However, it is easier for autocratic leaders to fabricate data because they are not subject to scrutiny from media, opposition parties, and civil society. This suggests that autocratic governments are more likely to manipulate policy-relevant statistics than democratic governments. It is inherently difficult to test that claim because researchers typically do not have access to data from sources other than the government. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between regime type and data manipulation because of its widespread impact, as well as the ability to compare reported with excess deaths and test for statistical anomalies in reported data. Based on regressions for undercounting and statistical irregularities that take into account unintentional mismeasurement, I find that autocratic governments are more likely to deliberately under-report the impact of COVID-19 than their democratic counterparts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesIn this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate symptom severity change following COVID-19 vaccination among post COVID-19 condition (PCC) patients on Bonaire.

MethodsSymptomatic cases who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between the start of the pandemic and 1 October 2021, were unrecovered on the interview day and unvaccinated prior to infection were identified from the national case registry. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 15 November and 4 December 2021 about sociodemographic factors, pre-pandemic health, COVID-19 symptoms and vaccination status. We compared symptom severity change between the acute and post-acute disease phase (&gt;4 weeks after disease onset) of 14 symptoms on a five-point Likert scale for 36 PCC patients having received at least one dose of the BNT162 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine and 11 patients who remained unvaccinated, using separate multiple linear regression models.

ResultsMost common post-acute symptoms included fatigue (81%), reduced physical endurance (79%), and reduced muscle strength (64%). Post-infection vaccination was significantly associated with reduced severity of heart palpitations, after adjusting for acute phase severity and duration of illness ({beta} 0.60, 95% CI 0.18-1.02). We did not find a statistically significant association with symptom severity change for other, more prevalent symptoms.

ConclusionsLarger prospective studies are needed to confirm our observation in a small study population that post-infection COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced severity of heart palpitations among those with this symptom self-attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States.

MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms &gt; 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The spread of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be well monitored and understood in areas without capacity for effective disease surveillance. Countries with a young population will have disproportionately large numbers of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infections, further hindering detection of infection in the population. Sero-surveillance on a country-wide scale by trained medical professionals may be limited in scope in resource limited setting such as Mali. Novel ways of broadly sampling the human population in a non-invasive method would allow for large-scale surveillance at a reduced cost. Here we evaluate the collection of naturally bloodfed mosquitoes to test for human anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the laboratory and at five field locations in Mali. Immunoglobulin-G antibodies were found to be readily detectable within the mosquito bloodmeals by a bead-based immunoassay at least through 10 hours post-feeding with high sensitivity (0.900 {&#43;/-} 0.059) and specificity (0.924 {&#43;/-} 0.080), respectively, indicating that most blood-fed mosquitoes collected indoors during early morning hours (and thus, have likely fed the previous night) are viable samples for analysis. We find that reactivity to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens rose during the pandemic from pre-pandemic levels. Consistent with other sero-surveillance studies in Mali, crude seropositivity of blood sampled via mosquitoes was 6.3% in October/November 2020 over all sites, and increased to 25.1% overall, with the town closest to Bamako reaching 46.7% in February of 2021. Mosquito bloodmeals a viable target for conventional immunoassays, and therefore country-wide sero-surveillance of human diseases (both vector-borne and non-vector-borne) is attainable in areas where human-biting mosquitoes are common, and is an informative, cost-effective, non-invasive sampling option.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing.

MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team.

DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but lower than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimTo assess the prevalence of post COVID-19 condition (PCC) on Bonaire and develop a practical risk scoring tool for PCC screening, using easily obtainable characteristics.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases were randomly sampled from Bonaires case-registry and telephone interviewed between 15-November-2021 and 4-December-2021. PCC patients had a PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1-March-2020 and 1-October-2021) and self-attributed at least one symptom lasting over four weeks to their infection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to derive a risk formula to develop a practical risk scoring tool.

ResultsOut of 414 cases, 160 (39%) were PCC patients. Fifty-three patients were unrecovered (median illness duration 250 days (IQR 34)). Of recovered patients, 35% experienced symptoms for at least 3 months after disease onset. PCC prevalence was highest among females (38%), 40-59 year-olds (40%), morbidly obese (31%) and hospitalized patients (80%). A PCC risk scoring tool using age, sex, presence of comorbidities, and acute phase hospitalization or GP visit had an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95%CI 0.63-0.74). Adding smoking, alcohol use, BMI, education level, and number of acute phase symptoms increased the AUC to 0.79 (95%CI 0.74-0.83). Subgroup analyses of non-hospitalized patients (n=362) resulted in similar AUCs.

ConclusionThee estimated prevalence of PCC on Bonaire was 39%. Moreover, easily obtainable patient characteristics can be used to build a risk scoring tool for PCC with acceptable discriminatory power. After external validation, this tool could aid the development of healthcare interventions in low resource settings to identify patients at risk for PCC.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAn increasing number of studies show that varying proportions of COVID-19 patients are left with prolonged health issues, including persistence of symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of muscle strength, and concentration issues following the acute phase of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIPrevalence of this recently recognized medical syndrome,  long-COVID or  post COVID-19 condition (PCC), ranges between 37-49% in the European Netherlands, though there are no reports of PCC prevalence in the Caribbean Netherlands to date.

What this study addsO_LIWe designed the first retrospective cohort study estimating the prevalence and characteristics of PCC on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands and devised a simple risk scoring formula to calculate PCC risk.
C_LIO_LIWe found a PCC prevalence of 39% on Bonaire and describe a proof-of-concept risk scoring tool with good discriminatory performance.
C_LI

How this study might affect research, practice or policyO_LIOur study estimates PCC prevalence and describes disease and patient characteristics for Bonaire. This is the first study providing these insights in the Caribbean; a region that has been underrepresented in PCC research.
C_LIO_LIFurthermore, our study highlights the added benefit of registering sufficient patient characteristics at the time of consultation for acute COVID-19 disease, for improved PCC screening later on.
C_LIO_LIAfter external validation of our proof-of-concept study, this risk scoring tool could aid the development of primary care and public health interventions and health communication strategies in low resource settings for the identification of patients at risk for PCC.

        <p class="abstract">National opinion on a wide variety of public health topics can change over time or have highly contextual nuisances. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we aimed to see how public perceptions have changed regarding the acceptance of using wastewater for community health monitoring in the metropolitan United States. This study is an annual update of prior inquiry into knowledge of wastewater-based epidemiology, privacy concerns surrounding the collection of wastewater samples and the use of data acquired along with privacy awareness from an online survey administered in the winter of 2023. We found public support for monitoring of toxins (90.8%), disease (90.6%), terror (86.8%), illicit drugs (70.5%), prescription medications (68.6%), and gun residue (59.8%) remained high. Most respondents supported monitoring of the entire city (77.6%). This longitudinal research has shown year-upon-year only slight increases in public support of wastewater monitoring for public health protection and continues to show an absence of significant nationwide privacy concerns as long as catchment population sizes ensure fully anonymous households. This support is conditional and is probably best understood through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic where the value proposition of public protection was popularized. The survey also consistently showed the public would support expansion of wastewater monitoring as a standard complement of public health tools into other areas of public health protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTraditional combustion cigarette (TCC) smoking is an established risk factor for several types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) represent key molecules mediating pathogenetic mechanisms, and potential biomarkers for personalized risk assessment. TCC smoking globally changes the profile of circulating miRNAs. The use of heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBCs) as alternative smoking devices is rising exponentially worldwide, and the circulating miRNA profiles in chronic HNBC smokers are unknown.

We aimed at defining the circulating miRNA profile of chronic exclusive HNBC smokers, and identifying potentially pathogenetic signatures.

MethodsSerum samples were obtained from 60 healthy young subjects, stratified in chronic HNBC smokers, TCC smokers, and Non Smokers (20 subjects each). Three pooled samples per group were used for small RNA sequencing, and the fourth sub-group constituted the validation set.

FindingsDifferential expression analysis revealed 108 differentially expressed miRNAs; 72 exclusively in TCC, 10 exclusively in HNBC, and 26 in both smoker groups. KEGG pathway analysis on target genes of the commonly modulated miRNAs returned cancer and cardiovascular disease associated pathways. Stringent abundance and fold-change criteria nailed down our functional bioinformatic analyses to a network where miR-25-3p and miR-221-3p are main hubs.

InterpretationOur results define for the first time the miRNA profile in the serum of exclusive chronic HNBC smokers and suggest a significant impact of HNBCs on circulating miRNAs.

        <p class="abstract">Autocratic and democratic leaders have an incentive to misreport data that may reveal policy failure. However, it is easier for autocratic leaders to fabricate data because they are not subject to scrutiny from media, opposition parties, and civil society. This suggests that autocratic governments are more likely to manipulate policy-relevant statistics than democratic governments. It is inherently difficult to test that claim because researchers typically do not have access to data from sources other than the government. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between regime type and data manipulation because of its widespread impact, as well as the ability to compare reported with excess deaths and test for statistical anomalies in reported data. Based on regressions for undercounting and statistical irregularities that take into account unintentional mismeasurement, I find that autocratic governments are more likely to deliberately under-report the impact of COVID-19 than their democratic counterparts.</p>
