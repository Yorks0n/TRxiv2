  "articleBody": " Mapping geographic and demographic shifts in container breeding mosquito-borne disease transmission suitability in Central and South America in a warming world\nAuthors: Ryan, S. J.; Lippi, C. A.; Stewart-Ibarra, A. M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296495\nThe recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) report brought into sharp relief the potential health impacts of a changing climate across large geographic regions. It also highlighted the gaps in available evidence to support detailed quantitative assessments of health impacts for many regions. In an increasingly urbanizing world, there is a need for additional information about the risk of mosquito-borne diseases from vectors adapted to human water storage behavior. Specifically, a better understanding of the geographic distribution of disease risk under different scenarios of climate warming and human populations shifts. For the Central and South America chapter of the IPCC Working Group II report, regional extractions of published projections of dengue and Zika risk in a changing climate were generated by one of the authors of this study. In that process, the lack of a compendium of available published risk estimates became apparent. This paper responds to that need and extends the scope of the IPCC report results for Central and South America. We present novel geospatial descriptions of risk for transmission for five mosquito-borne disease systems under future projected climate and demographic scenarios, including the potential risk for malaria in the event of the introduction and establishment of a vector of high global concern, Anopheles stephensi. We then present country-level and IPCC geospatial sub-region risk descriptions under baseline and future projected scenarios. By including demographic projections using the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, we capture potential future risk in a way that is transparent and straightforward to compare and replicate. The goal of this paper is to report on these model output data and their availability. From a sub-regional perspective, the largest proportional gains in risk will be seen in the Southwestern South America (SWS) sub-region, comprising much of the southwestern coastline, for which suitability for Aedes aegypti transmitted dengue and Zika risk will see massive increases with warming, putting a large number of people at risk under future scenarios. In contrast, at the country level, the largest projected population risk impacts will be seen in Brazil for both arboviral and potential introduced malaria risk, despite some risks projected to decrease as parts of the country are too hot to sustain transmission risk. This paper provides modeled outputs for future use, in addition to broad summary descriptions at regional and country levels.\nA mixed method study to assess behavioral and social predictors of parent/caregivers intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 disease in an Indian state marked by significant health disparities.\nAuthors: Singh, T.; Kumar, S.; Sinha, S.; Singh, V.\nScore: 4.4, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296592\nBackgroundParents/caregivers are the key decision-makers for childs health care including vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy along with lagging full immunization coverage for childhood vaccination in India, affect child health outcome and will affect covid-19 vaccine uptake in children. It is important to understand behavioral and social factors surrounding childhood COVID-19 vaccination to design appropriate interventions to improve uptake. MethodsA mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative method was undertaken. A cross sectional survey of parents/caregivers of children aged less than 18 years residing in the state was carried out to find the prevalence and predictors of parent/ caregivers intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 disease. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to find facilitating and barrier factors for childhood COVID-19 vaccination. ResultOut of 9904 study participants, 73.4% had intention to vaccinate. Parent/caregivers education and occupation, marital status, family type, family income, co-morbidity and previous COVID-19 infection in family, childhood vaccination under NIS, were found to be significantly associated. The likelihood of intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 disease was greater among parents/caregivers aged 18-29 years (OR=2.631, 95% CI [1.733- 3.995], illiterate parents/caregivers (OR=3.037, 95% CI [2.319-3.977], prior COVID-19 infection in family (OR=1.595, 95% CI [1.432-1.821], and childrens prior vaccinations under NIS (OR=1.251, 95% CI [1.218-1.289]. In qualitative part, forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. The majority of intending parents gave vaccine effectiveness, increased immunity, high infection risk, herd immunity, and medical recommendations as reasons. Parents who refused mentioned inadequate data, adverse effects, beliefs, safety, and inconvenience as reasons. Effectiveness, and safety, long-term effects, and the short testing period were among the concerns of hesitant parents. ConclusionIn order to promote COVID-19 vaccination among children, we need to address barriers, facilitators and behavioral determinants of parents/caregivers identified in this study and have targeted strategies for them.\nAssessing health equity in wastewater monitoring programs: Differences in the demographics and social vulnerability of sewered and unsewered populations across North Carolina\nAuthors: Hu, X. C.; Reckling, S. K.; Keshaviah, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296680\nBackground: Wastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied. Objectives: We conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county. Methods: After intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system, regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring, with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than +/- 5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error). Results: As a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents. Discussion: Our results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.\nSoil surveillance for monitoring soil-transmitted helminth infections: method development and field testing in three countries\nAuthors: Manuel, M.; Amato, H.; Pilotte, N.; Chieng, B.; Siko, J.; Harris, M.; Nadimpalli, M.; Janagaraj, V.; Houngbegnon, P.; Rajendiran, R.; Thamburaj, J.; Kaliappan, S. P.; Sirois, A. R.; Walch, G.; Oswald, W.; Asbjörnsdottir, K. H.; Galagan, S.; Walson, J. L.; Williams, S. A.; Luty, A. J. F.; Njenga, S.; Ibikounle, M.; Ajjampur, S. S. R.; Pickering, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296174\nOne-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting extensive laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in three countries: Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species (including Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and A. ceylanicum). Using matched household soil and stool samples, detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost of sample collection and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations. Synopsis: Limited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.\nPrevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military personnel during the second epidemic wave in Peru\nAuthors: Valladares-Garrido, D.; Dominguez-Troncos, H.; Picon-Reategui, C. K.; Valdiviezo-Morales, C.; Vera-Ponce, V. J.; Failoc-Rojas, V. E.; Pereira-Victorio, C. J.; Leon - Figueroa, D. A.; Valladares-Garrido, M. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296474\nThere is few research in military members that provided protection and security during the COVID-19 crisis. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military members. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 02 and 09, 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region of Lambayeque, Peru. The outcome was fear of COVID-19, measured with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The association with resilience (abbreviated CD-RISC), food insecurity (HFIAS), physical activity (IPAQ-S), eating disorder (EAT-26), and other socio-labor variables were assessed. Of 525 participants, the median age was 22, 95.8% were male, and 19.2% experienced fear of COVID-19. A higher prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was associated with age (PR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), religion (PP=2.05; 95% CI: 1.04-4.05), eating disorder (PR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.99-4.36), and having a relative with mental disorder (PR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.09-4.17). Overweight (PR=0.58; 95% IC: 0.37-0.90) and a high level of resilience (PR=0.63; 95% IC: 0.43-0.93) were associated with a lower prevalence of fear of COVID-19. Two out of ten military personnel were afraid of COVID-19. We recommend special attention to the factors associated with the development of suicide risk in military personnel.\nDrivers of inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia: A systematic review of qualitative literature\nAuthors: Murray, J. L.; Leung, D. T.; Hanson, O. R.; Ahmed, S. M.; Pavia, A. T.; Khan, A. I.; Szymczak, J. E.; Vaughn, V. M.; Patel, P. K.; Biswas, D.; Watt, M. H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296313\nAntimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires an understanding of the factors and context that contribute to inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The goal of this qualitative systematic review was to synthesize themes across levels of the social ecological framework that drive inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia. In September 2023, we conducted a systematic search using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase. Search terms, identified a priori, were related to research methods, topic, and geographic location. We identified 165 articles from the initial search and 8 upon reference review (n=173); after removing duplicates and preprints (n=12) and excluding those that did not meet eligibility criteria (n=115), 46 articles were included in the review. We assessed methodological quality using the qualitative Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. The studies represented 6 countries in South Asia, and included data from patients, health care providers, community members, and policy makers. For each manuscript, we wrote a summary memo to extract the factors that impede antimicrobial stewardship. We coded memos using NVivo software; codes were organized by levels of the social ecological framework. Barriers were identified at multiple levels including the patient (self-treatment with antimicrobials; perceived value of antimicrobials), the provider (antimicrobials as a universal therapy; gaps in knowledge and skills; financial or reputational incentives), the clinical setting (lack of resources; poor regulation of the facility), the community (access to formal health care; informal drug vendors; social norms), and policy (absence of a regulatory framework; poor implementation of existing policies). The findings highlight the importance of working across multiple sectors to design and implement approaches to antimicrobial stewardship in South Asia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) report brought into sharp relief the potential health impacts of a changing climate across large geographic regions. It also highlighted the gaps in available evidence to support detailed quantitative assessments of health impacts for many regions. In an increasingly urbanizing world, there is a need for additional information about the risk of mosquito-borne diseases from vectors adapted to human water storage behavior. Specifically, a better understanding of the geographic distribution of disease risk under different scenarios of climate warming and human populations shifts. For the Central and South America chapter of the IPCC Working Group II report, regional extractions of published projections of dengue and Zika risk in a changing climate were generated by one of the authors of this study. In that process, the lack of a compendium of available published risk estimates became apparent. This paper responds to that need and extends the scope of the IPCC report results for Central and South America. We present novel geospatial descriptions of risk for transmission for five mosquito-borne disease systems under future projected climate and demographic scenarios, including the potential risk for malaria in the event of the introduction and establishment of a vector of high global concern, Anopheles stephensi. We then present country-level and IPCC geospatial sub-region risk descriptions under baseline and future projected scenarios. By including demographic projections using the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, we capture potential future risk in a way that is transparent and straightforward to compare and replicate. The goal of this paper is to report on these model output data and their availability. From a sub-regional perspective, the largest proportional gains in risk will be seen in the Southwestern South America (SWS) sub-region, comprising much of the southwestern coastline, for which suitability for Aedes aegypti transmitted dengue and Zika risk will see massive increases with warming, putting a large number of people at risk under future scenarios. In contrast, at the country level, the largest projected population risk impacts will be seen in Brazil for both arboviral and potential introduced malaria risk, despite some risks projected to decrease as parts of the country are too hot to sustain transmission risk. This paper provides modeled outputs for future use, in addition to broad summary descriptions at regional and country levels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundParents/caregivers are the key decision-makers for childs health care including vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy along with lagging full immunization coverage for childhood vaccination in India, affect child health outcome and will affect covid-19 vaccine uptake in children. It is important to understand behavioral and social factors surrounding childhood COVID-19 vaccination to design appropriate interventions to improve uptake.

MethodsA mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative method was undertaken. A cross sectional survey of parents/caregivers of children aged less than 18 years residing in the state was carried out to find the prevalence and predictors of parent/ caregivers intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 disease. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to find facilitating and barrier factors for childhood COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultOut of 9904 study participants, 73.4% had intention to vaccinate. Parent/caregivers education and occupation, marital status, family type, family income, co-morbidity and previous COVID-19 infection in family, childhood vaccination under NIS, were found to be significantly associated. The likelihood of intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 disease was greater among parents/caregivers aged 18-29 years (OR=2.631, 95% CI [1.733- 3.995], illiterate parents/caregivers (OR=3.037, 95% CI [2.319-3.977], prior COVID-19 infection in family (OR=1.595, 95% CI [1.432-1.821], and childrens prior vaccinations under NIS (OR=1.251, 95% CI [1.218-1.289]. In qualitative part, forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. The majority of intending parents gave vaccine effectiveness, increased immunity, high infection risk, herd immunity, and medical recommendations as reasons. Parents who refused mentioned inadequate data, adverse effects, beliefs, safety, and inconvenience as reasons. Effectiveness, and safety, long-term effects, and the short testing period were among the concerns of hesitant parents.

ConclusionIn order to promote COVID-19 vaccination among children, we need to address barriers, facilitators and behavioral determinants of parents/caregivers identified in this study and have targeted strategies for them.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Wastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied. Objectives: We conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county. Methods: After intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system, regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring, with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than &#43;/- 5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error). Results: As a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents. Discussion: Our results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting extensive laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in three countries: Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species (including Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and A. ceylanicum). Using matched household soil and stool samples, detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost of sample collection and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations.

Synopsis: Limited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is few research in military members that provided protection and security during the COVID-19 crisis. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military members. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 02 and 09, 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region of Lambayeque, Peru. The outcome was fear of COVID-19, measured with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The association with resilience (abbreviated CD-RISC), food insecurity (HFIAS), physical activity (IPAQ-S), eating disorder (EAT-26), and other socio-labor variables were assessed. Of 525 participants, the median age was 22, 95.8% were male, and 19.2% experienced fear of COVID-19. A higher prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was associated with age (PR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), religion (PP=2.05; 95% CI: 1.04-4.05), eating disorder (PR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.99-4.36), and having a relative with mental disorder (PR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.09-4.17). Overweight (PR=0.58; 95% IC: 0.37-0.90) and a high level of resilience (PR=0.63; 95% IC: 0.43-0.93) were associated with a lower prevalence of fear of COVID-19. Two out of ten military personnel were afraid of COVID-19. We recommend special attention to the factors associated with the development of suicide risk in military personnel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires an understanding of the factors and context that contribute to inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The goal of this qualitative systematic review was to synthesize themes across levels of the social ecological framework that drive inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia. In September 2023, we conducted a systematic search using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase. Search terms, identified a priori, were related to research methods, topic, and geographic location. We identified 165 articles from the initial search and 8 upon reference review (n=173); after removing duplicates and preprints (n=12) and excluding those that did not meet eligibility criteria (n=115), 46 articles were included in the review. We assessed methodological quality using the qualitative Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. The studies represented 6 countries in South Asia, and included data from patients, health care providers, community members, and policy makers. For each manuscript, we wrote a summary memo to extract the factors that impede antimicrobial stewardship. We coded memos using NVivo software; codes were organized by levels of the social ecological framework. Barriers were identified at multiple levels including the patient (self-treatment with antimicrobials; perceived value of antimicrobials), the provider (antimicrobials as a universal therapy; gaps in knowledge and skills; financial or reputational incentives), the clinical setting (lack of resources; poor regulation of the facility), the community (access to formal health care; informal drug vendors; social norms), and policy (absence of a regulatory framework; poor implementation of existing policies). The findings highlight the importance of working across multiple sectors to design and implement approaches to antimicrobial stewardship in South Asia.</p>
