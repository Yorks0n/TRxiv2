Vaccines may have non-specific effects. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (\"SAEs\") and severe adverse events (\"Severe AEs\") as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.\nProcessed food intake assortativity in the personal networks of East European older adults\nAuthors: Hancean, M.-G.; Lerner, J.; Perc, M.; Molina, J. L.; Geanta, M.; Oana, I.; Pintoiu Mihaila, B. E.; Puncioiu, S. E.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301787\nCoalescing evidence shows that food habits circulate through social relationships. However, seniors' social networks and unhealthy dietary choices remain underexplored, particularly within rural Eastern Europe's unique socioeconomic and cultural contexts. We investigate how social networks affect the consumption of processed foods high in salt among community-dwelling older adults (64 years of age and older) from a Romanian rural community. We use an observational cross-sectional quantitative approach (a personal network research design) to collect self-reported information about the study participants (egos; n = 83), their social contacts (alters), and the relationships among them (ego-alter and alter-alter ties). We fit multi-level, mixed-effects models, clustering alters by their egos, and show that older adults eating processed food high in salt are more likely to be connected to alters with similar eating habits (assortativity). This result is of particular relevance when considering the nutritional health of older adults, as it implies that interventions targeting this demographic should extend beyond the individual to encompass their social environment. Despite the cross-sectional approach limitations, our work may enrich the understanding of dietary patterns among rural Eastern European seniors and provide an empirical foundation for designing targeted interventions that can mitigate health risks associated with high-salt diets in older populations.\nReduction in State Specific Influenza Mortality During the COVID Pandemic and Its Association with Political Preference\nAuthors: Morris, R. D.\nScore: 22.5, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39). ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.\nPooled evidence precision of clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment was stabilized eight months after the outbreak.\nAuthors: Ribeiro, T. B.; Ramirez, P. C.; de Melo, L. R. S.; Diaz-Quijano, F. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301572\nOBJECTIVEAt the beginning of 2020, hydroxychloroquine showed promising in vitro activity for Covid-19 and several studies were oriented to assess its safety and efficacy. However, after a few months, hydroxychloroquine has proved ineffective. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed quickly and in different settings represent the scientific communitys capacity to assess drug repositioning effectiveness during a sanitary crisis. Therefore, a critical evaluation of the evidence generated can guide future efforts in analogous situations. We aimed to analyze the RCTs assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19, describe their internal validity and power, and evaluate their contribution to the precision of the combined evidence for assessing the mortality outcome. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGSThis meta-research included RCTs assessing hydroxychloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with Covid-19. It was part of an umbrella systematic review of methods/meta-research (PROSPERO: CRD42022360331) that included a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Latin America Database - Lilacs. We retrieved studies published until January 10th, 2022. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0. We analyzed methodology of the studies, precision and random error change through time from pooled evidence, study comparators, patient important outcome, power in different magnitude of effects proxy. RESULTSA total of 22 RCT were included, from that 17 (77%) assessed hospitalized patients and five (23%) outpatients setting. Mortality was related as primary endpoint in only 4 studies, however half of the studies included composite endpoints including mortality as a component. The internal validity analysis using RoB2 found that eight studies (36%) had a high risk of bias. Only one study had sufficient power to evaluate a moderate magnitude of effect (RR = 0,7 on mortality). The standard error to evaluate efficacy on mortality did not change appreciably after October 2020. From Oct 2020 to Dec 2021, 18 additional studies were published with 2,429 patients recruited. CONCLUSIONThis meta-research highlights the impact that collaborative, and network scientific research have on informing clinical decision-making. Duplicate efforts create research waste as precision analysis shows that after October 2020, there was not appreciably changes in the precision of the pooled RCT evidence to estimate the hydroxychloroquine effect on mortality. What is new?O_LIAfter Oct2020, grouped RCT on the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 showed that precision estimate has not been appreciably modified in subsequent studies. C_LIO_LIAt least 18 RCT (n=2,429) could potentially be saved through collaborative work. C_LIO_LIMost individual studies did not have sufficient power to assess the size of moderate effect size on mortality. C_LIO_LIStrengthening cooperation and integrating research centers can decrease research waste.

L.; Hu, M.; Clarke, T. C.; McEvoy, R.; Amend, K. L.; Bleacher, D. C.; McMahill-Walraven, C. N.; Seeger, J. D.; Secora, A.; Djibo, D. A.; Song, J.; Selvam, N.; DeShazo, J. P.; Clifford, R.; Abente, E.; Chillarige, Y.; Forshee, R. A.; Anderson, S. A.; Shoaibi, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301676\nImportance Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure. Objective To evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. Design Monthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and Exposures Persons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health Outcomes Twenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. Results Overall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. Conclusions Results were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\n",

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and severe adverse events (&#34;Severe AEs&#34;) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coalescing evidence shows that food habits circulate through social relationships. However, seniors&#39; social networks and unhealthy dietary choices remain underexplored, particularly within rural Eastern Europe&#39;s unique socioeconomic and cultural contexts. We investigate how social networks affect the consumption of processed foods high in salt among community-dwelling older adults (64 years of age and older) from a Romanian rural community. We use an observational cross-sectional quantitative approach (a personal network research design) to collect self-reported information about the study participants (egos; n = 83), their social contacts (alters), and the relationships among them (ego-alter and alter-alter ties). We fit multi-level, mixed-effects models, clustering alters by their egos, and show that older adults eating processed food high in salt are more likely to be connected to alters with similar eating habits (assortativity). This result is of particular relevance when considering the nutritional health of older adults, as it implies that interventions targeting this demographic should extend beyond the individual to encompass their social environment. Despite the cross-sectional approach limitations, our work may enrich the understanding of dietary patterns among rural Eastern European seniors and provide an empirical foundation for designing targeted interventions that can mitigate health risks associated with high-salt diets in older populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39).

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEAt the beginning of 2020, hydroxychloroquine showed promising in vitro activity for Covid-19 and several studies were oriented to assess its safety and efficacy. However, after a few months, hydroxychloroquine has proved ineffective. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed quickly and in different settings represent the scientific communitys capacity to assess drug repositioning effectiveness during a sanitary crisis. Therefore, a critical evaluation of the evidence generated can guide future efforts in analogous situations. We aimed to analyze the RCTs assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19, describe their internal validity and power, and evaluate their contribution to the precision of the combined evidence for assessing the mortality outcome.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGSThis meta-research included RCTs assessing hydroxychloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with Covid-19. It was part of an umbrella systematic review of methods/meta-research (PROSPERO: CRD42022360331) that included a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Latin America Database - Lilacs. We retrieved studies published until January 10th, 2022. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0. We analyzed methodology of the studies, precision and random error change through time from pooled evidence, study comparators, patient important outcome, power in different magnitude of effects proxy.

RESULTSA total of 22 RCT were included, from that 17 (77%) assessed hospitalized patients and five (23%) outpatients setting. Mortality was related as primary endpoint in only 4 studies, however half of the studies included composite endpoints including mortality as a component. The internal validity analysis using RoB2 found that eight studies (36%) had a high risk of bias. Only one study had sufficient power to evaluate a moderate magnitude of effect (RR = 0,7 on mortality). The standard error to evaluate efficacy on mortality did not change appreciably after October 2020. From Oct 2020 to Dec 2021, 18 additional studies were published with 2,429 patients recruited.

CONCLUSIONThis meta-research highlights the impact that collaborative, and network scientific research have on informing clinical decision-making. Duplicate efforts create research waste as precision analysis shows that after October 2020, there was not appreciably changes in the precision of the pooled RCT evidence to estimate the hydroxychloroquine effect on mortality.

What is new?O_LIAfter Oct2020, grouped RCT on the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 showed that precision estimate has not been appreciably modified in subsequent studies.
C_LIO_LIAt least 18 RCT (n=2,429) could potentially be saved through collaborative work.
C_LIO_LIMost individual studies did not have sufficient power to assess the size of moderate effect size on mortality.
C_LIO_LIStrengthening cooperation and integrating research centers can decrease research waste.

        <p class="abstract">Importance Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure. Objective To evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. Design Monthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and Exposures Persons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health Outcomes Twenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. Results Overall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. Conclusions Results were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p>
