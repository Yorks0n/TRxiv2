Vaccines may have non-specific effects. Objective: Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study Selection: All RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on serious adverse events (\"SAEs\") and severe adverse events (\"Severe AEs\") as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. Results: The analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: mRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.\nHeterogeneity in deaths of despair: excess mortality in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Kandula, S.; Keyes, K. M.; Shaman, J.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301291\nThe impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.\nWhy did people not get vaccinated against COVID-19? Results from a nationwide survey among Mexican adults\nAuthors: Wrzecionkowska, D.; Stephens, C. R.; Gutierrez Reyes, J. P.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301326\nObjectiveTo explore the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Material and methodsIn October 2021, a nationwide structured telephone survey (disproportionate stratified sampling) was conducted regarding COVID-19 pandemics, including vaccination experience. To examine associations between inoculation and other characteristics, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were applied. ResultsOut of 3 126 adults, 68% reported complete vaccination and 21% only the first dose, while 11% remained unvaccinated. Non-vaccination was associated with being younger, male, without a partner, low socioeconomic level, and no previous diagnosis of hypertension, obesity or diabetes. Furthermore, the non-vaccinated were less likely to have tested for COVID-19, and more likely to consider COVID-19 as low severe and not real compared with the vaccinated. Using logistic regression models: place of residence, marital status, educational level, age, BMI, testing for COVID-19, and the perception of COVID-19 (severe and real) were significant predictors of non-vaccination. The predominant reasons for not getting vaccinated were: 63% \"external barriers\" (e.g., not being able to attend an appointment), and 37% \"internal motives\" (e.g., \"vaccine does not work\"). ConclusionsThe causes of non-vaccination against COVID-19 are related to both social and geographical determinants. Addressing external barriers is necessary in order to promote equity in vaccination. Reviewing the results in the context of earlier studies on the willingness to vaccinate, the gap between intention and vaccination is notable.\nCross-disciplinary rapid scoping review of structural racial and caste discrimination associated with population health disparities in the 21st Century\nAuthors: Rasali, D. P.; WOODRUFF, B. M.; ALZYOUD, F. A.; KIEL, D.; SCHAFFZIN, K. T.; OSEI, W. D.; FORD, C. L.; JOHNSON, S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301383\nA cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination. HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories. C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries. C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century. C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste. C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism.

The current study has investigated the protracted immune responses of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. One year subsequent to the systematically implemented SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign among HCWs, humoral and cellular immune responses were sustained at levels as high as or higher than those immediately following the 3rd booster vaccination. Persisting immunity has highlighted the resilience and lasting memory exhibited in HCW defense against the virus.\nSex and gender differences in adverse events following receipt of influenza and COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers\nAuthors: Yin, A.; Wang, N.; Shea, P. J.; Rosser, E.; Kuo, H.; Shapiro, J. R.; Fenstermacher, K. Z.; Pekosz, A.; Rothman, R. E.; Klein, S. L.; Morgan, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301440\nIntroduction: Active and passive surveillance studies have found that a greater proportion of females report adverse events (AE) following receipt of either the COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccine compared to males. We sought to determine the intersection of biological sex and sociocultural gender differences in prospective active reporting of vaccine outcomes, which remains poorly characterized. Methods: This cohort study enrolled Johns Hopkins Health System healthcare workers (HCWs) who were recruited from the annual fall 2019-2022 influenza vaccine and the fall 2022 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine campaigns. Vaccine recipients were enrolled the day of vaccination and AE surveys were administered two days post-vaccination (DPV) for bivalent COVID-19 and Influenza vaccine recipients. Data were collected regarding the presence of a series of solicited local and systemic AEs. Open-ended answers about participants' experiences with AEs also were collected for the COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Results: Females were more likely to report local AEs after influenza (OR=2.28, p=0.001) or COVID-19 (OR=2.57, p=0.008) vaccination compared to males, regardless of age or race. Males and females had comparable probabilities of reporting systemic AEs after influenza (OR=1.18, p=0.552) or COVID-19 (OR=0.96, p=0.907) vaccination. Exogenous hormones from birth control use did not impact the rates of reported AEs following COVID-19 vaccination among reproductive-aged female HCWs. Women reported more interruptions in their daily routine following COVID-19 vaccination than men and were more likely to seek out self-treatment. More women than men scheduled their COVID-19 vaccination before their days off in anticipation of AEs. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for sex- and gender-inclusive policies to inform more effective occupational health vaccination strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential disruption of AEs on occupational responsibilities following mandated vaccination for healthcare workers and to more fully characterize the post-vaccination behavioral differences between men and women.\nFrom a pandemic to a cost of living crisis. Associations between financial wellbeing, financial uncertainty and mental health in contemporary Britain\nAuthors: Wels, J.; Hamarat, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301283\nBackgroundFinancial wellbeing is a determinant of mental health but the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis generated by inflation have negatively impacted both aspects. MethodsData come from Understanding Society. We address long-term (1991-2022) relationships between poor financial wellbeing (PFW), poor financial prospect (PFP) and psychological distress (GHQ-36 \u003e= 9) using a conditional logit model as well as recent trends (2019-2022) using a Latent Growth Modelling (LGM) based on the diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV) accounting for socio-demographic covariates and measures of deprivation. Multiple imputations were used for non-response. ResultsRecent years have seen a surge in GHQ cases and PFP and consistent association between GHQ and PFW (OR=1.31; 95%CI=1.29;1.33) and PFP (OR= 1.13; 95%CI=1.12;1.15) are observed. The association between PFW and GHQ-36 slightly weakened during the pandemic [WLSMV: 0.30 (95%CI= 0.28; 0.33) in 2019; 0.27 (95%CI= 0.25; 0.30) in 2020] but strengthened for PFP [0.22 (95%CI= 0.19; 0.25) in 2019, 0.26 (95%CI= 0.23; 0.29) in 2020]. Those renting and those in the most deprived areas were more likely to report PFW whilst those in the least deprived areas and having a mortgage experiencing greater PFP, both contributing to explain psychological distress. DiscussionPolicies implemented during the pandemic might have contributed to partially reduce the association between financial wellbeing and mental health but post-pandemic associations in the context of an early cost of living crisis show an increased risk with those living in the most deprived areas or not owing an accommodation more at risk.\nMapping the Existing Body of Knowledge on New and Repurposed TB Vaccine Implementation: A Scoping Review\nAuthors: Buis, J. S. S.; Jerene, D.; Gebhard, A.; Bakker, R.; Majidulla, A.; Kerkhoff, A. D.; Limaye, R.; Pelzer, P. T.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301490\nThere is global consensus on the urgent need for a safe and effective TB vaccine for adults and adolescents to improve global TB control, and encouragingly, several promising candidates have advanced to late-stage trials. Significant gaps remain in understanding the critical factors that will facilitate the successful implementation of new and repurposed TB vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), once available. By synthesizing the existing body of knowledge, this review offers comprehensive insights into the current state of research on implementation of these adults and adolescent vaccines. This review explores four key dimensions: (1) epidemiological impact, (2) costing, cost-effectiveness, and/or economic impact, (3) acceptability, and the (4) feasibility of implementation; this includes implementation strategies of target populations, and health system capabilities. Results indicate that current research primarily consists of epidemiological and costing/cost-effectiveness/economic studies in India, China, and South Africa, mainly modelling with M72/AS01, BCG revaccination, and generic vaccines. Varying endpoints, vaccine efficacies, and vaccination coverages were used. Globally, new, and repurposed TB vaccines are estimated to save millions of lives. Economically, these vaccines also demonstrate promise with expected cost-effectiveness in most countries. Projected outcomes were dependent on vaccine characteristics, target population, implementation strategy, timing of roll out, TB burden/country context, and vaccination coverage. Potential barriers for vaccine acceptability included TB-related stigma, need for a second dose, and cost, while low pricing, community and civil society engagement and heightened public TB awareness were potential enablers in China, India, and South Africa. Potential implementation strategies considered spanned from mass campaigns to integration within existing vaccine programs and the primary target group studied was the general population, and adults and adolescents. In conclusion, future research must have broader geographical representations to better understand what is needed to inform tailored vaccine programs to accommodate diverse country contexts and population groups to achieve optimal implementation and impact. Furthermore, this review underscores the scarcity of research on acceptability of new and repurposed TB vaccines and their delivery among potential beneficiaries, the most promising implementation strategies, and the health system capabilities necessary for implementation. The absence of this knowledge in these areas emphasizes the crucial need for future research to ensure effective TB vaccine implementation in high burden settings worldwide.\nPredicting COVID-19 Infection Among Older Syrian Refugees in Lebanon: A Multi-Wave Survey\nAuthors: Abi Zeid, B.; El Khoury, T.; Abdulrahim, S. R.; Ghattas, H.; McCall, S. J.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301436\nBackgroundOlder refugees, exposed to a cluster of biological and social vulnerabilities, are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and its complications. This study developed and internally validated a predictive model estimating COVID-19 infection risk among older Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Additionally, it described the barriers to PCR testing among those who reported a COVID-19 infection. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional analysis of a five-wave longitudinal study conducted between September 2020 and March 2022. Syrian refugees aged 50 years or older living in households that received assistance from a humanitarian organization were interviewed by phone. Self-reported COVID-19 infection was the outcome of interest. The predictors were identified using adaptive LASSO regression. The model performance and discrimination were presented using the calibration slope and the Area Under the Curve. FindingsOf 2,886 participants (median [IQR] age: 56[52-62]; 52.9% males), 283 individuals (9.8%) reported a COVID-19 infection at least once. Six predictors for COVID-19 infection were identified: living outside informal tented settlements, having elementary and preparatory education or above, having chronic conditions, not receiving cash assistance, being water insecure and having unmet waste management needs. The model had moderate discrimination and good calibration. Nearly half of the cases were diagnosed through PCR testing. The main reasons for not testing were perception that the tests were unnecessary (n=91[63.6%]) or inability to afford them (n=46[32.2%]). InterpretationHigh-risk individuals should be targeted based on predictive models incorporating social determinants. Implementing awareness campaigns, screening measures, and cash assistance may reduce vulnerability in future pandemics. FundingELRHAs Research for Health in Humanitarian Crisis Programme and AUB University Research Board. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSA literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed and Google Scholar for studies published between February 1, 2020, and June 14, 2022, with the objective of developing a predictive model or examining the associated factors of COVID-19 infection among older adults or refugees. Different combinations of the following keywords were used in our research: \"COVID-19 infection\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"Coronavirus\", \"predictors\", \"risk factors\", \"refugees\", \"migrants\", and \"Syrian\". Previous evidence has shown that displaced populations are considered vulnerable groups highly susceptible to the impacts of COVID-19, due to their exposure to a combination of biological and psychosocial vulnerabilities. In Lebanon, Syrian refugees face an elevated risk of infection and its complications, mainly due to the deterioration of their living conditions resulting from the multiple crises burdening the country. The literature search featured the following potential predictors: age, gender, educational attainment, marital status, housing conditions, socioeconomic status, and presence of chronic illnesses. However, to date, no studies have developed predictive models of COVID-19 infection focusing on Syrian refugees in the MENA region. Additionally, there has been a scarcity of predictive models incorporating social determinants to assess the risk of infection among refugees or older adults in this context. Hence, identifying individuals who are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and its severity amongst vulnerable populations is important to inform better targeting of assistance in future outbreaks and to reduce the risk of infection and its complications. Added value of the studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that exclusively incorporates social determinants into a prediction model of COVID-19 infection among older Syrian refugees. Out of 2,886 participants, 283 individuals (9.8%) reported experiencing COVID-19 infection at least once. Six predictors of COVID-19 infection among older Syrian refugees were identified: living outside informal tented settlements, having elementary and preparatory education or above, having chronic conditions, not receiving cash assistance, being water insecure and having unmet waste management needs. Despite the efforts and the collaboration between UNHCR, several NGOs and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health to cover the cost of COVID-19 testing and to raise awareness about COVID-19 symptoms and the necessity of testing, only half of the cases were diagnosed through PCR or lateral flow tests. The main reasons for not testing were perceptions that it was unnecessary or inability to afford the tests. Implications of all the available evidenceThe predictors identified in this study could be used to inform targeting efforts by humanitarian organizations to provide assistance to Syrian refugees at higher risk of COVID-19 infection or infections in future pandemics. In addition, it will be important for humanitarian organisations to continue outreach efforts outside of informal tented settlements into the community to reach the most vulnerable to COVID infection with interventions. Furthermore, intensifying awareness campaigns among Syrian refugees about testing availability and the importance of visiting a healthcare professional, and considering the implementation of free testing in primary healthcare centers and pharmacies will be essential to control infectious diseases in future pandemics.\nShort-term outcomes of the digital combined lifestyle intervention CooL-MiGuide: a descriptive case series study\nAuthors: Philippens, N.; Janssen, E.; Kremers, S.; Crutzen, R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301417\nIntroductionThe objective of this study is to investigate the changes over time in anthropometrics, behaviours and health perceptions after eight months of participation in the Combined Lifestyle Intervention (CLI) CooL-MiGuide, a digital version of the Coaching on Lifestyle (CooL) intervention with the add-on of a digital platform and an app. MethodLongitudinal data were collected between January 2022 and December 2023 from adults, mainly in the South-Western area of the Netherlands, that meet the inclusion criteria for the CLI (i.e. being obese (Body Mass Index (BMI)\u003e30) or being overweight (25",

        <p class="abstract">Importance: Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects. Objective: Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study Selection: All RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and severe adverse events (&#34;Severe AEs&#34;) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. Results: The analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: mRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo explore the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

Material and methodsIn October 2021, a nationwide structured telephone survey (disproportionate stratified sampling) was conducted regarding COVID-19 pandemics, including vaccination experience. To examine associations between inoculation and other characteristics, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were applied.

ResultsOut of 3 126 adults, 68% reported complete vaccination and 21% only the first dose, while 11% remained unvaccinated. Non-vaccination was associated with being younger, male, without a partner, low socioeconomic level, and no previous diagnosis of hypertension, obesity or diabetes. Furthermore, the non-vaccinated were less likely to have tested for COVID-19, and more likely to consider COVID-19 as low severe and not real compared with the vaccinated. Using logistic regression models: place of residence, marital status, educational level, age, BMI, testing for COVID-19, and the perception of COVID-19 (severe and real) were significant predictors of non-vaccination. The predominant reasons for not getting vaccinated were: 63% &#34;external barriers&#34; (e.g., not being able to attend an appointment), and 37% &#34;internal motives&#34; (e.g., &#34;vaccine does not work&#34;).

ConclusionsThe causes of non-vaccination against COVID-19 are related to both social and geographical determinants. Addressing external barriers is necessary in order to promote equity in vaccination. Reviewing the results in the context of earlier studies on the willingness to vaccinate, the gap between intention and vaccination is notable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause  allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination.

HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories.
C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global  caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries.
C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century.
C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste.
C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism.

The current study has investigated the protracted immune responses of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. One year subsequent to the systematically implemented SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign among HCWs, humoral and cellular immune responses were sustained at levels as high as or higher than those immediately following the 3rd booster vaccination. Persisting immunity has highlighted the resilience and lasting memory exhibited in HCW defense against the virus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Active and passive surveillance studies have found that a greater proportion of females report adverse events (AE) following receipt of either the COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccine compared to males. We sought to determine the intersection of biological sex and sociocultural gender differences in prospective active reporting of vaccine outcomes, which remains poorly characterized. Methods: This cohort study enrolled Johns Hopkins Health System healthcare workers (HCWs) who were recruited from the annual fall 2019-2022 influenza vaccine and the fall 2022 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine campaigns. Vaccine recipients were enrolled the day of vaccination and AE surveys were administered two days post-vaccination (DPV) for bivalent COVID-19 and Influenza vaccine recipients. Data were collected regarding the presence of a series of solicited local and systemic AEs. Open-ended answers about participants&#39; experiences with AEs also were collected for the COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Results: Females were more likely to report local AEs after influenza (OR=2.28, p=0.001) or COVID-19 (OR=2.57, p=0.008) vaccination compared to males, regardless of age or race. Males and females had comparable probabilities of reporting systemic AEs after influenza (OR=1.18, p=0.552) or COVID-19 (OR=0.96, p=0.907) vaccination. Exogenous hormones from birth control use did not impact the rates of reported AEs following COVID-19 vaccination among reproductive-aged female HCWs. Women reported more interruptions in their daily routine following COVID-19 vaccination than men and were more likely to seek out self-treatment. More women than men scheduled their COVID-19 vaccination before their days off in anticipation of AEs. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for sex- and gender-inclusive policies to inform more effective occupational health vaccination strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential disruption of AEs on occupational responsibilities following mandated vaccination for healthcare workers and to more fully characterize the post-vaccination behavioral differences between men and women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFinancial wellbeing is a determinant of mental health but the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis generated by inflation have negatively impacted both aspects.

MethodsData come from Understanding Society. We address long-term (1991-2022) relationships between poor financial wellbeing (PFW), poor financial prospect (PFP) and psychological distress (GHQ-36 &gt;= 9) using a conditional logit model as well as recent trends (2019-2022) using a Latent Growth Modelling (LGM) based on the diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV) accounting for socio-demographic covariates and measures of deprivation. Multiple imputations were used for non-response.

ResultsRecent years have seen a surge in GHQ cases and PFP and consistent association between GHQ and PFW (OR=1.31; 95%CI=1.29;1.33) and PFP (OR= 1.13; 95%CI=1.12;1.15) are observed. The association between PFW and GHQ-36 slightly weakened during the pandemic [WLSMV: 0.30 (95%CI= 0.28; 0.33) in 2019; 0.27 (95%CI= 0.25; 0.30) in 2020] but strengthened for PFP [0.22 (95%CI= 0.19; 0.25) in 2019, 0.26 (95%CI= 0.23; 0.29) in 2020]. Those renting and those in the most deprived areas were more likely to report PFW whilst those in the least deprived areas and having a mortgage experiencing greater PFP, both contributing to explain psychological distress.

DiscussionPolicies implemented during the pandemic might have contributed to partially reduce the association between financial wellbeing and mental health but post-pandemic associations in the context of an early cost of living crisis show an increased risk with those living in the most deprived areas or not owing an accommodation more at risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is global consensus on the urgent need for a safe and effective TB vaccine for adults and adolescents to improve global TB control, and encouragingly, several promising candidates have advanced to late-stage trials. Significant gaps remain in understanding the critical factors that will facilitate the successful implementation of new and repurposed TB vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), once available. By synthesizing the existing body of knowledge, this review offers comprehensive insights into the current state of research on implementation of these adults and adolescent vaccines. This review explores four key dimensions: (1) epidemiological impact, (2) costing, cost-effectiveness, and/or economic impact, (3) acceptability, and the (4) feasibility of implementation; this includes implementation strategies of target populations, and health system capabilities. Results indicate that current research primarily consists of epidemiological and costing/cost-effectiveness/economic studies in India, China, and South Africa, mainly modelling with M72/AS01, BCG revaccination, and generic vaccines. Varying endpoints, vaccine efficacies, and vaccination coverages were used. Globally, new, and repurposed TB vaccines are estimated to save millions of lives. Economically, these vaccines also demonstrate promise with expected cost-effectiveness in most countries. Projected outcomes were dependent on vaccine characteristics, target population, implementation strategy, timing of roll out, TB burden/country context, and vaccination coverage. Potential barriers for vaccine acceptability included TB-related stigma, need for a second dose, and cost, while low pricing, community and civil society engagement and heightened public TB awareness were potential enablers in China, India, and South Africa. Potential implementation strategies considered spanned from mass campaigns to integration within existing vaccine programs and the primary target group studied was the general population, and adults and adolescents. In conclusion, future research must have broader geographical representations to better understand what is needed to inform tailored vaccine programs to accommodate diverse country contexts and population groups to achieve optimal implementation and impact. Furthermore, this review underscores the scarcity of research on acceptability of new and repurposed TB vaccines and their delivery among potential beneficiaries, the most promising implementation strategies, and the health system capabilities necessary for implementation. The absence of this knowledge in these areas emphasizes the crucial need for future research to ensure effective TB vaccine implementation in high burden settings worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOlder refugees, exposed to a cluster of biological and social vulnerabilities, are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and its complications. This study developed and internally validated a predictive model estimating COVID-19 infection risk among older Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Additionally, it described the barriers to PCR testing among those who reported a COVID-19 infection.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional analysis of a five-wave longitudinal study conducted between September 2020 and March 2022. Syrian refugees aged 50 years or older living in households that received assistance from a humanitarian organization were interviewed by phone. Self-reported COVID-19 infection was the outcome of interest. The predictors were identified using adaptive LASSO regression. The model performance and discrimination were presented using the calibration slope and the Area Under the Curve.

FindingsOf 2,886 participants (median [IQR] age: 56[52-62]; 52.9% males), 283 individuals (9.8%) reported a COVID-19 infection at least once. Six predictors for COVID-19 infection were identified: living outside informal tented settlements, having elementary and preparatory education or above, having chronic conditions, not receiving cash assistance, being water insecure and having unmet waste management needs. The model had moderate discrimination and good calibration. Nearly half of the cases were diagnosed through PCR testing. The main reasons for not testing were perception that the tests were unnecessary (n=91[63.6%]) or inability to afford them (n=46[32.2%]).

InterpretationHigh-risk individuals should be targeted based on predictive models incorporating social determinants. Implementing awareness campaigns, screening measures, and cash assistance may reduce vulnerability in future pandemics.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSA literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed and Google Scholar for studies published between February 1, 2020, and June 14, 2022, with the objective of developing a predictive model or examining the associated factors of COVID-19 infection among older adults or refugees. Different combinations of the following keywords were used in our research: &#34;COVID-19 infection&#34;, &#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34;, &#34;Coronavirus&#34;, &#34;predictors&#34;, &#34;risk factors&#34;, &#34;refugees&#34;, &#34;migrants&#34;, and &#34;Syrian&#34;. Previous evidence has shown that displaced populations are considered vulnerable groups highly susceptible to the impacts of COVID-19, due to their exposure to a combination of biological and psychosocial vulnerabilities. In Lebanon, Syrian refugees face an elevated risk of infection and its complications, mainly due to the deterioration of their living conditions resulting from the multiple crises burdening the country. The literature search featured the following potential predictors: age, gender, educational attainment, marital status, housing conditions, socioeconomic status, and presence of chronic illnesses. However, to date, no studies have developed predictive models of COVID-19 infection focusing on Syrian refugees in the MENA region. Additionally, there has been a scarcity of predictive models incorporating social determinants to assess the risk of infection among refugees or older adults in this context. Hence, identifying individuals who are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and its severity amongst vulnerable populations is important to inform better targeting of assistance in future outbreaks and to reduce the risk of infection and its complications.

Added value of the studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that exclusively incorporates social determinants into a prediction model of COVID-19 infection among older Syrian refugees. Out of 2,886 participants, 283 individuals (9.8%) reported experiencing COVID-19 infection at least once. Six predictors of COVID-19 infection among older Syrian refugees were identified: living outside informal tented settlements, having elementary and preparatory education or above, having chronic conditions, not receiving cash assistance, being water insecure and having unmet waste management needs. Despite the efforts and the collaboration between UNHCR, several NGOs and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health to cover the cost of COVID-19 testing and to raise awareness about COVID-19 symptoms and the necessity of testing, only half of the cases were diagnosed through PCR or lateral flow tests. The main reasons for not testing were perceptions that it was unnecessary or inability to afford the tests.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe predictors identified in this study could be used to inform targeting efforts by humanitarian organizations to provide assistance to Syrian refugees at higher risk of COVID-19 infection or infections in future pandemics. In addition, it will be important for humanitarian organisations to continue outreach efforts outside of informal tented settlements into the community to reach the most vulnerable to COVID infection with interventions. Furthermore, intensifying awareness campaigns among Syrian refugees about testing availability and the importance of visiting a healthcare professional, and considering the implementation of free testing in primary healthcare centers and pharmacies will be essential to control infectious diseases in future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe objective of this study is to investigate the changes over time in anthropometrics, behaviours and health perceptions after eight months of participation in the Combined Lifestyle Intervention (CLI) CooL-MiGuide, a digital version of the Coaching on Lifestyle (CooL) intervention with the add-on of a digital platform and an app.

MethodLongitudinal data were collected between January 2022 and December 2023 from adults, mainly in the South-Western area of the Netherlands, that meet the inclusion criteria for the CLI (i.e. being obese (Body Mass Index (BMI)&gt;30) or being overweight (25&lt;BMI&lt;30) combined with comorbidity; and being sufficiently motivated). We collected a broad set of data at baseline (T0) and after eight months of participation (T1) on anthropometrics (self-reported weight, length, waist circumference), control and support (self-mastery, social support), physical activity (sedentary time on least/most active days, physical active minutes), diet attentiveness (attentiveness to meal composition, amounts of food and consuming), alcohol consumption, smoking, perceived fitness (perceived health, fitness when waking, fitness during daytime, impact daily stress), sleep and stress. Changes over time were analyzed using paired t-tests comparing T1 to baseline. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohens d.

ResultsThe results show positive changes after eight months in anthropometrics, sedentary time, diet attentiveness, sleep, stress, fitness, and perceived health of the participants. Largest effect sizes were found for weight (Cohens d=0.62, average weight loss of 3.82kg), perceived health (Cohens d=0.58) and perceived fitness of the participants when waking and during daytime (Cohens d=0.41 and 0.52 respectively).

ConclusionCooL-MiGuide participants show relevant changes in the essential constructs perceived health and weight. The digital version of CooL can be a valuable alternative for people who prefer participation from a location of their choice.</p>
