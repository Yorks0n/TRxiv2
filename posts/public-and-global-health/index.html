It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania. Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [\u0026ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age \u003e90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P\u003c0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P\u003c0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P\u003c0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study. ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.\nEffects of nutritional supplements on antibody levels in pregnant women vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Han, X.; Chen, B.; Fu, X.; Gong, Y.; Yang, W.; CHEN, Q.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292747\nBackgroundBecause of the significantly higher demand for nutrients during pregnancy, pregnant women are more likely to have nutrient deficiencies, which may adversely affect maternal and fetal health. The effect of nutritional supplements on the immune effects of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during pregnancy is not clear. MethodsIn a multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled 873 pregnant women aged 18-45 y in Guangdong, China. The general demographic characteristics of pregnant women and their use of nutritional supplements were investigated, and the serum antibody levels induced by inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were measured. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between nutritional supplements and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. ResultsOf the 873 pregnant women enrolled, 825 (94.5%) took folic acid during pregnancy, 165 (18.9%) took iron supplements, and 197 (22.6%) took DHA. All pregnant women received at least one dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and the positive rates of serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were 44.7% and 46.4%, respectively. After adjustment for confounding factors, whether pregnant women took folic acid, iron supplements, or DHA did not influence NAb positivity or IgG positivity (P \u003e 0.05).Compared with pregnant women who did not take folic acid, the odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 NAb and IgG antibody in pregnant women who took folic acid were 0.69 (P = 0.282; 95% CI, 0.35-1.35) and 1.31 (P = 0.456; 95% CI, 0.64-2.67), respectively. Compared with pregnant women who did not take iron supplements, the ORs for the presence of NAb and IgG antibody in pregnant women who took iron supplements were 1.22 (P = 0.336; 95% CI, 0.81-1.84) and 1.01 (P = 0.956; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54), respectively. Similarly, the ORs for NAb and IgG antibody were 0.74 (P = 0.125; 95% CI, 0.51-1.08) and 0.97 (P = 0.881; 95% CI, 0.66-1.44) in pregnant women who took DHA compared with those who did not. ConclusionsNutritional supplementation with folic acid, iron, or DHA during pregnancy was not associated with antibody levels in pregnant women who received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\nDesignathons in Health Research: A Global Systematic Review\nAuthors: Tieosapjaroen, W.; Chen, E.; Ritchwood, T.; Li, C.; Conklin, J. L.; Babatunde, A.; Ongkeko, A.; Nwaozuru, U.; Tucker, J. D.; Ong, J. J.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292758\nBackgroundA designathon is a three-stage participatory activity informed by design thinking and rapid prototyping that includes preparation with end-users, an intensive period of collaborative teamwork, and evaluation of solutions by topic experts or community partners. A few previous systematic reviews have focused on the use of designathons in health. This study synthesised how designathons were organised and implementation-related factors to address health challenges. MethodsWe searched Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for peer-reviewed articles until November 29, 2022. The systemic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389685). ResultsIn total, 4,947 citations were identified, with 38 studies included in this review. Most studies were from high-income countries (26, 68%). The median number of participating teams was eight (IQR 5, 15), and the duration of the intensive collaboration phase ranged from three hours to seven days. The final products (i.e., ideas and prototypes) related to four themes: mobile applications, educational programs, medical devices, and other prototypes. Common evaluation criteria were feasibility, innovation or creativity, and impact. The most common facilitators were including diverse participants and having high-quality mentorship. . The most common barriers related to planning and implementing the designathon, and engaging diverse participants to participate. There were limited data on required resources and further implementation of solutions after designathons and no data on cost-effectiveness. ConclusionDesignathons are a promising tool for fostering innovative and person-centred solutions to address health challenges. Given its adaptability in terms of budget, mode of delivery, and involvement of diverse participants including end-users, designathons can be implemented in a wide range of contexts to address various health issues.\nQuantification of Covid-19 Vaccine Coercion in India: A Survey Study\nAuthors: Raman, B.; Banerjee, A.; Vajjala, S. M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293089\nIntroduction: Informed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings. Results: A total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48% to 25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67% to 26.14%) and non student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% to 31.43%). Conclusion: A significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent. These results are of paramount importance for future policies as well as for posterity.\nIdentification of COVID-19 Vaccine-Hesitancy Predictors in the United States\nAuthors: Saldarriaga, E. M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292772\nVaccine hesitancy is complex, multi-causative phenomenon that undermines public health efforts to contain the spread of infectious diseases. Improving our understanding of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy might improve our capacity to address it. We used the results of the May 2021 ASPEs survey on COVID-19 vaccine-hesitancy which estimated the proportion of adults that felt hesitant of unsure towards taking the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available at the county-level. We developed a prediction model to identify the most important predictors of vaccine-hesitancy. The potential predictors included demographic characteristics, the CDCs social vulnerability index, and the Republican Partys voting share in the 2020 presidential election as a proxy of political affiliation, both at the county-level. The most important drivers of hesitancy included low educational attainment, proportion of Black/African American population, and political affiliation. These results deepen our understanding of the phenomenon and could help design more targeted interventions to reduce hesitancy in specific sub-groups of the population.\nAssessment of Bacteriological Quality and Associated Risk Factors of Raw Milk Marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda\nAuthors: Emmanuel, N.; Enock, K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293027\nMilk has tremendous nutritional value for both people and animals, but because it also contains water, many different kinds of microbes can develop in it. Dairy products are still sold in both regular and unofficial marketplaces in Rwanda. Significant dangers to human health are associated with milk sold in unregulated markets. The aim of the present study was to assess the bacteriological quality and associated risk factors of raw milk marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda. 126 samples were collected among milk transporters from 14 sectors of Nyagatare district, Rwanda, where 9 samples were taken from each sector and analyzed in veterinary microbiology lab of University of Rwanda, Nyagatare campus. The bacterial analysis was based on carrying out total bacterial count, Coliform count, enumeration of Staphylococcus species and enumeration of Salmonella species. Milk transportes were also asked about risk factors associated with bacterial contamination of raw milk. The total bacterial count, Coliform count and enumerated Staphylococcus species had range from 7.8 x 104 -80 x 104 cfu/mL, 24 x 101 and 80 x 101 cfu/mL and 20.8 x 101 and 211 x 101 cfu/mL respectively and highest prevalence of Salmonella to be 1.58 %. The level of significant was not significant between various bacterial level and several risk factors except for total bacterial count and knowledge about diseases transmitted by raw milk at p \u003c 0.05. It is, therefore, highly recommended that all concerned parties should increase awareness about diseases transmitted by raw milk among milk transporters in Nyagatare district among others.\nNew tuberculosis vaccines in India: Modelling the potential health and economic impacts of adolescent/adult vaccination with M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination\nAuthors: Clark, R. A.; Weerasuriya, C. K.; Portnoy, A.; Mukandavire, C.; Quaife, M.; Bakker, R.; Scarponi, D.; Harris, R. C.; Rade, K.; Mattoo, S. K.; Tumu, D.; Menzies, N. A.; White, R. G.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.24.23286406\nBackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies. MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives. ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease. ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.\nPreparedness in practice: An outbreak science approach to studying public health emergency response\nAuthors: Moore, M.; Robertson, H.; Rosado, D.; Graeden, E.; Carlson, C. J.; Katz, R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291861\nOutbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.\nSelf-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality\nAuthors: Yuan, H.; Plekhanova, T.; Walmsley, R.; Reynolds, A. C.; Maddison, K. J.; Bucan, M.; Gehrman, P.; Rowlands, A.; Ray, D. W.; Bennett, D.; McVeigh, J.; Straker, L.; Eastwood, P.; Kyle, S. D.; Doherty, A.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292251\nBackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (\u003c6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77). InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included \"wearable\", \"actigraphy\" or \"accelerometer\" in combination with \"sleep stage\" or \"sleep classification\", and \"polysomnography\". Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n\u003c100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes. Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies. Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.\nFactors influencing COVID-19 vaccination decision-making among African American and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women in Deep South\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Byrd, T.; Qiao, S.; Torres, M. E.; Li, X.; Liu, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292951\nBackground COVID-19 vaccination is vital for ending the pandemic but concerns about its safety among pregnant and postpartum women, especially among African American (AA) and Hispanic women, persist. This study aims to explore factors that influence vaccination decision-making among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women through womens experiences and maternal care providers (MCPs) observations. Methods From January and August 2022, we conducted semi-structured interviews with AA and Hispanic women and MCPs. Participants were recruited from obstetric and pediatric clinics in South Carolina, and all births took place after March 2020. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. Results The study involved 19 AA and 20 Hispanic women, along with 9 MCPs, and revealed both barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. The factors that influence pregnant and postpartum womens decision about COVID-19 vaccine uptake included: 1) awareness of health threats associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 2) vaccine availability and accessibility, 3) vaccine-related knowledge and exposure to misinformation, 4) concerns regarding pre-existing health conditions and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, 5) emotional factors associated with vaccination decision-making processes, 6) concerns about the well-being of infants, 7) cultural perspectives, and 8) encouragement by trusted supporters. Conclusion Findings suggest that reliable information, social support, and trusted doctors advice can motivate COVID-19 vaccination. However, barriers such as misinformation, mistrust in the health care system, and fears related to potential side effects impede vaccination uptake among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women. Future interventions should target these barriers, along with health disparities, involve trusted doctors in outreach, and initiate vaccine conversations to promote vaccination among this population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere have been differential mortality rates from Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in different parts of the world. It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania.

Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [&amp;ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age &gt;90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P&lt;0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P&lt;0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P&lt;0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study.

ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBecause of the significantly higher demand for nutrients during pregnancy, pregnant women are more likely to have nutrient deficiencies, which may adversely affect maternal and fetal health. The effect of nutritional supplements on the immune effects of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during pregnancy is not clear.

MethodsIn a multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled 873 pregnant women aged 18-45 y in Guangdong, China. The general demographic characteristics of pregnant women and their use of nutritional supplements were investigated, and the serum antibody levels induced by inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were measured. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between nutritional supplements and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

ResultsOf the 873 pregnant women enrolled, 825 (94.5%) took folic acid during pregnancy, 165 (18.9%) took iron supplements, and 197 (22.6%) took DHA. All pregnant women received at least one dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and the positive rates of serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were 44.7% and 46.4%, respectively. After adjustment for confounding factors, whether pregnant women took folic acid, iron supplements, or DHA did not influence NAb positivity or IgG positivity (P &gt; 0.05).Compared with pregnant women who did not take folic acid, the odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 NAb and IgG antibody in pregnant women who took folic acid were 0.69 (P = 0.282; 95% CI, 0.35-1.35) and 1.31 (P = 0.456; 95% CI, 0.64-2.67), respectively. Compared with pregnant women who did not take iron supplements, the ORs for the presence of NAb and IgG antibody in pregnant women who took iron supplements were 1.22 (P = 0.336; 95% CI, 0.81-1.84) and 1.01 (P = 0.956; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54), respectively. Similarly, the ORs for NAb and IgG antibody were 0.74 (P = 0.125; 95% CI, 0.51-1.08) and 0.97 (P = 0.881; 95% CI, 0.66-1.44) in pregnant women who took DHA compared with those who did not.

ConclusionsNutritional supplementation with folic acid, iron, or DHA during pregnancy was not associated with antibody levels in pregnant women who received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA designathon is a three-stage participatory activity informed by design thinking and rapid prototyping that includes preparation with end-users, an intensive period of collaborative teamwork, and evaluation of solutions by topic experts or community partners. A few previous systematic reviews have focused on the use of designathons in health. This study synthesised how designathons were organised and implementation-related factors to address health challenges.

MethodsWe searched Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for peer-reviewed articles until November 29, 2022. The systemic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389685).

ResultsIn total, 4,947 citations were identified, with 38 studies included in this review. Most studies were from high-income countries (26, 68%). The median number of participating teams was eight (IQR 5, 15), and the duration of the intensive collaboration phase ranged from three hours to seven days. The final products (i.e., ideas and prototypes) related to four themes: mobile applications, educational programs, medical devices, and other prototypes. Common evaluation criteria were feasibility, innovation or creativity, and impact. The most common facilitators were including diverse participants and having high-quality mentorship. . The most common barriers related to planning and implementing the designathon, and engaging diverse participants to participate. There were limited data on required resources and further implementation of solutions after designathons and no data on cost-effectiveness.

ConclusionDesignathons are a promising tool for fostering innovative and person-centred solutions to address health challenges. Given its adaptability in terms of budget, mode of delivery, and involvement of diverse participants including end-users, designathons can be implemented in a wide range of contexts to address various health issues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Informed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings. Results: A total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48% to 25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67% to 26.14%) and non student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% to 31.43%). Conclusion: A significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent.

        <p class="abstract">Vaccine hesitancy is complex, multi-causative phenomenon that undermines public health efforts to contain the spread of infectious diseases. Improving our understanding of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy might improve our capacity to address it. We used the results of the May 2021 ASPEs survey on COVID-19 vaccine-hesitancy which estimated the proportion of adults that felt hesitant of unsure towards taking the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available at the county-level. We developed a prediction model to identify the most important predictors of vaccine-hesitancy. The potential predictors included demographic characteristics, the CDCs social vulnerability index, and the Republican Partys voting share in the 2020 presidential election as a proxy of political affiliation, both at the county-level. The most important drivers of hesitancy included low educational attainment, proportion of Black/African American population, and political affiliation. These results deepen our understanding of the phenomenon and could help design more targeted interventions to reduce hesitancy in specific sub-groups of the population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Milk has tremendous nutritional value for both people and animals, but because it also contains water, many different kinds of microbes can develop in it. Dairy products are still sold in both regular and unofficial marketplaces in Rwanda. Significant dangers to human health are associated with milk sold in unregulated markets. The aim of the present study was to assess the bacteriological quality and associated risk factors of raw milk marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda. 126 samples were collected among milk transporters from 14 sectors of Nyagatare district, Rwanda, where 9 samples were taken from each sector and analyzed in veterinary microbiology lab of University of Rwanda, Nyagatare campus. The bacterial analysis was based on carrying out total bacterial count, Coliform count, enumeration of Staphylococcus species and enumeration of Salmonella species. Milk transportes were also asked about risk factors associated with bacterial contamination of raw milk. The total bacterial count, Coliform count and enumerated Staphylococcus species had range from 7.8 x 104 -80 x 104 cfu/mL, 24 x 101 and 80 x 101 cfu/mL and 20.8 x 101 and 211 x 101 cfu/mL respectively and highest prevalence of Salmonella to be 1.58 %. The level of significant was not significant between various bacterial level and several risk factors except for total bacterial count and knowledge about diseases transmitted by raw milk at p &lt; 0.05. It is, therefore, highly recommended that all concerned parties should increase awareness about diseases transmitted by raw milk among milk transporters in Nyagatare district among others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies.

MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives.

ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease.

ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Outbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes.

MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality.

FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (&lt;6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77).

InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included &#34;wearable&#34;, &#34;actigraphy&#34; or &#34;accelerometer&#34; in combination with &#34;sleep stage&#34; or &#34;sleep classification&#34;, and &#34;polysomnography&#34;. Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n&lt;100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes.

Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background COVID-19 vaccination is vital for ending the pandemic but concerns about its safety among pregnant and postpartum women, especially among African American (AA) and Hispanic women, persist. This study aims to explore factors that influence vaccination decision-making among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women through womens experiences and maternal care providers (MCPs) observations. Methods From January and August 2022, we conducted semi-structured interviews with AA and Hispanic women and MCPs. Participants were recruited from obstetric and pediatric clinics in South Carolina, and all births took place after March 2020. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. Results The study involved 19 AA and 20 Hispanic women, along with 9 MCPs, and revealed both barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. The factors that influence pregnant and postpartum womens decision about COVID-19 vaccine uptake included: 1) awareness of health threats associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 2) vaccine availability and accessibility, 3) vaccine-related knowledge and exposure to misinformation, 4) concerns regarding pre-existing health conditions and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, 5) emotional factors associated with vaccination decision-making processes, 6) concerns about the well-being of infants, 7) cultural perspectives, and 8) encouragement by trusted supporters. Conclusion Findings suggest that reliable information, social support, and trusted doctors advice can motivate COVID-19 vaccination. However, barriers such as misinformation, mistrust in the health care system, and fears related to potential side effects impede vaccination uptake among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women. Future interventions should target these barriers, along with health disparities, involve trusted doctors in outreach, and initiate vaccine conversations to promote vaccination among this population.</p>
