Vaccines may have non-specific effects. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (\"SAEs\") and severe adverse events (\"Severe AEs\") as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.\nHeterogeneity in deaths of despair: excess mortality in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Kandula, S.; Keyes, K. M.; Shaman, J.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301291\nThe impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.\nWhy did people not get vaccinated against COVID-19? Results from a nationwide survey among Mexican adults\nAuthors: Wrzecionkowska, D.; Stephens, C. R.; Gutierrez Reyes, J. P.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301326\nObjectiveTo explore the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Material and methodsIn October 2021, a nationwide structured telephone survey (disproportionate stratified sampling) was conducted regarding COVID-19 pandemics, including vaccination experience. To examine associations between inoculation and other characteristics, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were applied. ResultsOut of 3 126 adults, 68% reported complete vaccination and 21% only the first dose, while 11% remained unvaccinated. Non-vaccination was associated with being younger, male, without a partner, low socioeconomic level, and no previous diagnosis of hypertension, obesity or diabetes. Furthermore, the non-vaccinated were less likely to have tested for COVID-19, and more likely to consider COVID-19 as low severe and not real compared with the vaccinated. Using logistic regression models: place of residence, marital status, educational level, age, BMI, testing for COVID-19, and the perception of COVID-19 (severe and real) were significant predictors of non-vaccination. The predominant reasons for not getting vaccinated were: 63% \"external barriers\" (e.g., not being able to attend an appointment), and 37% \"internal motives\" (e.g., \"vaccine does not work\"). ConclusionsThe causes of non-vaccination against COVID-19 are related to both social and geographical determinants. Addressing external barriers is necessary in order to promote equity in vaccination. Reviewing the results in the context of earlier studies on the willingness to vaccinate, the gap between intention and vaccination is notable.\nCross-disciplinary rapid scoping review of structural racial and caste discrimination associated with population health disparities in the 21st Century\nAuthors: Rasali, D. P.; WOODRUFF, B. M.; ALZYOUD, F. A.; KIEL, D.; SCHAFFZIN, K. T.; OSEI, W. D.; FORD, C. L.; JOHNSON, S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301383\nA cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination. HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories. C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries. C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century. C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste. C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism. C_LI\nSex and gender differences in adverse events following receipt of influenza and COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers\nAuthors: Yin, A.; Wang, N.; Shea, P. J.; Rosser, E.; Kuo, H.; Shapiro, J. R.; Fenstermacher, K. Z.; Pekosz, A.; Rothman, R. E.; Klein, S. L.; Morgan, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301440\nIntroductionActive and passive surveillance studies have found that a greater proportion of females report adverse events (AE) following receipt of either the COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccine compared to males. We sought to determine the intersection of biological sex and sociocultural gender differences in prospective active reporting of vaccine outcomes, which remains poorly characterized. MethodsThis cohort study enrolled Johns Hopkins Health System healthcare workers (HCWs) who were recruited from the annual fall 2019-2022 influenza vaccine and the fall 2022 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine campaigns. Vaccine recipients were enrolled the day of vaccination and AE surveys were administered two days post-vaccination (DPV) for bivalent COVID-19 and Influenza vaccine recipients. Data were collected regarding the presence of a series of solicited local and systemic AEs. Open-ended answers about participants experiences with AEs also were collected for the COVID-19 vaccine recipients. ResultsFemales were more likely to report local AEs after influenza (OR=2.28, p=0.001) or COVID-19 (OR=2.57, p=0.008) vaccination compared to males, regardless of age or race. Males and females had comparable probabilities of reporting systemic AEs after influenza (OR=1.18, p=0.552) or COVID-19 (OR=0.96, p=0.907) vaccination. Exogenous hormones from birth control use did not impact the rates of reported AEs following COVID-19 vaccination among reproductive-aged female HCWs. Women reported more interruptions in their daily routine following COVID-19 vaccination than men and were more likely to seek out self-treatment. More women than men scheduled their COVID-19 vaccination before their days off in anticipation of AEs. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for sex- and gender-inclusive policies to inform more effective occupational health vaccination strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential disruption of AEs on occupational responsibilities following mandated vaccination for healthcare workers and to more fully characterize the post-vaccination behavioral differences between men and women. KEY MESSAGEO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS{Rightarrow} Among diversely aged adults 18-64 years, females report more AEs to vaccines, including the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, than males. {Rightarrow}Vaccine AEs play a role in shaping vaccine hesitancy and uptake. {Rightarrow}Vaccine uptake related to influenza and COVID-19 are higher among men than women. {Rightarrow}Research that addresses both the sex and gender disparities of vaccine outcomes and behaviors is lacking. What this study adds{Rightarrow} This prospective active reporting study uses both quantitative and qualitative survey data to examine sex and gender differences in AEs following influenza or COVID-19 vaccination among a cohort of reproductive-aged healthcare workers. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy{Rightarrow} Sex and gender differences in AEs and perceptions relating to vaccination should drive the development of more equitable and effective vaccine strategies and policies in occupational health settings.\nThe Paradigm Shift: Reclassification of SARS-CoV-2 and Longitudinal Immune Responses in Japanese Healthcare Workers\nAuthors: Chano, T.; Kita, H.; Yamashita, T.; Fujimura, H.; Ikemoto, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301513\nUnder the aegis of the National Infectious Diseases Act, the virus transitioned from a Category 2 menace to Category 5, analogous to seasonal influenza. The current study has investigated the protracted immune responses of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. One year subsequent to the systematically implemented SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign among HCWs, humoral and cellular immune responses were sustained at levels as high as or higher than those immediately following the 3rd booster vaccination. Persisting immunity has highlighted the resilience and lasting memory exhibited in HCW defense against the virus.\nHealth literacy, information access and COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among foreign-born persons in Sweden - a focus group interview-study\nAuthors: Söderberg, M.; Swaid, J.; Aurelius, K.; Rosengren, A.; Jakobsson, K.; Magnusson, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300586\nBackgroundLower rates of COVID-19 vaccination have been observed in individuals with an immigrant background, yet if this relates to barriers to obtaining reliable information is unknown. This exploratory interview study investigated health literacy and information access as determinants for vaccination hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine among foreign-born individuals in Sweden. Methods and findingsWe used purposive sampling to recruit foreign-born adults from low- and middle-income countries and health guides and doulas who were assigned to spread COVID-19 related information in immigrant-dense urban areas. Data were collected using semi-structured focus group interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to systematic text condensation. Ten participants were included who were gainfully employed as health guides/doulas, or in other jobs, full-time students, or housewives. Four main themes emerged: 1) Limited health literacy, 2) Consequences of not using official Swedish information, 3) Decision-making on COVID-19 vaccination, and 4) Suggestions to improve information dissemination effectiveness. The lack of health literacy in official institutions, health care personnel and recipients alike led to little use of official information. Instead, most participants relied on social media, social contacts and international media, through which a lot of contradictive and negative information about the vaccine was spread. The decision to get vaccinated or not was a process fraught with insecurities about the effectiveness and side effects of the vaccine, which was balanced against wishing to be protected and contributing to the battle against COVID-19. Suggestions for information dissemination improvements from the participants were to produce multilingual information and to increase the use of transmission through social interaction with trusted persons and platforms. ConclusionsAn inadequately adapted information outreach prevented some members of the society from making fact-based decisions about getting vaccinated. Several suggestions for improving dissemination were brought forth that can be tested in future communication strategies. Author summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSPeople with an immigrant background have consistently displayed a lower vaccination uptake than the general population. This study investigated aspects of health literacy, information access and vaccination hesitancy in foreign-born individuals in Sweden. What did the researchers do and find?Few participants accessed official information about the COVID-19 vaccine, mainly because of poorly adapted information outreach, language barriers and not knowing Swedish institutions. Instead, they turned to a multitude of other sources from which conflicting and inaccurate information was spread, lowering their confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine. What do these findings mean?In the case of national emergencies, important public health information does not reach everyone equally, obstructing the possibility for some to make an information-based decision on how to protect their health.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and severe adverse events (&#34;Severe AEs&#34;) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo explore the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

Material and methodsIn October 2021, a nationwide structured telephone survey (disproportionate stratified sampling) was conducted regarding COVID-19 pandemics, including vaccination experience. To examine associations between inoculation and other characteristics, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were applied.

ResultsOut of 3 126 adults, 68% reported complete vaccination and 21% only the first dose, while 11% remained unvaccinated. Non-vaccination was associated with being younger, male, without a partner, low socioeconomic level, and no previous diagnosis of hypertension, obesity or diabetes. Furthermore, the non-vaccinated were less likely to have tested for COVID-19, and more likely to consider COVID-19 as low severe and not real compared with the vaccinated. Using logistic regression models: place of residence, marital status, educational level, age, BMI, testing for COVID-19, and the perception of COVID-19 (severe and real) were significant predictors of non-vaccination. The predominant reasons for not getting vaccinated were: 63% &#34;external barriers&#34; (e.g., not being able to attend an appointment), and 37% &#34;internal motives&#34; (e.g., &#34;vaccine does not work&#34;).

ConclusionsThe causes of non-vaccination against COVID-19 are related to both social and geographical determinants. Addressing external barriers is necessary in order to promote equity in vaccination. Reviewing the results in the context of earlier studies on the willingness to vaccinate, the gap between intention and vaccination is notable.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause  allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination.

HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories.
C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global  caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries.
C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century.
C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionActive and passive surveillance studies have found that a greater proportion of females report adverse events (AE) following receipt of either the COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccine compared to males. We sought to determine the intersection of biological sex and sociocultural gender differences in prospective active reporting of vaccine outcomes, which remains poorly characterized.

MethodsThis cohort study enrolled Johns Hopkins Health System healthcare workers (HCWs) who were recruited from the annual fall 2019-2022 influenza vaccine and the fall 2022 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine campaigns. Vaccine recipients were enrolled the day of vaccination and AE surveys were administered two days post-vaccination (DPV) for bivalent COVID-19 and Influenza vaccine recipients. Data were collected regarding the presence of a series of solicited local and systemic AEs. Open-ended answers about participants experiences with AEs also were collected for the COVID-19 vaccine recipients.

ResultsFemales were more likely to report local AEs after influenza (OR=2.28, p=0.001) or COVID-19 (OR=2.57, p=0.008) vaccination compared to males, regardless of age or race. Males and females had comparable probabilities of reporting systemic AEs after influenza (OR=1.18, p=0.552) or COVID-19 (OR=0.96, p=0.907) vaccination. Exogenous hormones from birth control use did not impact the rates of reported AEs following COVID-19 vaccination among reproductive-aged female HCWs. Women reported more interruptions in their daily routine following COVID-19 vaccination than men and were more likely to seek out self-treatment. More women than men scheduled their COVID-19 vaccination before their days off in anticipation of AEs.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for sex- and gender-inclusive policies to inform more effective occupational health vaccination strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential disruption of AEs on occupational responsibilities following mandated vaccination for healthcare workers and to more fully characterize the post-vaccination behavioral differences between men and women.

KEY MESSAGEO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS{Rightarrow} Among diversely aged adults 18-64 years, females report more AEs to vaccines, including the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, than males.
{Rightarrow}Vaccine AEs play a role in shaping vaccine hesitancy and uptake.
{Rightarrow}Vaccine uptake related to influenza and COVID-19 are higher among men than women.
{Rightarrow}Research that addresses both the sex and gender disparities of vaccine outcomes and behaviors is lacking.


What this study adds{Rightarrow} This prospective active reporting study uses both quantitative and qualitative survey data to examine sex and gender differences in AEs following influenza or COVID-19 vaccination among a cohort of reproductive-aged healthcare workers.


How this study might affect research, practice, or policy{Rightarrow} Sex and gender differences in AEs and perceptions relating to vaccination should drive the development of more equitable and effective vaccine strategies and policies in occupational health settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Under the aegis of the National Infectious Diseases Act, the virus transitioned from a Category 2 menace to Category 5, analogous to seasonal influenza. The current study has investigated the protracted immune responses of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. One year subsequent to the systematically implemented SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign among HCWs, humoral and cellular immune responses were sustained at levels as high as or higher than those immediately following the 3rd booster vaccination. Persisting immunity has highlighted the resilience and lasting memory exhibited in HCW defense against the virus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLower rates of COVID-19 vaccination have been observed in individuals with an immigrant background, yet if this relates to barriers to obtaining reliable information is unknown. This exploratory interview study investigated health literacy and information access as determinants for vaccination hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine among foreign-born individuals in Sweden.

Methods and findingsWe used purposive sampling to recruit foreign-born adults from low- and middle-income countries and health guides and doulas who were assigned to spread COVID-19 related information in immigrant-dense urban areas. Data were collected using semi-structured focus group interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to systematic text condensation.

Ten participants were included who were gainfully employed as health guides/doulas, or in other jobs, full-time students, or housewives. Four main themes emerged: 1) Limited health literacy, 2) Consequences of not using official Swedish information, 3) Decision-making on COVID-19 vaccination, and 4) Suggestions to improve information dissemination effectiveness. The lack of health literacy in official institutions, health care personnel and recipients alike led to little use of official information. Instead, most participants relied on social media, social contacts and international media, through which a lot of contradictive and negative information about the vaccine was spread. The decision to get vaccinated or not was a process fraught with insecurities about the effectiveness and side effects of the vaccine, which was balanced against wishing to be protected and contributing to the battle against COVID-19. Suggestions for information dissemination improvements from the participants were to produce multilingual information and to increase the use of transmission through social interaction with trusted persons and platforms.

ConclusionsAn inadequately adapted information outreach prevented some members of the society from making fact-based decisions about getting vaccinated. Several suggestions for improving dissemination were brought forth that can be tested in future communication strategies.

Author summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSPeople with an immigrant background have consistently displayed a lower vaccination uptake than the general population. This study investigated aspects of health literacy, information access and vaccination hesitancy in foreign-born individuals in Sweden.

What did the researchers do and find?Few participants accessed official information about the COVID-19 vaccine, mainly because of poorly adapted information outreach, language barriers and not knowing Swedish institutions. Instead, they turned to a multitude of other sources from which conflicting and inaccurate information was spread, lowering their confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine.

What do these findings mean?In the case of national emergencies, important public health information does not reach everyone equally, obstructing the possibility for some to make an information-based decision on how to protect their health.</p>
