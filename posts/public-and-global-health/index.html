To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths. ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths. ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death. FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council. Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022? Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow). Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.\nSelf-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality\nAuthors: Yuan, H.; Plekhanova, T.; Walmsley, R.; Reynolds, A. C.; Maddison, K. J.; Bucan, M.; Gehrman, P.; Rowlands, A.; Ray, D. W.; Bennett, D.; McVeigh, J.; Straker, L.; Eastwood, P.; Kyle, S. D.; Doherty, A.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292251\nBackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (\u003c6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77). InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included \"wearable\", \"actigraphy\" or \"accelerometer\" in combination with \"sleep stage\" or \"sleep classification\", and \"polysomnography\". Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n\u003c100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes. Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies. Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.\nNew tuberculosis vaccines in India: Modelling the potential health and economic impacts of adolescent/adult vaccination with M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination\nAuthors: Clark, R. A.; Weerasuriya, C. K.; Portnoy, A.; Mukandavire, C.; Quaife, M.; Bakker, R.; Scarponi, D.; Harris, R. C.; Rade, K.; Mattoo, S. K.; Tumu, D.; Menzies, N. A.; White, R. G.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.24.23286406\nBackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies. MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives. ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease. ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.\nChatGPT sits the DFPH exam: large language model performance and potential to support public health learning\nAuthors: Davies, N. P.; Wilson, R.; Winder, M. S.; Tunster, S. J.; McVicar, K.; Thakrar, S. T.; Williams, J.; Reid, A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.23291894\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence-based large language models, like ChatGPT, have been rapidly assessed for both risks and potential in health-related assessment and learning. However, their application in public health professional exams have not yet been studied. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in part of the Faculty of Public Healths Diplomat exam (DFPH). MethodsChatGPT was provided with a bank of 119 publicly available DFPH question parts from past papers. Its performance was assessed by two active DFPH examiners. The degree of insight and level of understanding apparently displayed by ChatGPT was also assessed. ResultsChatGPT passed 3 of 4 papers, surpassing the current pass rate. It performed best on questions relating to research methods. Its answers had a high floor. Examiners identified ChatGPT answers with 73.6% accuracy and human answers with 28.6% accuracy. ChatGPT provided a mean of 3.6 unique insights per question and appeared to demonstrate a required level of learning on 71.4% of occasions. ConclusionsLarge language models have rapidly increasing potential as a learning tool in public health education. However, their factual fallibility and the difficulty of distinguishing their responses from that of humans pose potential threats to teaching and learning.\nDefining indicators for disease burden, clinical outcomes, policies, and barriers to health services for migrant populations in the Middle East and North African region: a suite of systematic reviews\nAuthors: Seedat, F.; Evangelidou, S.; Abdellatifi, M.; Bouaddi, O.; Cuxart-Graell, A.; Edries, H.; Elafef, E.; Maatoug, T.; Ouahchi, A.; Pampiri, L. M.; Deal, A.; Arias, S.; Assarag, B.; Hassouni, K.; Chaoui, A.; Chemao-Elfihri, W.; Hilali, M.; Ibrahimi, A.; Khalis, M.; Mansour, W.; Mtiraoui, A.; Wickramage, K.; Zenner, D.; Requena-Mendez, A.; Hargreaves, S.; MENA Migrant Health Working Group, Score: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.23292496\nIntroductionThe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is characterised by high and complex migration flows, yet little is known about the health of migrant populations, their levels of under-immunisation, and access to healthcare provision. Data are needed to support regional elimination and control targets for key diseases and the design and delivery of programmes to improve health outcomes in these groups. This protocol describes a suite of seven systematic reviews that aim to identify, appraise, and synthesise the available evidence on burden and clinical indicators, policies, and barriers related to these mobile populations in the region. Methods and analysisSeven systematic reviews will cover two questions to explore: 1) the burden and clinical outcomes and 2) the policies, uptake, and the barriers for the following seven disease areas in migrants in the MENA region: tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis B and C, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, diabetes, mental health, maternal and neonatal health, and vaccine-preventable diseases. We will search electronic databases for studies in any language (year 2000 to 2023), reference-check relevant publications, and cross-check included studies with experts. We will search for grey literature by hand searching key databases and websites (including regional organisations and MoH websites) for country-specific guidelines and talking to our network of experts for local and regional reports and key datasets. We will assess the studies and policies for their quality using appropriate tools. We will meta-analyse the data if they are of sufficient volume and similarity by disease outcome. Where meta-analysis is not possible and where data are on policy, we will narratively synthesise the evidence using summary tables, figures, and text. Ethics and disseminationWe anticipate disseminating the findings through peer-reviewed publications, conferences, and other formats relevant to all stakeholders. We are following PRISMA guidelines and protocols will be registered on PROSPERO. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYO_LIExplicit, transparent, and recommended systematic review methodology. C_LIO_LIComprehensive search strategy with no language restrictions and extensive grey literature searching online and through expert government and non-government support. C_LIO_LIInternational team with multidisciplinary expertise on migrant health, diseases, policymaking, and methodology. C_LIO_LIData prior to the year 2000 will be excluded. C_LIO_LIMeta-analysis may not be possible due to heterogeneity, and we anticipate that most of the data will come from grey literature. C_LI\nA unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk\nAuthors: Jermy, B.; Läll, K.; Wolford, B.

R.; Neale, B.; Hveem, K.; Mägi, R.; Palotie, A.; Heyne, H.; Mars, N.; Ganna, A.; Ripatti, S.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291186\nPolygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects.

As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but higher than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.\nThe role and influence of perceived experts in an anti-vaccine misinformation community\nAuthors: Harris, M. J.; Murtfeldt, R.; Wang, S.; Mordecai, E. A.; West, J. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292568\nThe role of perceived experts (i.e., medical professionals and biomedical scientists) as potential anti-vaccine influencers has not been characterized systematically. We describe the prevalence and importance of anti-vaccine perceived experts by constructing a coengagement network based on a Twitter data set containing over 4.2 million posts from April 2021. The coengagement network primarily broke into two large communities that differed in their stance toward COVID-19 vaccines, and misinformation was predominantly shared by the anti-vaccine community. Perceived experts had a sizable presence within the anti-vaccine community and shared academic sources at higher rates compared to others in that community. Perceived experts occupied important network positions as central anti-vaccine nodes and bridges between the anti- and pro-vaccine communities. Perceived experts received significantly more engagements than other individuals within the anti- and pro-vaccine communities and there was no significant difference in the influence boost for perceived experts between the two communities. Interventions designed to reduce the impact of perceived experts in spreading anti-vaccine misinformation may be warranted.\nPrevalence of Post COVID-19 Condition among healthcare workers: self-reported online survey in four African countries\nAuthors: Elnadi, H.; Al-Mustapha, A.

M.; Radwan, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291768\nThe impact of Post COVID-19 Condition is ongoing despite the WHO declaration that the pandemic has ended. In this study, we explore the prevalence of PCC among healthcare workers (HCWs) in four African Countries and its influence on their professional performance. This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers from four African countries (Cameroon, Egypt, Nigeria, and Somalia) between the 20th of December 2021 to 12th of January 2022. We determined the prevalence of PCC based on the WHO case definition and assessed variables associated with a higher prevalence of PCC in these countries using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 706 HCWs from four African countries were included in this survey. Most of the HCWs were aged between 18-34 years (75.8%, n=535). Our findings showed that 19.5% (n=138) of the HCWs had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, 8.4% (n=59) were symptomatic for COVID-19 but tested negative or were never tested. Two-thirds of the HCWs (66.4%, n=469) have received a COVID-19 vaccine and 80.6% (n=378) of those vaccinated had been fully vaccinated. The self-reported awareness rate of PCC among the HCWs was 16.1% (n=114/706) whereas the awareness rate of PCC among COVID-19-positive HCWs was 55.3 % (n=109/197). The prevalence of PCC among HCWs was 58.8% (n=116). These changes include the self-reported symptoms of PCC which included headache (58.4%, n=115), fatigue (58.8%, n=116), and muscle pain (39.6%, n=78). Similarly, 30% (n=59) and 20.8% (n=41) of the HCWs reported the loss of smell and loss of taste long after their COVID-19 infection, respectively. Some HCWs (42%, n=83) believed that their work performance has been affected by their ongoing symptoms of PCC. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of PCC among the vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs (p \u003e 0.05). Of the socio-demographic variables, age (older HCWs between 45-54 years; OR:1.7; 95% CI: 1.06, 10.59; p = 0.001) and location (Egypt; OR:14.57; 95% CI: 2.62, 26.76; p = 0.001) were more likely to have experienced PCC than other age groups and countries respectively. The study revealed low prevalence of PCC among the surveyed HCC. In addition, it observed the need for adequate medical and psychological support to HCWs with PCC, improve their COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and conduct mass advocacy campaigns on PCC.

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThe emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities.

ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths.

ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths.

ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses.

Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death.

FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council.

Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022?

Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow).

Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes.

MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality.

FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (&lt;6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77).

InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included &#34;wearable&#34;, &#34;actigraphy&#34; or &#34;accelerometer&#34; in combination with &#34;sleep stage&#34; or &#34;sleep classification&#34;, and &#34;polysomnography&#34;. Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n&lt;100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes.

Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies.

MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives.

ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease.

ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundArtificial intelligence-based large language models, like ChatGPT, have been rapidly assessed for both risks and potential in health-related assessment and learning. However, their application in public health professional exams have not yet been studied. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in part of the Faculty of Public Healths Diplomat exam (DFPH).

MethodsChatGPT was provided with a bank of 119 publicly available DFPH question parts from past papers. Its performance was assessed by two active DFPH examiners. The degree of insight and level of understanding apparently displayed by ChatGPT was also assessed.

ResultsChatGPT passed 3 of 4 papers, surpassing the current pass rate. It performed best on questions relating to research methods. Its answers had a high floor. Examiners identified ChatGPT answers with 73.6% accuracy and human answers with 28.6% accuracy. ChatGPT provided a mean of 3.6 unique insights per question and appeared to demonstrate a required level of learning on 71.4% of occasions.

ConclusionsLarge language models have rapidly increasing potential as a learning tool in public health education. However, their factual fallibility and the difficulty of distinguishing their responses from that of humans pose potential threats to teaching and learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is characterised by high and complex migration flows, yet little is known about the health of migrant populations, their levels of under-immunisation, and access to healthcare provision. Data are needed to support regional elimination and control targets for key diseases and the design and delivery of programmes to improve health outcomes in these groups. This protocol describes a suite of seven systematic reviews that aim to identify, appraise, and synthesise the available evidence on burden and clinical indicators, policies, and barriers related to these mobile populations in the region.

Methods and analysisSeven systematic reviews will cover two questions to explore: 1) the burden and clinical outcomes and 2) the policies, uptake, and the barriers for the following seven disease areas in migrants in the MENA region: tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis B and C, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, diabetes, mental health, maternal and neonatal health, and vaccine-preventable diseases. We will search electronic databases for studies in any language (year 2000 to 2023), reference-check relevant publications, and cross-check included studies with experts. We will search for grey literature by hand searching key databases and websites (including regional organisations and MoH websites) for country-specific guidelines and talking to our network of experts for local and regional reports and key datasets. We will assess the studies and policies for their quality using appropriate tools. We will meta-analyse the data if they are of sufficient volume and similarity by disease outcome. Where meta-analysis is not possible and where data are on policy, we will narratively synthesise the evidence using summary tables, figures, and text.

Ethics and disseminationWe anticipate disseminating the findings through peer-reviewed publications, conferences, and other formats relevant to all stakeholders. We are following PRISMA guidelines and protocols will be registered on PROSPERO.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYO_LIExplicit, transparent, and recommended systematic review methodology.

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but higher than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of perceived experts (i.e., medical professionals and biomedical scientists) as potential anti-vaccine influencers has not been characterized systematically. We describe the prevalence and importance of anti-vaccine perceived experts by constructing a coengagement network based on a Twitter data set containing over 4.2 million posts from April 2021. The coengagement network primarily broke into two large communities that differed in their stance toward COVID-19 vaccines, and misinformation was predominantly shared by the anti-vaccine community. Perceived experts had a sizable presence within the anti-vaccine community and shared academic sources at higher rates compared to others in that community. Perceived experts occupied important network positions as central anti-vaccine nodes and bridges between the anti- and pro-vaccine communities. Perceived experts received significantly more engagements than other individuals within the anti- and pro-vaccine communities and there was no significant difference in the influence boost for perceived experts between the two communities. Interventions designed to reduce the impact of perceived experts in spreading anti-vaccine misinformation may be warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of Post COVID-19 Condition is ongoing despite the WHO declaration that the pandemic has ended. In this study, we explore the prevalence of PCC among healthcare workers (HCWs) in four African Countries and its influence on their professional performance. This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers from four African countries (Cameroon, Egypt, Nigeria, and Somalia) between the 20th of December 2021 to 12th of January 2022. We determined the prevalence of PCC based on the WHO case definition and assessed variables associated with a higher prevalence of PCC in these countries using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 706 HCWs from four African countries were included in this survey. Most of the HCWs were aged between 18-34 years (75.8%, n=535). Our findings showed that 19.5% (n=138) of the HCWs had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, 8.4% (n=59) were symptomatic for COVID-19 but tested negative or were never tested. Two-thirds of the HCWs (66.4%, n=469) have received a COVID-19 vaccine and 80.6% (n=378) of those vaccinated had been fully vaccinated. The self-reported awareness rate of PCC among the HCWs was 16.1% (n=114/706) whereas the awareness rate of PCC among COVID-19-positive HCWs was 55.3 % (n=109/197). The prevalence of PCC among HCWs was 58.8% (n=116). These changes include the self-reported symptoms of PCC which included headache (58.4%, n=115), fatigue (58.8%, n=116), and muscle pain (39.6%, n=78). Similarly, 30% (n=59) and 20.8% (n=41) of the HCWs reported the loss of smell and loss of taste long after their COVID-19 infection, respectively. Some HCWs (42%, n=83) believed that their work performance has been affected by their ongoing symptoms of PCC. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of PCC among the vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs (p &gt; 0.05). Of the socio-demographic variables, age (older HCWs between 45-54 years; OR:1.7; 95% CI: 1.06, 10.59; p = 0.001) and location (Egypt; OR:14.57; 95% CI: 2.62, 26.76; p = 0.001) were more likely to have experienced PCC than other age groups and countries respectively. The study revealed low prevalence of PCC among the surveyed HCC. In addition, it observed the need for adequate medical and psychological support to HCWs with PCC, improve their COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and conduct mass advocacy campaigns on PCC.
