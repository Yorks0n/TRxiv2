This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid. MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration. FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources. ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma. Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.\nThe Mortality Burden from COVID in Low-Income Settings: Evidence from Verbal Autopsies in India\nAuthors: Malani, A.; Zhao, W.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300728\nMeasuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.\nReduction in State Specific Influenza Mortality During the COVID Pandemic and Its Association with Political Preference\nAuthors: Morris, R. D.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39). ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.\nProfiling health and socioeconomic disadvantage in the northern Adelaide Local Health Network population.\nAuthors: Shoubridge, C.; Maddison, J.; Lynch, J.; Boyd, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300748\nObjectiveWe describe aspects of social disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region, demonstrate how living with disadvantage impacts health outcomes to understand how the local health network can better serve this disadvantaged community. DesignUsing large scale, population-based data from the 2021 census we captured a snapshot of the disadvantage and health status of the community within the northern Adelaide region compared to the central and southern regions of Adelaide and other Australian capital cities. ResultsNorthern Adelaide is a region of greater relative disadvantage, as shown by both the low Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage score (993) compared to the national average (1000) and scores above the national average for the central and southern Adelaide regions. Social determinants that contribute to this relative disadvantage include the proportion of people with no or limited education (26%) and those living on constrained income sources (e.g. unemployment benefits / aged pension, 10% and 72%, respectively). The northern Adelaide region has higher burdens of long-term health conditions including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and lung diseases. The comparatively high prevalence of obesity (37%) for people in the north of Adelaide were associated with low numbers of people with adequate fruit intake (48%) and the higher proportion of people who currently smoke (16%) and who undertake low or no levels of exercise (73%). ConclusionsSocial disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region is associated with poorer health outcomes and higher levels of health risk behaviour compared to the less disadvantaged central and southern regions of Adelaide. Adapting health care to recognise this association may help improve the health of people living with disadvantage. Summary boxO_LIThe known. The northern Adelaide region is a disadvantaged community. C_LIO_LIThe new. Here we demonstrate the types and prevalence of social determinants of health and the health status of the northern Adelaide community compared to other regions of greater Adelaide and other greater Australian capital cities. C_LIO_LIThe implications. This snapshot of the local social determinants of health sets a context for the health system to respond to the well-being needs of a community that are driven by some of the most adverse social determinants in Australia.

Z.; Mpinganjira, S.; Sibongile Nkosi, D.; Chido Konono, K. C.; Ngigi, M.; Ongolo-Zogo, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300795\nIntroductionThe emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has affected countries worldwide, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC has experienced four waves of COVID-19, each associated with a new variant of the virus. To control the spread of the virus, the government of the DRC implemented various measures, including vaccination. The country developed a COVID-19 vaccine deployment plan, targeting high-risk groups, and launched a vaccination campaign in April 2021. This study aims to comprehensively assess the COVID-19 vaccination program in the DRC during its first year of implementation, including progress, coverage, types of vaccines administered, and a comparison with other neighboring countries. MethodsThis study was an analysis of the COVID-19 vaccination data during its first year of implementation in DRC. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the Ministry of Health and the WHO, and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study received clearance and used de-identified and aggregated data. ResultsOut of the 26 provinces in the country, only 15 began immunization activities with varying levels of coverage, ranging from 0.02% to 6.91%. The number of functional vaccination sites remained patchy across the country. By March 2022, 5.7% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose, with 1.03% fully vaccinated. In most provinces, men were more compliant with vaccination than women. More than half of the vaccinated individuals preferred the Janssen vaccine. Compared to neighboring countries, the DRC has lagged behind in its vaccination efforts, having administered only 1.1 million of doses received (8%) and has vaccinated only 2% of its population with at least one dose, the lowest among the countries analyzed. ConclusionDespite the challenges faced in the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination, DRC has made significant progress in vaccinating its population. The slow progress highlights the need for continued investment in health systems. These insights can inform future Covid-19 vaccination campaigns in DRC and other low-income countries.\nRacial Differences in the Relationship Between Blood Pressure and Cognitive Decline\nAuthors: Oliver, M. D.; Morrison, C.; El-Hulu, S.; Harvey, M.; Barnes, L. L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300811\nBackgroundCognition may be influenced by health-related factors such as blood pressure (BP). However, variations in BP may differentially affect cognition as a function of race. This study investigates the relationship between normal, high, and variable BP and cognitive decline in older Black and White adults. Methods2284 participants (1139 Blacks, 1145 Whites, MAge=73.4, SD=6.6) from 3 harmonized cohorts of older adults from the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center, were divided into 3 groups (normal, high, variable) based on systolic BP mean and standard deviation. Cognitive scores were computed from multiple assessments in 5 domains (i.e., episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability). Performance across 19 tests were averaged to create a measure of global cognition. Linear mixed-effects models examined racial differences between BP and cognitive change over an average of 6.7 years. ResultsWhite adults with high or variable BP had faster rates of decline in global cognition compared to Black adults. White adults with high BP declined faster in perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory compared to Black adults with high BP, whereas White adults with variable BP had faster rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to Black adults with variable BP. No racial differences were observed in individuals with normal BP. ConclusionsWhite older adults with elevated or fluctuating BP show faster rates of cognitive decline compared to older Black adults. Findings highlight the complex interplay between BP and cognitive health, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to address racial disparities in cognitive well-being.\nTrends in long-term vaping among adults in England, 2013-2023\nAuthors: Jackson, S. E.; Tattan-Birch, H.; Shahab, L.; Brown, J.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300376\nObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping among adults in England. DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey. SettingEngland. Participants179,725 adults ([\u0026ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023. Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod). ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively). ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults. What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people. C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use. C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping. C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day. C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimLong Covid can be a stigmatising condition, particularly in people who are disadvantaged within society. This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid.

MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration.

FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources.

ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma.

Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Measuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39).

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveWe describe aspects of social disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region, demonstrate how living with disadvantage impacts health outcomes to understand how the local health network can better serve this disadvantaged community.

DesignUsing large scale, population-based data from the 2021 census we captured a snapshot of the disadvantage and health status of the community within the northern Adelaide region compared to the central and southern regions of Adelaide and other Australian capital cities.

ResultsNorthern Adelaide is a region of greater relative disadvantage, as shown by both the low Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage score (993) compared to the national average (1000) and scores above the national average for the central and southern Adelaide regions. Social determinants that contribute to this relative disadvantage include the proportion of people with no or limited education (26%) and those living on constrained income sources (e.g. unemployment benefits / aged pension, 10% and 72%, respectively). The northern Adelaide region has higher burdens of long-term health conditions including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and lung diseases. The comparatively high prevalence of obesity (37%) for people in the north of Adelaide were associated with low numbers of people with adequate fruit intake (48%) and the higher proportion of people who currently smoke (16%) and who undertake low or no levels of exercise (73%).

ConclusionsSocial disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region is associated with poorer health outcomes and higher levels of health risk behaviour compared to the less disadvantaged central and southern regions of Adelaide. Adapting health care to recognise this association may help improve the health of people living with disadvantage.

Summary boxO_LIThe known. The northern Adelaide region is a disadvantaged community.
C_LIO_LIThe new. Here we demonstrate the types and prevalence of social determinants of health and the health status of the northern Adelaide community compared to other regions of greater Adelaide and other greater Australian capital cities.
C_LIO_LIThe implications. This snapshot of the local social determinants of health sets a context for the health system to respond to the well-being needs of a community that are driven by some of the most adverse social determinants in Australia.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has affected countries worldwide, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC has experienced four waves of COVID-19, each associated with a new variant of the virus. To control the spread of the virus, the government of the DRC implemented various measures, including vaccination. The country developed a COVID-19 vaccine deployment plan, targeting high-risk groups, and launched a vaccination campaign in April 2021. This study aims to comprehensively assess the COVID-19 vaccination program in the DRC during its first year of implementation, including progress, coverage, types of vaccines administered, and a comparison with other neighboring countries.

MethodsThis study was an analysis of the COVID-19 vaccination data during its first year of implementation in DRC. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the Ministry of Health and the WHO, and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study received clearance and used de-identified and aggregated data.

ResultsOut of the 26 provinces in the country, only 15 began immunization activities with varying levels of coverage, ranging from 0.02% to 6.91%. The number of functional vaccination sites remained patchy across the country. By March 2022, 5.7% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose, with 1.03% fully vaccinated. In most provinces, men were more compliant with vaccination than women. More than half of the vaccinated individuals preferred the Janssen vaccine. Compared to neighboring countries, the DRC has lagged behind in its vaccination efforts, having administered only 1.1 million of doses received (8%) and has vaccinated only 2% of its population with at least one dose, the lowest among the countries analyzed.

ConclusionDespite the challenges faced in the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination, DRC has made significant progress in vaccinating its population. The slow progress highlights the need for continued investment in health systems. These insights can inform future Covid-19 vaccination campaigns in DRC and other low-income countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognition may be influenced by health-related factors such as blood pressure (BP). However, variations in BP may differentially affect cognition as a function of race. This study investigates the relationship between normal, high, and variable BP and cognitive decline in older Black and White adults.

Methods2284 participants (1139 Blacks, 1145 Whites, MAge=73.4, SD=6.6) from 3 harmonized cohorts of older adults from the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center, were divided into 3 groups (normal, high, variable) based on systolic BP mean and standard deviation. Cognitive scores were computed from multiple assessments in 5 domains (i.e., episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability). Performance across 19 tests were averaged to create a measure of global cognition. Linear mixed-effects models examined racial differences between BP and cognitive change over an average of 6.7 years.

ResultsWhite adults with high or variable BP had faster rates of decline in global cognition compared to Black adults. White adults with high BP declined faster in perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory compared to Black adults with high BP, whereas White adults with variable BP had faster rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to Black adults with variable BP. No racial differences were observed in individuals with normal BP.

ConclusionsWhite older adults with elevated or fluctuating BP show faster rates of cognitive decline compared to older Black adults. Findings highlight the complex interplay between BP and cognitive health, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to address racial disparities in cognitive well-being.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping among adults in England.

DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey.

SettingEngland.

Participants179,725 adults ([&amp;ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023.

Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod).

ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively).

ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults.

What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people.
C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use.
C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping.
C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day.
C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.
