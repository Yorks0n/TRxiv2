We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [\u0026ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.\nOverall Health Effects of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Hoffmann, S. S.; Nielsen, S.; Thysen, S. M.; Duriseti, R.; Benn, C. S.\nScore: 1288.8, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23298573\nImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects; this is not assessed within the current regulatory framework. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs, overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=3.03 (1.29-7.09)[0.6% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted. Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections. MeaningThe results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.\nAsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections tend to occur less frequently in developed nations\nAuthors: Chowdhury, S.; Tiwari, A.; James, A.; Chatterjee, B.; Dixit, N. M.\nScore: 31.2, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299954\nUnlike severe infections, asymptomatic infections occur independently of healthcare access and reflect the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. What determines their prevalence,{psi} , and its variation across nations is unknown. We conducted a systematic review of serosurveys performed on samples representative of national populations before vaccination and the emergence of variants. The studies that met our selection criteria together sampled 4,58,489 individuals and yielded estimates of{psi} in 33 nations. Using random-effects modeling, we found the pooled global{psi} to be 45.3% (95% CI: 33.6%-57.5%).{psi} varied widely across nations (range: 6%-96%; I2=99.7%), highlighting the enormous underlying variation in the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Performing meta-regression with national-level metrics, we found that the human development index (HDI) was negatively correlated with{psi} (p=10-13; R2=65.5%). More developed nations thus experienced less frequent asymptomatic infections on average. These findings have implications for unraveling the origins of asymptomatic infections and for future pandemic preparedness.\nRetrospective analysis of Covid-19 hospitalization modelling scenarios which guided policy response in France\nAuthors: Langevin, M.; Starck, T.\nScore: 23.5, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300086\nEpidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

L.; Staub, K.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299432\nWe follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among \u003e30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.\nA 17-month longitudinal environmental sampling study carried out on public transport vehicles operating in England during the COVID-19 pandemic identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA contamination\nAuthors: Aranega Bou, P.; Pottage, T.; Fenwick, A.; D'Costa, W.; Brown, N. F.; Yaxley, N.; King, M.-F.; Parker, S. T.; Miller, D.; Lopez-Garcia, M.; Noakes, C. J.; Moore, G.; Bennett, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300219\nAims: To monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA contamination in vehicles operating in England during the pandemic, to better understand transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on public transport. Methods and Results: We collected 1,314 surface samples between December 2020 and April 2022 on trains and buses managed by five different transport operators. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was investigated through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on 197 (15%) of the 1,314 surfaces sampled, including seat head rests, handholds, and air extract grilles, but the levels of RNA recovered on those samples (median value of 23.4, inter-quartile range: 14.3-35.4, N gene copies per extraction) made the presence of infectious virus at the time of sampling extremely unlikely. However, detection rates varied over time with peaks broadly coinciding with times of high community transmission, suggesting that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 when travelling on public transport could create opportunities for transmission. Conclusion: During the pandemic, and as in other public spaces, low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found on surfaces associated with public transport. Impact statement: The results of this study will inform modelling approaches and the implementation of mitigation strategies to minimise the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses in public transport.\nEco-anxiety among Children and Young People: Systematic Review of Social, Political, and Geographical determinants\nAuthors: Kankawale, S.; Niedzwiedz, C. L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300198\nBackgroundEco-anxiety, the experience of challenging emotions relating to environmental issues, such as climate change, and the threats they present, is of increasing global public health concern. Although responses to eco-anxiety can be positive and motivational, experienced to a severe extent, they may contribute to depressive and anxiety disorders, exacerbate existing mental health conditions and negatively impact general wellbeing. Children and young people may be more susceptible to higher levels eco-anxiety, but the factors which contribute to eco-anxiety are not well-understood. This systematic review explored the social, political and geographical factors influencing eco-anxiety among children and young people. MethodsA comprehensive search of articles published between 2017-2023 was conducted on using EBSCOhost for APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Child Development \u0026 Adolescent Studies, CINAHL, EconLit, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX, with additional individual searches conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and PsyArxiv. The quality of included articles was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist. The findings were summarised using a narrative synthesis approach. ResultsEighteen studies were included in the synthesis after screening 2,588 articles. Determinants in three major categories were identified: social (including age, gender, socioeconomic position, education, news and social media), political (climate activism, government inaction and sense of betrayal), and geographical factors (direct exposure to climate change-related events and country/region). Nine studies were cross-sectional, five were qualitative, three were mixed methods and one was longitudinal. Most studies were from high-income countries, particularly Australia, New Zealand and Norway. Studies were of variable methodological quality, using different measurement approaches to eco-anxiety and most surveys were conducted online using non-representative samples. ConclusionEco-anxiety is influenced by a range of social, political, and geographical factors. Governments and the mass media could play an important role in preventing eco-anxiety becoming of clinical concern. Given the lack of high-quality studies in this area, further research is essential to better understand the determinants of eco-anxiety across cultures to help minimize its impact on mental health and wellbeing and ensure it is channeled positively.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization.

MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [&amp;ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress.

ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6).

InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects; this is not assessed within the current regulatory framework.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. Two authors independently screened 1199 studies, six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (SAEs) and severe adverse events (AEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine and placebo cohorts were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was SAEs, overall and infectious. Secondary outcomes were severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 mRNA vaccine recipients and 8,011 placebo recipients). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=3.03 (1.29-7.09)[0.6% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.

Question, Findings, and MeaningO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the overall health effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 trials, mRNA vaccine vs. placebo was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events. The mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of severe adverse events in children aged 5 years and older. In children younger than 5 years, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections.

MeaningThe results suggest that mRNA vaccines are associated with increased risk of severe adverse events and increased risk of LRTI. Given the low risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children, it is not clear that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in children outweigh the harms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unlike severe infections, asymptomatic infections occur independently of healthcare access and reflect the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. What determines their prevalence,{psi} , and its variation across nations is unknown. We conducted a systematic review of serosurveys performed on samples representative of national populations before vaccination and the emergence of variants. The studies that met our selection criteria together sampled 4,58,489 individuals and yielded estimates of{psi} in 33 nations. Using random-effects modeling, we found the pooled global{psi} to be 45.3% (95% CI: 33.6%-57.5%).{psi} varied widely across nations (range: 6%-96%; I2=99.7%), highlighting the enormous underlying variation in the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Performing meta-regression with national-level metrics, we found that the human development index (HDI) was negatively correlated with{psi} (p=10-13; R2=65.5%). More developed nations thus experienced less frequent asymptomatic infections on average. These findings have implications for unraveling the origins of asymptomatic infections and for future pandemic preparedness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological modelling has played a key role in proposing, analyzing and justifying non-pharmaceuticals interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, evaluations of models ability to accurately anticipate the evolution of the disease remain scarce. Thus, robust, systematic, and pre-specified evaluation criteria are needed to assess the relevance of modelling scenarios that guided policy response during the pandemic. We conduct a retrospective assessment of modelling reports which guided policy response in France from April 2020 to April 2022. After systematically verifying the scenarios hypotheses (e.g., exclusion of no-lockdown scenarios when a lockdown was effectively in place), we find that epidemiological models were (a) uncertain, (b) unaccurate, and (c) biased towards an overestimation of predicted COVID-19 related hospitalizations. In more than half of the reports, reality is below or equal to even the best-case scenario. To our knowledge, this is the only national systematic retrospective assessment of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios; such an approach should be reproduced in other countries whenever possible.

        <p class="abstract">We follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among &gt;30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims: To monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA contamination in vehicles operating in England during the pandemic, to better understand transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on public transport. Methods and Results: We collected 1,314 surface samples between December 2020 and April 2022 on trains and buses managed by five different transport operators. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was investigated through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on 197 (15%) of the 1,314 surfaces sampled, including seat head rests, handholds, and air extract grilles, but the levels of RNA recovered on those samples (median value of 23.4, inter-quartile range: 14.3-35.4, N gene copies per extraction) made the presence of infectious virus at the time of sampling extremely unlikely. However, detection rates varied over time with peaks broadly coinciding with times of high community transmission, suggesting that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 when travelling on public transport could create opportunities for transmission. Conclusion: During the pandemic, and as in other public spaces, low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found on surfaces associated with public transport. Impact statement: The results of this study will inform modelling approaches and the implementation of mitigation strategies to minimise the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses in public transport.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEco-anxiety, the experience of challenging emotions relating to environmental issues, such as climate change, and the threats they present, is of increasing global public health concern. Although responses to eco-anxiety can be positive and motivational, experienced to a severe extent, they may contribute to depressive and anxiety disorders, exacerbate existing mental health conditions and negatively impact general wellbeing. Children and young people may be more susceptible to higher levels eco-anxiety, but the factors which contribute to eco-anxiety are not well-understood. This systematic review explored the social, political and geographical factors influencing eco-anxiety among children and young people.

MethodsA comprehensive search of articles published between 2017-2023 was conducted on using EBSCOhost for APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Child Development &amp; Adolescent Studies, CINAHL, EconLit, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX, with additional individual searches conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and PsyArxiv. The quality of included articles was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist. The findings were summarised using a narrative synthesis approach.

ResultsEighteen studies were included in the synthesis after screening 2,588 articles. Determinants in three major categories were identified: social (including age, gender, socioeconomic position, education, news and social media), political (climate activism, government inaction and sense of betrayal), and geographical factors (direct exposure to climate change-related events and country/region). Nine studies were cross-sectional, five were qualitative, three were mixed methods and one was longitudinal. Most studies were from high-income countries, particularly Australia, New Zealand and Norway. Studies were of variable methodological quality, using different measurement approaches to eco-anxiety and most surveys were conducted online using non-representative samples.

ConclusionEco-anxiety is influenced by a range of social, political, and geographical factors. Governments and the mass media could play an important role in preventing eco-anxiety becoming of clinical concern. Given the lack of high-quality studies in this area, further research is essential to better understand the determinants of eco-anxiety across cultures to help minimize its impact on mental health and wellbeing and ensure it is channeled positively.</p>
