ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR. ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization. ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [\u0026ge;]7 days after the second dose. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.\nPreparedness in practice: An outbreak science approach to studying public health emergency response\nAuthors: Moore, M.; Robertson, H.; Rosado, D.; Graeden, E.; Carlson, C. J.; Katz, R.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291861\nOutbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.\nAssociation of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States, 2022-2023\nAuthors: Packard, S. E.; Susser, E.\nScore: 120.0, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290930\nObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States. MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms \u003e 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity. ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.\nIntention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Benin and Senegal: a structural equation modelling (SEM)\nAuthors: GAYE, I.; Ridde, V.; Avahoundjea, E.; BA, M. F.; DOSSOU, J. p.; Diallo, A. I.; FAYE, A.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292061\nIntroductionVaccination is considered one of the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a small proportion of the population was fully vaccinated in Benin (20.9%) and Senegal (7.6%) by December 2022. This study explores the determinants of intent to vaccinate. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of 865 Beninese and 607 Senegalese aged 18 years and older. Marginal quota sampling by age, gender and region was adopted. Data collection, using a survey instrument based on the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) method, was conducted from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, in Senegal and from March 29 to May 14, 2021, in Benin. The questionnaire used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). The influence of factors was tested using a structural equation model. All analyses were conducted in R. ResultsResults show that a good perception of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen =0.33***; {beta}Ben=0.12***), a positive attitude ({beta}sen=0.22***; {beta}Ben=0.20***), and sensitivity to subjective norms ({beta}sen=0.19***; {beta}Ben=0.32***) positively influence the intention to vaccinate. Low trust in health care providers ({beta}sen=-0.40***; {beta}Ben=-0.36***) amplifies the perceived risk of vaccination ({beta}sen=-0.14***; {beta}Ben=-0.25***), which negatively impacts intention to vaccinate. Perceived vaccine efficacy was affected by perceived risk ({beta}sen=-0.12***; {beta}Ben=-0.05***) of the disease and improved by good apprehension of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen=0.60***; {beta}Ben=0.13***). Aspects related to behavioral control, vaccine information seeking, efficacy, or fairness did not appear as correlates of vaccine intention (P\u003e0.05). ConclusionBeninese and Senegalese public health authorities could develop additional intervention strategies to improve immunization coverage by considering these influencing factors, the basis of which could be better understood through subsequent qualitative studies.\nA unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk\nAuthors: Jermy, B.; Läll, K.; Wolford, B.

R.; Neale, B.; Hveem, K.; Mägi, R.; Palotie, A.; Heyne, H.; Mars, N.; Ganna, A.; Ripatti, S.\nScore: 35.4, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291186\nPolygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.\nSOCIAL MEDIA AS AN INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION TOOL FOR RABIES PREVENTION: AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY\nAuthors: Verma, J.; Agarwal, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291848\nIntroductionRabies is a fatal disease that can be avoided by treating animal bites promptly. Hence, post-exposure prophylaxis is critical. As a result, the National Rabies Control Program was approved under the 12th five-year plan. One of its strategies is to engage in Information, Education and Communication activities. Social media provides an opportunity for the quick and easy dissemination of research but is constrained by a lack of peer review and the risk of misinterpretation. The efficacy of a novel social media-based knowledge dissemination strategy for rabies prevention was tested in this study. MethodsAn experimental study design was followed, wherein 144 preclinical medical students were included in each control and test group. The test group was administered the intervention, which exposed the participants to health education material via social media across a span of 30 days. Participants knowledge, attitude, and practices were observed before and after the study duration. ResultsThere was no significant change in the responses of the control (chi-square statistic = 2.46, p-value = 0.96) and test (chi-square statistic = 1.64, p-value = 0.98) groups across the study duration. A comparison of the change in responses between the two groups revealed an insignificant difference (chi-square statistic = 1.29, p-value = 0.73). ConclusionSocial media is an ineffective strategy for improvements in health literacy over a short duration. Such strategies need further validation for longer durations. Moreover, the effectiveness of the health education material itself needs to be assessed.\nA review of scientific theories used to justify the delivery of school-based mindfulness programmes . A protocol for a scoping review\nAuthors: Abbott, P. A.; Nixon, G.; Stanley, I.; D'Ambruoso, L.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291616\nBackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing. MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team. DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.\nRisk and rates of hospitalisation in young children: a prospective study of a South African birth cohort\nAuthors: Wedderburn, C. J.; Bondar, J.; Lake, M. T.; Nhapi, R.; Barnett, W.; Nicol, M. P.; Goddard, L.; Zar, H. J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23289961\nIntroductionChildren in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality; there is also a growing vulnerable population of children who are HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU). Understanding reasons and risk factors for early-life child hospitalisation will help optimise interventions to improve health outcomes. We investigated hospitalisations from birth to two years in a South African birth cohort. MethodsMother-child pairs in the Drakenstein Child Health Study were followed from birth to two years with active surveillance for hospital admission and investigation of aetiology and outcome. Incidence, duration, cause, and factors associated with child hospitalisation were investigated, and compared between HEU and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children ResultsOf 1136 children (247 HEU; 889 HUU), 314 (28%) children were hospitalised in 430 episodes despite \u003e98% childhood vaccination coverage. The highest hospitalisation rate was from 0-6 months, decreasing thereafter; 20% (84/430) of hospitalisations occurred in neonates at birth. Amongst hospitalisations subsequent to discharge after birth, 83% (288/346) had an infectious cause; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was the most common cause (49%;169/346) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) responsible for 31% of LRTIs; from 0-6 months, RSV-LRTI accounted for 22% (36/164) of all-cause hospitalisations. HIV exposure was a risk factor for hospitalisation in infants (IRR 1.63 [95% CI 1.29-2.05]) and longer hospital admission (p=0.004). Prematurity (HR 2.82 [95% CI 2.28-3.49]), delayed infant vaccinations (1.43 [1.12-1.82]), or raised maternal HIV viral load in HEU infants were risk factors; breastfeeding was protective (0.69 [0.53-0.90]). ConclusionChildren in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation in early life. Infectious causes, especially RSV-LRTI, underly most hospital admissions. HEU children are at particular risk in infancy. Available strategies such as promoting breastfeeding, timely vaccination, and optimising antenatal maternal HIV care should be strengthened. New interventions to prevent RSV may have a large additional impact in reducing hospitalisation. KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe Sustainable Development Goals highlight the need to prevent child morbidity and mortality. However, there are limited recent data on hospitalisation rates and determinants in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including in children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), despite this region having the highest under-5 mortality rate. C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU represent a growing vulnerable population in SSA. C_LI What are the new findings?O_LIEarly-life hospitalisation occurred in 28% of children in our cohort, most frequently in the first 6 months of life, despite high vaccination coverage including the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and excluding paediatric HIV infection. C_LIO_LIInfectious causes represented 83% of hospital admissions after birth; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused most hospitalisations (49%), with RSV accounting for 31% of episodes. In the first 6 months of life RSV-LRTI was responsible for 22% of all-cause hospitalisations and for 41% of LRTI hospitalisations. C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU had higher rates of hospitalisation in infancy through 12 months, compared to HIV-unexposed and uninfected children (HUU), as well as longer hospital stay. C_LIO_LIPrematurity or delayed vaccination were associated with higher risk of hospitalisation; detectable maternal HIV viral load was associated with higher hospitalisation rates in HEU children; breastfeeding was protective against hospitalisation, particularly from gastrointestinal causes. C_LI What do the new findings imply?O_LIYoung children in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation and infectious causes underly most hospital admissions. C_LIO_LIRenewed focus on measures to prevent hospitalisation in young children is needed, including interventions to encourage breastfeeding practices, timely vaccinations, optimal maternal health, and targeting at-risk children including those who are HEU or premature. C_LIO_LINew interventions against RSV-LRTI may substantially reduce hospitalisation in LMICs. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData on mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine effectiveness in children aged 6 months to 5 years are limited.

ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR.

ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization.

ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [&amp;ge;]7 days after the second dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Outbreak response, as a technical and specialized field of practice, is struggling to keep pace with the evolving dynamics of modern public health emergencies. Extensive scholarship across disciplines and epidemics has highlighted the importance of early action, the costs associated with delayed mobilization, the necessity of effective preparedness plans for complex crises, and the growing need for response to operate in spite of both uncertain information and social disruptions. Here, we present and analyze a new dataset of 235 different multisectoral activities that comprise outbreak preparedness and response. We explore the conditions under which these activities are applicable, including different phases of response, different operating circumstances, and different disease etiologies, and find that the core activities required for outbreak response largely apply across etiology and scale, but are more substantial during the early phases of response. To validate this framework with real-world examples, we then examine 279 reports from the WHO Disease Outbreak News (DON), a narrative record of outbreak history through time, and examine which of our activities are reported or implied in these narratives. We find that the core components of response are applicable across the vast majority of biological events, especially as they relate to basic epidemiology, infection prevention, and governance, and that many different kinds of real-world outbreaks require the same core set of responses. These findings point to a nearly-universal set of outbreak response activities that could be directly incorporated into national and international response plans, significantly reducing the risk and impact of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo assess the association of Long COVID with housing insecurity in the United States.

MethodsTo compare the prevalence of 3 binary indicators of housing insecurity between people with Long COVID (symptoms &gt; 3 months) and COVID-19 survivors who dont report long-term symptoms, we used survey-weighted regression models on 203,807 responses from the Household Pulse Survey, a representative cross-sectional survey of US households collected September 2022 - April 2023. Among people with Long COVID, we assessed whether functional impairment, current COVID-19 related symptoms, and symptom impact on day-to- day life were associated with a higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ResultsDuring the study period, 54,446 (27.2%) respondents with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting 3 months or longer, representing an estimated 27 million US adults. People with Long COVID were nearly twice as likely to experience significant difficulty with household expenses (Prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.74-1.96), be behind on housing payments (PR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57-1.99), and face likely eviction or foreclosure (PR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.86). Functional limitation and current symptoms which impact day-to-day life were associated with higher prevalence of housing insecurity.

ConclusionsCompared with COVID-19 survivors who dont experience long-term symptoms, people with Long COVID are more likely to report indicators housing insecurity, particularly those with functional limitations and long-term COVID-19 related symptoms impacting day-to- day life. Policies are needed to support people living with chronic illnesses following SARS- CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccination is considered one of the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a small proportion of the population was fully vaccinated in Benin (20.9%) and Senegal (7.6%) by December 2022. This study explores the determinants of intent to vaccinate.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of 865 Beninese and 607 Senegalese aged 18 years and older. Marginal quota sampling by age, gender and region was adopted. Data collection, using a survey instrument based on the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) method, was conducted from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, in Senegal and from March 29 to May 14, 2021, in Benin. The questionnaire used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). The influence of factors was tested using a structural equation model. All analyses were conducted in R.

ResultsResults show that a good perception of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen =0.33***; {beta}Ben=0.12***), a positive attitude ({beta}sen=0.22***; {beta}Ben=0.20***), and sensitivity to subjective norms ({beta}sen=0.19***; {beta}Ben=0.32***) positively influence the intention to vaccinate. Low trust in health care providers ({beta}sen=-0.40***; {beta}Ben=-0.36***) amplifies the perceived risk of vaccination ({beta}sen=-0.14***; {beta}Ben=-0.25***), which negatively impacts intention to vaccinate. Perceived vaccine efficacy was affected by perceived risk ({beta}sen=-0.12***; {beta}Ben=-0.05***) of the disease and improved by good apprehension of the benefits of vaccination ({beta}sen=0.60***; {beta}Ben=0.13***). Aspects related to behavioral control, vaccine information seeking, efficacy, or fairness did not appear as correlates of vaccine intention (P&gt;0.05).

ConclusionBeninese and Senegalese public health authorities could develop additional intervention strategies to improve immunization coverage by considering these influencing factors, the basis of which could be better understood through subsequent qualitative studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRabies is a fatal disease that can be avoided by treating animal bites promptly. Hence, post-exposure prophylaxis is critical. As a result, the National Rabies Control Program was approved under the 12th five-year plan. One of its strategies is to engage in Information, Education and Communication activities. Social media provides an opportunity for the quick and easy dissemination of research but is constrained by a lack of peer review and the risk of misinterpretation. The efficacy of a novel social media-based knowledge dissemination strategy for rabies prevention was tested in this study.

MethodsAn experimental study design was followed, wherein 144 preclinical medical students were included in each control and test group. The test group was administered the intervention, which exposed the participants to health education material via social media across a span of 30 days. Participants knowledge, attitude, and practices were observed before and after the study duration.

ResultsThere was no significant change in the responses of the control (chi-square statistic = 2.46, p-value = 0.96) and test (chi-square statistic = 1.64, p-value = 0.98) groups across the study duration. A comparison of the change in responses between the two groups revealed an insignificant difference (chi-square statistic = 1.29, p-value = 0.73).

ConclusionSocial media is an ineffective strategy for improvements in health literacy over a short duration. Such strategies need further validation for longer durations. Moreover, the effectiveness of the health education material itself needs to be assessed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing.

MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team.

DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionChildren in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality; there is also a growing vulnerable population of children who are HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU). Understanding reasons and risk factors for early-life child hospitalisation will help optimise interventions to improve health outcomes. We investigated hospitalisations from birth to two years in a South African birth cohort.

MethodsMother-child pairs in the Drakenstein Child Health Study were followed from birth to two years with active surveillance for hospital admission and investigation of aetiology and outcome. Incidence, duration, cause, and factors associated with child hospitalisation were investigated, and compared between HEU and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children

ResultsOf 1136 children (247 HEU; 889 HUU), 314 (28%) children were hospitalised in 430 episodes despite &gt;98% childhood vaccination coverage. The highest hospitalisation rate was from 0-6 months, decreasing thereafter; 20% (84/430) of hospitalisations occurred in neonates at birth. Amongst hospitalisations subsequent to discharge after birth, 83% (288/346) had an infectious cause; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was the most common cause (49%;169/346) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) responsible for 31% of LRTIs; from 0-6 months, RSV-LRTI accounted for 22% (36/164) of all-cause hospitalisations. HIV exposure was a risk factor for hospitalisation in infants (IRR 1.63 [95% CI 1.29-2.05]) and longer hospital admission (p=0.004). Prematurity (HR 2.82 [95% CI 2.28-3.49]), delayed infant vaccinations (1.43 [1.12-1.82]), or raised maternal HIV viral load in HEU infants were risk factors; breastfeeding was protective (0.69 [0.53-0.90]).

ConclusionChildren in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation in early life. Infectious causes, especially RSV-LRTI, underly most hospital admissions. HEU children are at particular risk in infancy. Available strategies such as promoting breastfeeding, timely vaccination, and optimising antenatal maternal HIV care should be strengthened. New interventions to prevent RSV may have a large additional impact in reducing hospitalisation.

KEY QUESTIONSO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe Sustainable Development Goals highlight the need to prevent child morbidity and mortality. However, there are limited recent data on hospitalisation rates and determinants in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including in children who are HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), despite this region having the highest under-5 mortality rate.
C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU represent a growing vulnerable population in SSA.
C_LI

What are the new findings?O_LIEarly-life hospitalisation occurred in 28% of children in our cohort, most frequently in the first 6 months of life, despite high vaccination coverage including the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and excluding paediatric HIV infection.
C_LIO_LIInfectious causes represented 83% of hospital admissions after birth; lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused most hospitalisations (49%), with RSV accounting for 31% of episodes. In the first 6 months of life RSV-LRTI was responsible for 22% of all-cause hospitalisations and for 41% of LRTI hospitalisations.
C_LIO_LIChildren who are HEU had higher rates of hospitalisation in infancy through 12 months, compared to HIV-unexposed and uninfected children (HUU), as well as longer hospital stay.
C_LIO_LIPrematurity or delayed vaccination were associated with higher risk of hospitalisation; detectable maternal HIV viral load was associated with higher hospitalisation rates in HEU children; breastfeeding was protective against hospitalisation, particularly from gastrointestinal causes.
C_LI

What do the new findings imply?O_LIYoung children in SSA continue to experience high rates of hospitalisation and infectious causes underly most hospital admissions.
C_LIO_LIRenewed focus on measures to prevent hospitalisation in young children is needed, including interventions to encourage breastfeeding practices, timely vaccinations, optimal maternal health, and targeting at-risk children including those who are HEU or premature.
C_LIO_LINew interventions against RSV-LRTI may substantially reduce hospitalisation in LMICs.
