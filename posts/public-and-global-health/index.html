  "articleBody": " Mapping geographic and demographic shifts in container breeding mosquito-borne disease transmission suitability in Central and South America in a warming world\nAuthors: Ryan, S. J.; Lippi, C. A.; Stewart-Ibarra, A. M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296495\nThe recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) report brought into sharp relief the potential health impacts of a changing climate across large geographic regions. It also highlighted the gaps in available evidence to support detailed quantitative assessments of health impacts for many regions. In an increasingly urbanizing world, there is a need for additional information about the risk of mosquito-borne diseases from vectors adapted to human water storage behavior. Specifically, a better understanding of the geographic distribution of disease risk under different scenarios of climate warming and human populations shifts. For the Central and South America chapter of the IPCC Working Group II report, regional extractions of published projections of dengue and Zika risk in a changing climate were generated by one of the authors of this study. In that process, the lack of a compendium of available published risk estimates became apparent. This paper responds to that need and extends the scope of the IPCC report results for Central and South America. We present novel geospatial descriptions of risk for transmission for five mosquito-borne disease systems under future projected climate and demographic scenarios, including the potential risk for malaria in the event of the introduction and establishment of a vector of high global concern, Anopheles stephensi . We then present country-level and IPCC geospatial sub-region risk descriptions under baseline and future projected scenarios. By including demographic projections using the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, we capture potential future risk in a way that is transparent and straightforward to compare and replicate. The goal of this paper is to report on these model output data and their availability. From a sub-regional perspective, the largest proportional gains in risk will be seen in the Southwestern South America (SWS) sub-region, comprising much of the southwestern coastline, for which suitability for Aedes aegypti transmitted dengue and Zika risk will see massive increases with warming, putting a large number of people at risk under future scenarios. In contrast, at the country level, the largest projected population risk impacts will be seen in Brazil for both arboviral and potential introduced malaria risk, despite some risks projected to decrease as parts of the country are too hot to sustain transmission risk. This paper provides modeled outputs for future use, in addition to broad summary descriptions at regional and country levels.\nA mixed method study to assess behavioral and social predictors of parent/caregivers intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 disease in an Indian state marked by significant health disparities.\nAuthors: Singh, T.; Kumar, S.; Sinha, S.; Singh, V.\nScore: 4.4, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296592\nBackground: Parents/caregivers are the key decision-makers for childs health care including vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy along with lagging full immunization coverage for childhood vaccination in India, affect child health outcome and will affect covid-19 vaccine uptake in children. It is important to understand behavioral and social factors surrounding childhood COVID-19 vaccination to design appropriate interventions to improve uptake. Methods: A mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative method was undertaken. A cross sectional survey of parents/caregivers of children aged less than 18 years residing in the state was carried out to find the prevalence and predictors of parent/ caregivers intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 disease. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to find facilitating and barrier factors for childhood COVID-19 vaccination. Result: Out of 9904 study participants, 73.4% had intention to vaccinate. Parent/caregivers education and occupation, marital status, family type, family income, co-morbidity and previous COVID-19 infection in family, childhood vaccination under NIS, were found to be significantly associated. The likelihood of intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 disease was greater among parents/caregivers aged 18-29 years (OR=2.631, 95% CI [1.733-3.995], illiterate parents/caregivers (OR=3.037, 95% CI [2.319-3.977], prior COVID-19 infection in family (OR=1.595, 95% CI [1.432-1.821], and childrens prior vaccinations under NIS (OR=1.251, 95% CI [1.218-1.289]. In qualitative part, forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. The majority of intending parents gave vaccine effectiveness, increased immunity, high infection risk, herd immunity, and medical recommendations as reasons. Parents who refused mentioned inadequate data, adverse effects, beliefs, safety, and inconvenience as reasons. Effectiveness, and safety, long-term effects, and the short testing period were among the concerns of hesitant parents. Conclusion: In order to promote COVID-19 vaccination among children, we need to address barriers, facilitators and behavioral determinants of parents/caregivers identified in this study and have targeted strategies for them.\nAssociation of Cognitive Deficits with Sociodemographic Characteristics among Adults with Post-COVID Conditions: Findings from the United States Household Pulse Survey\nAuthors: Wu, D. J.; Liu, N.\nScore: 61.5, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295981\nBackgroundPeople infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States. MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions. ResultsAmong individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states. ConclusionsThe risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.\nSoil surveillance for monitoring soil-transmitted helminth infections: method development and field testing in three countries\nAuthors: Manuel, M.; Amato, H.; Pilotte, N.; Chieng, B.; Siko, J.; Harris, M.; Nadimpalli, M.; Janagaraj, V.; Houngbegnon, P.; Rajendiran, R.; Thamburaj, J.; Kaliappan, S. P.; Sirois, A. R.; Walch, G.; Oswald, W.; Asbjörnsdottir, K. H.; Galagan, S.; Walson, J. L.; Williams, S. A.; Luty, A. J. F.; Njenga, S.; Ibikounle, M.; Ajjampur, S. S. R.; Pickering, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296174\nOne-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting extensive laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in three countries: Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species (including Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and A. ceylanicum). Using matched household soil and stool samples, detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost of sample collection and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations. Synopsis: Limited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.\nEstimating changes in antibiotic consumption with the introduction of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States\nAuthors: Oliveira Roster, K. I.; Grad, Y.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295787\nDoxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.\nThe potential health and economic impacts of new tuberculosis vaccines under varying delivery strategies in Delhi and Gujarat, India: a modelling study\nAuthors: Clark, R. A.; Portnoy, A.; Weerasuriya, C. K.; Sumner, T.; Bakker, R.; Harris, R. C.; Rade, K.; Mattoo, S. K.; Tumu, D.; Menzies, N. A.; White, R. G.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296211\nBackgroundIndia has the largest tuberculosis burden globally, but this burden varies nationwide. All-age tuberculosis prevalence in 2021 ranged from 747/100,000 in Delhi to 137/100,000 in Gujarat. Previous modelling has demonstrated the benefits and costs of introducing novel tuberculosis vaccines in India overall. However, no studies have compared the potential impact of tuberculosis vaccines in regions within India with differing tuberculosis disease and infection prevalence. We used mathematical modelling to investigate how the health and economic impact of two potential tuberculosis vaccines, M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination, could differ in Delhi and Gujarat under varying delivery strategies. MethodsWe applied a compartmental tuberculosis model separately for Delhi (higher disease and infection prevalence) and Gujarat (lower disease and infection prevalence), and projected epidemiological trends to 2050 assuming no new vaccine introduction. We simulated M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios varying target ages and vaccine characteristics. We estimated cumulative cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years averted between 2025-2050 compared to the no-new-vaccine scenario and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to three cost-effectiveness thresholds. ResultsM72/AS01E averted a higher proportion of tuberculosis cases than BCG-revaccination in both regions (Delhi: 16.0% vs 8.3%, Gujarat: 8.5% vs 5.1%) and had higher vaccination costs (Delhi: USD$118 million vs USD$27 million, Gujarat: US$366 million vs US$97 million). M72/AS01E in Delhi could be cost-effective, or even cost-saving, for all modelled vaccine characteristics. M72/AS01E could be cost-effective in Gujarat, unless efficacy was assumed only for those with current infection at vaccination. BCG-revaccination could be cost-effective, or cost-saving, in both regions for all modelled vaccine scenarios. DiscussionM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in Delhi and Gujarat. Differences in impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness between vaccines and regions, were determined partly by differences in disease and infection prevalence, and demography. Age-specific regional estimates of infection prevalence could help to inform delivery strategies for vaccines that may only be effective in people with a particular infection status. Evidence on the mechanism of effect of M72/AS01E and its effectiveness in uninfected individuals, which were important drivers of impact and cost-effectiveness, particularly in Gujarat, are also key to improve estimates of population-level impact.\nAssessing health equity in wastewater monitoring programs: Differences in the demographics and social vulnerability of sewered and unsewered populations across North Carolina\nAuthors: Hu, X. C.; Reckling, S. K.; Keshaviah, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296680\nBackground: Wastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied. Objectives: We conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county. Methods: After intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system, regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring, with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than +/- 5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error). Results: As a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents. Discussion: Our results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.\nPrevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military personnel during the second epidemic wave in Peru\nAuthors: Valladares-Garrido, D.; Dominguez-Troncos, H.; Picon-Reategui, C. K.; Valdiviezo-Morales, C.; Vera-Ponce, V. J.; Failoc-Rojas, V. E.; Pereira-Victorio, C. J.; Leon - Figueroa, D. A.; Valladares-Garrido, M. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296474\nThere is few research in military members that provided protection and security during the COVID-19 crisis. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military members. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 02 and 09, 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region of Lambayeque, Peru. The outcome was fear of COVID-19, measured with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The association with resilience (abbreviated CD-RISC), food insecurity (HFIAS), physical activity (IPAQ-S), eating disorder (EAT-26), and other socio-labor variables were assessed. Of 525 participants, the median age was 22, 95.8% were male, and 19.2% experienced fear of COVID-19. A higher prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was associated with age (PR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), religion (PP=2.05; 95% CI: 1.04-4.05), eating disorder (PR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.99-4.36), and having a relative with mental disorder (PR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.09-4.17). Overweight (PR=0.58; 95% IC: 0.37-0.90) and a high level of resilience (PR=0.63; 95% IC: 0.43-0.93) were associated with a lower prevalence of fear of COVID-19. Two out of ten military personnel were afraid of COVID-19. We recommend special attention to the factors associated with the development of suicide risk in military personnel.\nIntimate partner violence and its correlates in middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-country secondary analysis\nAuthors: Chang, G.; Tucker, J.; Walker, K.; Chu, C.; Miall, N.; Tan, R.; Wu, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296197\nBackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey. MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data. ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p\u003c0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04). ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR6) report brought into sharp relief the potential health impacts of a changing climate across large geographic regions. It also highlighted the gaps in available evidence to support detailed quantitative assessments of health impacts for many regions. In an increasingly urbanizing world, there is a need for additional information about the risk of mosquito-borne diseases from vectors adapted to human water storage behavior. Specifically, a better understanding of the geographic distribution of disease risk under different scenarios of climate warming and human populations shifts. For the Central and South America chapter of the IPCC Working Group II report, regional extractions of published projections of dengue and Zika risk in a changing climate were generated by one of the authors of this study. In that process, the lack of a compendium of available published risk estimates became apparent. This paper responds to that need and extends the scope of the IPCC report results for Central and South America. We present novel geospatial descriptions of risk for transmission for five mosquito-borne disease systems under future projected climate and demographic scenarios, including the potential risk for malaria in the event of the introduction and establishment of a vector of high global concern, Anopheles stephensi . We then present country-level and IPCC geospatial sub-region risk descriptions under baseline and future projected scenarios. By including demographic projections using the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, we capture potential future risk in a way that is transparent and straightforward to compare and replicate. The goal of this paper is to report on these model output data and their availability. From a sub-regional perspective, the largest proportional gains in risk will be seen in the Southwestern South America (SWS) sub-region, comprising much of the southwestern coastline, for which suitability for Aedes aegypti transmitted dengue and Zika risk will see massive increases with warming, putting a large number of people at risk under future scenarios. In contrast, at the country level, the largest projected population risk impacts will be seen in Brazil for both arboviral and potential introduced malaria risk, despite some risks projected to decrease as parts of the country are too hot to sustain transmission risk. This paper provides modeled outputs for future use, in addition to broad summary descriptions at regional and country levels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Parents/caregivers are the key decision-makers for childs health care including vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy along with lagging full immunization coverage for childhood vaccination in India, affect child health outcome and will affect covid-19 vaccine uptake in children. It is important to understand behavioral and social factors surrounding childhood COVID-19 vaccination to design appropriate interventions to improve uptake. Methods: A mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative method was undertaken. A cross sectional survey of parents/caregivers of children aged less than 18 years residing in the state was carried out to find the prevalence and predictors of parent/ caregivers intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 disease. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to find facilitating and barrier factors for childhood COVID-19 vaccination. Result: Out of 9904 study participants, 73.4% had intention to vaccinate. Parent/caregivers education and occupation, marital status, family type, family income, co-morbidity and previous COVID-19 infection in family, childhood vaccination under NIS, were found to be significantly associated. The likelihood of intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 disease was greater among parents/caregivers aged 18-29 years (OR=2.631, 95% CI [1.733-3.995], illiterate parents/caregivers (OR=3.037, 95% CI [2.319-3.977], prior COVID-19 infection in family (OR=1.595, 95% CI [1.432-1.821], and childrens prior vaccinations under NIS (OR=1.251, 95% CI [1.218-1.289]. In qualitative part, forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. The majority of intending parents gave vaccine effectiveness, increased immunity, high infection risk, herd immunity, and medical recommendations as reasons. Parents who refused mentioned inadequate data, adverse effects, beliefs, safety, and inconvenience as reasons. Effectiveness, and safety, long-term effects, and the short testing period were among the concerns of hesitant parents. Conclusion: In order to promote COVID-19 vaccination among children, we need to address barriers, facilitators and behavioral determinants of parents/caregivers identified in this study and have targeted strategies for them.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPeople infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States.

MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions.

ResultsAmong individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states.

ConclusionsThe risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting extensive laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in three countries: Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species (including Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and A. ceylanicum). Using matched household soil and stool samples, detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost of sample collection and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations.

Synopsis: Limited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia has the largest tuberculosis burden globally, but this burden varies nationwide. All-age tuberculosis prevalence in 2021 ranged from 747/100,000 in Delhi to 137/100,000 in Gujarat. Previous modelling has demonstrated the benefits and costs of introducing novel tuberculosis vaccines in India overall. However, no studies have compared the potential impact of tuberculosis vaccines in regions within India with differing tuberculosis disease and infection prevalence. We used mathematical modelling to investigate how the health and economic impact of two potential tuberculosis vaccines, M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination, could differ in Delhi and Gujarat under varying delivery strategies.

MethodsWe applied a compartmental tuberculosis model separately for Delhi (higher disease and infection prevalence) and Gujarat (lower disease and infection prevalence), and projected epidemiological trends to 2050 assuming no new vaccine introduction. We simulated M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios varying target ages and vaccine characteristics. We estimated cumulative cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years averted between 2025-2050 compared to the no-new-vaccine scenario and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to three cost-effectiveness thresholds.

ResultsM72/AS01E averted a higher proportion of tuberculosis cases than BCG-revaccination in both regions (Delhi: 16.0% vs 8.3%, Gujarat: 8.5% vs 5.1%) and had higher vaccination costs (Delhi: USD$118 million vs USD$27 million, Gujarat: US$366 million vs US$97 million). M72/AS01E in Delhi could be cost-effective, or even cost-saving, for all modelled vaccine characteristics. M72/AS01E could be cost-effective in Gujarat, unless efficacy was assumed only for those with current infection at vaccination. BCG-revaccination could be cost-effective, or cost-saving, in both regions for all modelled vaccine scenarios.

DiscussionM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in Delhi and Gujarat. Differences in impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness between vaccines and regions, were determined partly by differences in disease and infection prevalence, and demography. Age-specific regional estimates of infection prevalence could help to inform delivery strategies for vaccines that may only be effective in people with a particular infection status. Evidence on the mechanism of effect of M72/AS01E and its effectiveness in uninfected individuals, which were important drivers of impact and cost-effectiveness, particularly in Gujarat, are also key to improve estimates of population-level impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Wastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied. Objectives: We conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county. Methods: After intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system, regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring, with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than &#43;/- 5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error). Results: As a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents. Discussion: Our results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is few research in military members that provided protection and security during the COVID-19 crisis. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with fear of COVID-19 in military members. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 02 and 09, 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region of Lambayeque, Peru. The outcome was fear of COVID-19, measured with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The association with resilience (abbreviated CD-RISC), food insecurity (HFIAS), physical activity (IPAQ-S), eating disorder (EAT-26), and other socio-labor variables were assessed. Of 525 participants, the median age was 22, 95.8% were male, and 19.2% experienced fear of COVID-19. A higher prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was associated with age (PR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), religion (PP=2.05; 95% CI: 1.04-4.05), eating disorder (PR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.99-4.36), and having a relative with mental disorder (PR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.09-4.17). Overweight (PR=0.58; 95% IC: 0.37-0.90) and a high level of resilience (PR=0.63; 95% IC: 0.43-0.93) were associated with a lower prevalence of fear of COVID-19. Two out of ten military personnel were afraid of COVID-19. We recommend special attention to the factors associated with the development of suicide risk in military personnel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey.

MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data.

ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p&lt;0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04).

ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.</p>
