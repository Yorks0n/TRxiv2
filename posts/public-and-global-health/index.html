MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nEast-West mortality disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic widen the historical longevity divide in Europe.\nAuthors: Shkolnikov, V. M.; Timonin, S.; Jdanov, D.; Islam, N.; Leon, D. A.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298275\nFor over half a century, life expectancy in Eastern European (former communist) countries has been appreciably lower than in Western Europe, although this difference has been narrowing since 2000. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these differences. The pandemic reversed the recent convergence and widened the gap to levels observed more than two decades ago (7.9 years for males and 4.9 for females in 2021). Moreover, the trajectory of excess mortality in the pandemic differed between East and West, with the first major peaks in Eastern Europe occurring on average six months after the first peaks seen in Western countries. Despite this, the East suffered greater losses in life expectancy, especially in 2021. This was due to larger relative mortality increases in the East rather than greater frailty of the Eastern European populations as indexed by higher pre-pandemic mortality levels. East-West differences in life expectancy losses in 2021 were substantially explained by COVID-19 vaccination, which together with trust in government accounted for half the gap. We conclude that the East-West differences in life expectancy losses are associated with structural and psychosocial traits that have their roots in the communist era. This includes differences in the connectivity of populations (which drives the differences in timing), as well as profound contrasts in levels of trust in science, authorities, and their capacity to enforce lockdowns and other regulatory measures (driving the huge differences in excess mortality from autumn 2020 onwards).\nEffectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the period January 2021 until May 2022: A systematic literature review\nAuthors: Vardavas, C. I.; Nikitara, K.; Aslanoglou, K.; Marou, V.; Plyta, Z.; Phalkey, R.; Leonardi Bee, J.; Condell, O.; Lamb, F.; Suk, J. E.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298350\nObjectivesIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. DesignWe searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator. Main outcome measuresOutcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively. Results49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive. ConclusionsThis systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs. What is already known on this topicPrior to this study, it was recognised that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hygiene measures, face mask usage, travel restrictions, social distancing, and contact tracing were implemented worldwide. The scientific community has been assessing the effectiveness of these NPIs in mitigating the pandemics impact on public health and the economy. What this study addsThis systematic review contributes by presenting updated and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of NPIs as a means of mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission, using both real-world evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. The study affirms that the timely application of NPIs, including the use of face masks, stay-at-home orders, restrictions on mass gatherings, and school closures, substantially reduced COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It underscores the significance of employing multiple NPIs in tandem for heightened effectiveness within future respiratory pandemics. The review emphasises the necessity for ongoing assessment of NPI efficacy, taking into account factors such as public compliance, vaccination rates, and the prevalence of virus variants. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe findings of this study carry various implications. Firstly, they inform policymakers about the critical importance of promptly implementing NPIs and employing them in combination to manage respiratory pandemics. Secondly, the results underscore the enduring relevance of NPIs even as pandemic vaccination campaigns progress. Thirdly, the study highlights the need for standardized methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Lastly, this review can guide future public health strategies by offering valuable insights into the impact of different interventions on pandemic control.\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S. L.; Howerton, E.; Contamin, L.; Smith, C. P.; Carcelen, E. C.; Yan, K.; Bents, S. J.; Espino, J.; Levander, J.; Reich, N. G.; Lemaitre, J. C.; Sato, K.; McKee, C. D.; Hill, A.

A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; H\nScore: 42.4, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nImportations of SARS-CoV-2 lineages decline after nonpharmaceutical interventions in phylogeographic analyses\nAuthors: Goliaei, S.; Foroughmand-Araabi, M.-H.; Roddy, A.; Weber, A.; Oeversti, S.; Kuehnert, D.; McHardy, A. C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298337\nThe onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic marked a period of substantial challenges as the virus and its variants rapidly spread, placing enormous strain on both society and healthcare systems. Prior to the widespread availability of vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as reducing contacts, antigenic testing, or travel restrictions were the primary means of reducing viral transmission and case numbers, and quantifying the success of these measures is therefore key for future pandemic preparedness. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in systematic surveillance, we studied lineage importations for the third, pandemic wave in Germany, employing a large-scale Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis coupled to a longitudinal assessment of lineage importation dynamics over multiple sampling strategies. We evaluated the effect of twelve major nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on lineage importations and dissemination within the country. All NPIs were followed by reduced lineage importations, with the most substantial decreases seen for the provision of free rapid tests, the strengthening of regulations on mask-wearing in public transport and stores, as well as on internal movements and gatherings. Most SARS-CoV-2 lineages first appeared in the three states with the largest populations and most cases, and from there spread within the country. Importations began to rise before and peaked shortly after the Christmas holidays. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data revealed the substantial effects of free rapid tests and obligatory medical/surgical mask-wearing, suggesting these as key for pandemic preparedness, given their relatively few, negative socioeconomic effects. The approach quantifies the relationships between environmental factors at the host population level to viral lineage dissemination from genomic surveillance data, facilitating similar analyses of rapidly evolving pathogens in the future.\nA Systematic Review of the Attitude, Beliefs, and Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine in the Western and Eastern Hemisphere.\nAuthors: Chander, S.; Kumari, R.; Luhana, S.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298274\nBackgroundThe availability of an effective vaccine does not equate to its use; its effectiveness primarily depends on vaccine acceptance by the targeted population. Despite the rapid development and widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity is yet to be achieved, with vaccine hesitancy as a major barrier. This study sought to systematically assess the beliefs, attitudes, and acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, including factors contributing to vaccination hesitancy in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. MethodsA comprehensive search of articles was conducted through Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to May 2023 using the PRISMA guidelines. ResultsOur search yielded 1154, of which 21 were eligible for inclusion. The rate of willingness or intention to vaccinate varied with the geographic region, from 12% in the USA to 93.9% in China. Four studies from the Western and two from Eastern regions reported a low acceptance rate (defined as \u003c50%): USA (12%), Spain (48.3%), Switzerland (38.6%), Europe (multi-national, 31%), Nepal (38.3%), and Oman (43%). Overall, vaccine acceptance was low-to-moderate in the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in both Eastern and Western hemispheres except for China which reported high acceptance (defined as \u003e75%) among the general population and HCWs. Demographic characteristics (female, younger age, and higher education) and non-demographic factors (knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and its development, history of influenza vaccination, perceived susceptibility or severity of infection, and the belief that vaccines are effective in controlling the pandemic were associate with high acceptance rates or intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, mistrust of the vaccine, its safety and effectiveness, disinformation or poor awareness of the vaccine, side effects concerns, belief in natural immunity, previous adverse experience with the vaccines, and distrust in the information sources about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with vaccination hesitancy. ConclusionFor better acceptance, COVID-19 vaccination campaign strategies should be modeled based on regional political, economic, and social contexts. HighlightsO_LIThe willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines was low-to-moderate in both hemispheres. C_LIO_LIHealthcare workers were as willing to vaccinate as the general population. C_LIO_LIVaccine hesitancy was associated with demographic and vaccine-specific factors.

The proposed Childrens Food Advertising Act (Kinder-Lebensmittel-Werbegesetz or KLWG) in Germany aims to regulate such marketing by using an adapted version of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe Nutrient Profile Model (WHO NPM). Since the first announcement of the proposed new legislation in February 2023, several revisions to the proposed law have been made. In the present study, we evaluate the reach and public health implications of the planned laws latest draft proposed in June 2023, updating a previously published analysis of the initial proposal. MethodsOur analysis is based on a dataset from the open-source online database Open Food Facts, comprising 660 food products randomly selected from the German market. We assigned these products to the 22 food and beverage categories covered the WHO NPM. We then applied the nutrient and ingredient thresholds of the the June 2023 version of the KLWG to this sample to assess the share of products permitted for marketing to children under the proposed legislation. ResultsApplying the adjustments from the June 2023 KLWG version increased the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children in three product categories, namely plant-based milks (from 70% to 73%), yogurt and cream (from 13% to 73%) and fresh and frozen meat, fish and eggs (from 93% to 100%). Overall, this raised the median share of products across all 22 product categories permitted for marketing to children from 38% to 55%, with an interquartile range of 11%-73%. ConclusionOur previous study found the use of the WHO NPM, as part of the KLWG, to be feasible in the German context and suggested additional threshold adjustments. The latest draft of the KLWG from June 2023 incorporated several of these, substantially increasing the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children. This analysis provides an updated perspective on the evolving debate and its implications for public health.\nPhysical complaints and their relationships to esports activities among Japanese esports players: A cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Monma, T.; Matsui, T.; Koyama, S.; Ueno, H.; Kagesawa, J.; Oba, C.; Nakamura, K.; Takagi, H.; Takeda, F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298495\nIn the evolving landscape of electronic sports (esports), where economic and social expectations are soaring, a critical concern has emerged in physical complaints among esports players. However, empirical insights into these complaints' prevalence and influencing factors are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of physical complaints and their association with esports activities among Japanese esports players. A web-based cross-sectional survey encompassing 175 esports players from both professional and amateur teams in Japan was conducted. The analysis focused on 79 male participants (average age: 21.6 {+/-} 5.6 years) with complete responses. The survey items included the esports factors (the device mainly used, the duration of esports titles played primarily, hours of esports activities per day on weekdays and holidays, and the distance between the screen and the face during esports activities) and physical complaints (headache, neck pain, stiff or sore shoulders, wrist pain, finger pain, lower back pain, and eye fatigue). A total of 49.4% reported stiff or sore shoulders, 48.1% faced eye fatigue, and 30.4% had headaches. Professionals exhibited a significantly higher likelihood of neck, wrist, and lower back pain and eye fatigue than amateurs. Age-adjusted logistic regression analysis uncovered that using mainly mobile devices and being closer to the screen and face during esports activities were significantly associated with neck pain, stiff or sore shoulders, lower back pain, and eye fatigue. These results suggest that poor posture caused by using mobile devices and being closer to the screen during esports activities was related to various physical complaints.\nCommunication attributes modify the anxiety risk associated with social media addiction: evidence from a prospective diary method study\nAuthors: Weng, C. A.; Bulgin, J.; Diaz, S.; Zhang, J.; Tan, R.; Li, L.; Armstrong-Hough, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.30.22282943\nBackground: Social media use in younger people has shown mixed associations with mental health. We hypothesized that communication types during social media use might alter the relationship between social media dependence and anxiety. We aimed to identify how four dimensions of communication influence the link between social media addiction (SMA) and anxiety. Methods: We recruited undergraduate students aged 18-26 to participate in daily surveys over two weeks using a diary method. Participants self-reported daily social media use, SMA measures, anxiety symptoms, and four dimensions of communication: Consumption, Broadness, Online Exclusivity, and Parasociality. Lagged logistic regression models with generalized estimation equations (GEE) evaluated the influence of daily SMA and communication type on ensuing anxiety symptoms. Findings: Out of 79 participants, 1009 daily records were analyzed. SMA positively correlated with anxiety (Kendall rank correlation coef. = 0.30). Interaction analysis indicated that levels of parasociality and consumption moderated the association between SMA components and anxiety outcomes. In young adults with high levels of consumption or parasociality, a 1-standard-deviation rise in the social conflict component of SMA led to an 11%-13% increase in next-day anxiety scores. This association was absent for those with low to moderate communication levels of parasociality and consumption. Interpretation: Elevated levels of passive consumption and one-sided interactions amplify the anxiety risk associated with social media dependence. Further longitudinal evidence can elucidate the connections between communication types, social media exposure, and anxiety, guiding the development of a model for healthy social media use.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized.

MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience.

ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For over half a century, life expectancy in Eastern European (former communist) countries has been appreciably lower than in Western Europe, although this difference has been narrowing since 2000. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these differences. The pandemic reversed the recent convergence and widened the gap to levels observed more than two decades ago (7.9 years for males and 4.9 for females in 2021). Moreover, the trajectory of excess mortality in the pandemic differed between East and West, with the first major peaks in Eastern Europe occurring on average six months after the first peaks seen in Western countries. Despite this, the East suffered greater losses in life expectancy, especially in 2021. This was due to larger relative mortality increases in the East rather than greater frailty of the Eastern European populations as indexed by higher pre-pandemic mortality levels. East-West differences in life expectancy losses in 2021 were substantially explained by COVID-19 vaccination, which together with trust in government accounted for half the gap. We conclude that the East-West differences in life expectancy losses are associated with structural and psychosocial traits that have their roots in the communist era. This includes differences in the connectivity of populations (which drives the differences in timing), as well as profound contrasts in levels of trust in science, authorities, and their capacity to enforce lockdowns and other regulatory measures (driving the huge differences in excess mortality from autumn 2020 onwards).</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies.

DesignWe searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator.

Main outcome measuresOutcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively.

Results49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive.

ConclusionsThis systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs.

What is already known on this topicPrior to this study, it was recognised that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hygiene measures, face mask usage, travel restrictions, social distancing, and contact tracing were implemented worldwide. The scientific community has been assessing the effectiveness of these NPIs in mitigating the pandemics impact on public health and the economy.

What this study addsThis systematic review contributes by presenting updated and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of NPIs as a means of mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission, using both real-world evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. The study affirms that the timely application of NPIs, including the use of face masks, stay-at-home orders, restrictions on mass gatherings, and school closures, substantially reduced COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It underscores the significance of employing multiple NPIs in tandem for heightened effectiveness within future respiratory pandemics. The review emphasises the necessity for ongoing assessment of NPI efficacy, taking into account factors such as public compliance, vaccination rates, and the prevalence of virus variants.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe findings of this study carry various implications. Firstly, they inform policymakers about the critical importance of promptly implementing NPIs and employing them in combination to manage respiratory pandemics. Secondly, the results underscore the enduring relevance of NPIs even as pandemic vaccination campaigns progress. Thirdly, the study highlights the need for standardized methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Lastly, this review can guide future public health strategies by offering valuable insights into the impact of different interventions on pandemic control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic marked a period of substantial challenges as the virus and its variants rapidly spread, placing enormous strain on both society and healthcare systems. Prior to the widespread availability of vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as reducing contacts, antigenic testing, or travel restrictions were the primary means of reducing viral transmission and case numbers, and quantifying the success of these measures is therefore key for future pandemic preparedness. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in systematic surveillance, we studied lineage importations for the third, pandemic wave in Germany, employing a large-scale Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis coupled to a longitudinal assessment of lineage importation dynamics over multiple sampling strategies. We evaluated the effect of twelve major nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on lineage importations and dissemination within the country. All NPIs were followed by reduced lineage importations, with the most substantial decreases seen for the provision of free rapid tests, the strengthening of regulations on mask-wearing in public transport and stores, as well as on internal movements and gatherings. Most SARS-CoV-2 lineages first appeared in the three states with the largest populations and most cases, and from there spread within the country. Importations began to rise before and peaked shortly after the Christmas holidays. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data revealed the substantial effects of free rapid tests and obligatory medical/surgical mask-wearing, suggesting these as key for pandemic preparedness, given their relatively few, negative socioeconomic effects. The approach quantifies the relationships between environmental factors at the host population level to viral lineage dissemination from genomic surveillance data, facilitating similar analyses of rapidly evolving pathogens in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe availability of an effective vaccine does not equate to its use; its effectiveness primarily depends on vaccine acceptance by the targeted population. Despite the rapid development and widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity is yet to be achieved, with vaccine hesitancy as a major barrier. This study sought to systematically assess the beliefs, attitudes, and acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, including factors contributing to vaccination hesitancy in the Eastern and Western hemispheres.

MethodsA comprehensive search of articles was conducted through Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to May 2023 using the PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsOur search yielded 1154, of which 21 were eligible for inclusion. The rate of willingness or intention to vaccinate varied with the geographic region, from 12% in the USA to 93.9% in China. Four studies from the Western and two from Eastern regions reported a low acceptance rate (defined as &lt;50%): USA (12%), Spain (48.3%), Switzerland (38.6%), Europe (multi-national, 31%), Nepal (38.3%), and Oman (43%). Overall, vaccine acceptance was low-to-moderate in the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in both Eastern and Western hemispheres except for China which reported high acceptance (defined as &gt;75%) among the general population and HCWs. Demographic characteristics (female, younger age, and higher education) and non-demographic factors (knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and its development, history of influenza vaccination, perceived susceptibility or severity of infection, and the belief that vaccines are effective in controlling the pandemic were associate with high acceptance rates or intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, mistrust of the vaccine, its safety and effectiveness, disinformation or poor awareness of the vaccine, side effects concerns, belief in natural immunity, previous adverse experience with the vaccines, and distrust in the information sources about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with vaccination hesitancy.

ConclusionFor better acceptance, COVID-19 vaccination campaign strategies should be modeled based on regional political, economic, and social contexts.

HighlightsO_LIThe willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines was low-to-moderate in both hemispheres.
C_LIO_LIHealthcare workers were as willing to vaccinate as the general population.
C_LIO_LIVaccine hesitancy was associated with demographic and vaccine-specific factors.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAdvertising of unhealthy foods to children is a key public health concern as exposure to such advertising has been shown to adversely affect childrens food preferences, choices, purchases and intake. The proposed Childrens Food Advertising Act (Kinder-Lebensmittel-Werbegesetz or KLWG) in Germany aims to regulate such marketing by using an adapted version of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe Nutrient Profile Model (WHO NPM). Since the first announcement of the proposed new legislation in February 2023, several revisions to the proposed law have been made. In the present study, we evaluate the reach and public health implications of the planned laws latest draft proposed in June 2023, updating a previously published analysis of the initial proposal.

MethodsOur analysis is based on a dataset from the open-source online database Open Food Facts, comprising 660 food products randomly selected from the German market. We assigned these products to the 22 food and beverage categories covered the WHO NPM. We then applied the nutrient and ingredient thresholds of the the June 2023 version of the KLWG to this sample to assess the share of products permitted for marketing to children under the proposed legislation.

ResultsApplying the adjustments from the June 2023 KLWG version increased the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children in three product categories, namely plant-based milks (from 70% to 73%), yogurt and cream (from 13% to 73%) and fresh and frozen meat, fish and eggs (from 93% to 100%). Overall, this raised the median share of products across all 22 product categories permitted for marketing to children from 38% to 55%, with an interquartile range of 11%-73%.

ConclusionOur previous study found the use of the WHO NPM, as part of the KLWG, to be feasible in the German context and suggested additional threshold adjustments. The latest draft of the KLWG from June 2023 incorporated several of these, substantially increasing the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children. This analysis provides an updated perspective on the evolving debate and its implications for public health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the evolving landscape of electronic sports (esports), where economic and social expectations are soaring, a critical concern has emerged in physical complaints among esports players. However, empirical insights into these complaints&#39; prevalence and influencing factors are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of physical complaints and their association with esports activities among Japanese esports players. A web-based cross-sectional survey encompassing 175 esports players from both professional and amateur teams in Japan was conducted. The analysis focused on 79 male participants (average age: 21.6 {&#43;/-} 5.6 years) with complete responses. The survey items included the esports factors (the device mainly used, the duration of esports titles played primarily, hours of esports activities per day on weekdays and holidays, and the distance between the screen and the face during esports activities) and physical complaints (headache, neck pain, stiff or sore shoulders, wrist pain, finger pain, lower back pain, and eye fatigue). A total of 49.4% reported stiff or sore shoulders, 48.1% faced eye fatigue, and 30.4% had headaches. Professionals exhibited a significantly higher likelihood of neck, wrist, and lower back pain and eye fatigue than amateurs. Age-adjusted logistic regression analysis uncovered that using mainly mobile devices and being closer to the screen and face during esports activities were significantly associated with neck pain, stiff or sore shoulders, lower back pain, and eye fatigue. These results suggest that poor posture caused by using mobile devices and being closer to the screen during esports activities was related to various physical complaints.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Social media use in younger people has shown mixed associations with mental health. We hypothesized that communication types during social media use might alter the relationship between social media dependence and anxiety. We aimed to identify how four dimensions of communication influence the link between social media addiction (SMA) and anxiety. Methods: We recruited undergraduate students aged 18-26 to participate in daily surveys over two weeks using a diary method. Participants self-reported daily social media use, SMA measures, anxiety symptoms, and four dimensions of communication: Consumption, Broadness, Online Exclusivity, and Parasociality. Lagged logistic regression models with generalized estimation equations (GEE) evaluated the influence of daily SMA and communication type on ensuing anxiety symptoms. Findings: Out of 79 participants, 1009 daily records were analyzed. SMA positively correlated with anxiety (Kendall rank correlation coef. = 0.30). Interaction analysis indicated that levels of parasociality and consumption moderated the association between SMA components and anxiety outcomes. In young adults with high levels of consumption or parasociality, a 1-standard-deviation rise in the social conflict component of SMA led to an 11%-13% increase in next-day anxiety scores. This association was absent for those with low to moderate communication levels of parasociality and consumption. Interpretation: Elevated levels of passive consumption and one-sided interactions amplify the anxiety risk associated with social media dependence. Further longitudinal evidence can elucidate the connections between communication types, social media exposure, and anxiety, guiding the development of a model for healthy social media use.</p>
