J.; Liu, N.\nScore: 59.5, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295981\nBackgroundPeople infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States. MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions. ResultsAmong individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states. ConclusionsThe risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.\nResearch ethics review during the COVID-19 pandemic An international study\nAuthors: Salamanca-Buentello, F.; Katz, R.; Silva, D. S.; Upshur, R. E. G.; Smith, M. J.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23296056\nResearch ethics review committees (ERCs) worldwide faced daunting challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a need to balance rapid turnaround with rigorous evaluation of high-risk research protocols in the context of considerable uncertainty. This study explored the experiences and performance of ERCs during the pandemic. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, global online survey of chairs (or their delegates) of ERCs who were involved in the review of COVID-19-related research protocols after March 2020. The survey ran from October 2022 to February 2023 and consisted of 50 items, with opportunities for open text responses. Two hundred and three participants [130 from high-income countries (HICs) and 73 from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)] completed our survey. Respondents came from diverse entities and organizations from 48 countries (19 HICs and 29 LMICs) in all World Health Organization regions. Responses show little of the increased global funding for COVID-19 research was allotted to the operation of ERCs. Few ERCs had pre-existing internal policies to address operation during public health emergencies, but almost half used existing guidelines. Most ERCs modified existing procedures or designed and implemented new ones but had not evaluated the success of these changes. Participants overwhelmingly endorsed permanently implementing several of them. Few ERCs added new members but non-member experts were consulted; quorum was generally achieved. Collaboration among ERCs was infrequent, but reviews conducted by external ERCs were recognized and validated. Review volume increased during the pandemic, with COVID-19-related studies being prioritized. Most protocol reviews were reported as taking less than three weeks. One-third of respondents reported external pressure on their ERCs from different stakeholders to approve or reject specific COVID-19-related protocols. ERC members faced significant challenges to keep their committees functioning during the pandemic. Our findings can inform ERC approaches towards future public health emergencies. To our knowledge, this is the first international, COVID-19-related study of its kind.\nThe potential health and economic impacts of new tuberculosis vaccines under varying delivery strategies in Delhi and Gujarat, India: a modelling study\nAuthors: Clark, R. A.; Portnoy, A.; Weerasuriya, C. K.; Sumner, T.; Bakker, R.; Harris, R. C.; Rade, K.; Mattoo, S. K.; Tumu, D.; Menzies, N. A.; White, R. G.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296211\nBackgroundIndia has the largest tuberculosis burden globally, but this burden varies nationwide. All-age tuberculosis prevalence in 2021 ranged from 747/100,000 in Delhi to 137/100,000 in Gujarat. Previous modelling has demonstrated the benefits and costs of introducing novel tuberculosis vaccines in India overall. However, no studies have compared the potential impact of tuberculosis vaccines in regions within India with differing tuberculosis disease and infection prevalence. We used mathematical modelling to investigate how the health and economic impact of two potential tuberculosis vaccines, M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination, could differ in Delhi and Gujarat under varying delivery strategies. MethodsWe applied a compartmental tuberculosis model separately for Delhi (higher disease and infection prevalence) and Gujarat (lower disease and infection prevalence), and projected epidemiological trends to 2050 assuming no new vaccine introduction. We simulated M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios varying target ages and vaccine characteristics. We estimated cumulative cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years averted between 2025-2050 compared to the no-new-vaccine scenario and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to three cost-effectiveness thresholds. ResultsM72/AS01E averted a higher proportion of tuberculosis cases than BCG-revaccination in both regions (Delhi: 16.0% vs 8.3%, Gujarat: 8.5% vs 5.1%) and had higher vaccination costs (Delhi: USD$118 million vs USD$27 million, Gujarat: US$366 million vs US$97 million). M72/AS01E in Delhi could be cost-effective, or even cost-saving, for all modelled vaccine characteristics. M72/AS01E could be cost-effective in Gujarat, unless efficacy was assumed only for those with current infection at vaccination. BCG-revaccination could be cost-effective, or cost-saving, in both regions for all modelled vaccine scenarios. DiscussionM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in Delhi and Gujarat. Differences in impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness between vaccines and regions, were determined partly by differences in disease and infection prevalence, and demography. Age-specific regional estimates of infection prevalence could help to inform delivery strategies for vaccines that may only be effective in people with a particular infection status. Evidence on the mechanism of effect of M72/AS01E and its effectiveness in uninfected individuals, which were important drivers of impact and cost-effectiveness, particularly in Gujarat, are also key to improve estimates of population-level impact.\nMeasuring and increasing rates of self-isolation in the context of infectious diseases: A systematic review with narrative synthesis\nAuthors: Smith, L. E.; Martin, A. F.; Brooks, S. K.; Davies, R.; Stein, M.; Amlot, R.; Marteau, T. M.; Rubin, G. J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296339\nBackground: Self-isolation was used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and will likely be used in future infectious disease outbreaks. Method: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA and SWiM guidelines. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and grey literature sources were searched (1 January 2020 to 13 December 2022) using terms related to COVID-19, isolation, and adherence. Studies were included if they contained original, quantitative data of self-isolation adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted definitions of self-isolation, measures used to quantify adherence, adherence rates, and factors associated with adherence. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022377820). Findings: We included 45 studies. Self-isolation was inconsistently defined. Only four studies did not use self-report to measure adherence. Of 41 studies using self-report measures, only one reported reliability; another gave indirect evidence for a lack of validity of the measure. Rates of adherence to self-isolation ranged from 0% to 100%. There was little evidence that self-isolation adherence was associated with socio-demographic or psychological factors. Interpretation: There was no consensus in defining, operationalising, or measuring self-isolation. Only one study presented evidence of the psychometric properties of the measure highlighting the significant risk of bias in included studies. This, and the dearth of scientifically rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to increase self-isolation adherence, is a fundamental gap in the literature. Funding: This study was funded by Research England Policy Support Fund 2022-23; authors were supported by the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response.\nHighly efficient and sensitive membrane-based concentration process allows quantification, surveillance, and sequencing of viruses in large volumes of wastewater.\nAuthors: El Soufi, G.; Di Jorio, L.; Gerber, Z.; Cluzel, N.; Van Assche, J.; Delafoy, D.; Olaso, R.; Daviaud, C.; Loustau, T.; Schwartz, C.; Trebouet, D.; Hernalsteens, O.; Marechal, V.; Raffestin, S.; Rousset, D.; Van Lint, C.; Deleuze, J.-F.; Boni, M.; OBEPINE Consortium, ; ROHR, O.; Villain-Gambier, M.; Wallet, C.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296071\nWastewater-based epidemiology is experiencing exponential development. Despite undeniable advantages compared to patient-centered approaches (cost, anonymity, survey of large populations without bias, detection of asymptomatic infected peoples...), major technical limitations persist. Among them is the low sensitivity of the current methods used for quantifying and sequencing viral genomes from wastewater. In situations of low viral circulation, during initial stages of viral emergences, or in countries experiencing heavy rains, the extremely low concentrations of viruses in wastewater may fall below the limit of detection of the current methods. The availability and cost of the commercial kits, as well as the requirement of expensive materials, can also present major blocks to the development of wastewater-based epidemiological survey, specifically in low-income countries. Thereby, highly sensitive, low cost and open-access methods are still needed to increase the predictability of the viral emergences, to survey low-circulating viruses and to allow wastewater-based surveillance. Here, we outline and characterize new protocols for concentrating, quantifying, monitoring, and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes (500 mL-1L) of raw wastewater. Our nucleic acid extraction technique (the routine C: 5ml method) does not require sophisticated equipment such as automatons and is not reliant on commercial kits, making it readily available to a broader range of laboratories for routine epidemiological survey. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency, the repeatability, and the high sensitivity of a new membrane-based concentration method (MBC: 500 mL method) for enveloped (SARS-CoV-2) and naked (FRNAPH GGII) viruses. We show that the MBC method allows the quantification and the monitoring of viruses in wastewater with a significantly improved sensitivity. In contexts of low viral circulation, we report quantifications of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at concentrations below 100 genome copies per liter and as low as 40 genome copies per liter. In highly diluted samples collected in wastewater treatment plants of French Guiana, we confirmed the accuracy of the MBC method compared to the estimations done with the C method. Finally, we demonstrate that both the C and MBC methods are compatible with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We show that the quality of the sequence is correlated with the concentration of the extracted viral genome. Of note, the quality of the sequences obtained with some MBC processed wastewater was improved by dilutions or enzyme substitutions suggesting the presence of specific enzyme inhibitors in some wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, our MBC method is the first efficient, sensitive, repeatable, and up-scalable method characterized for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and sequencing from large volumes of wastewater.

I.; Grad, Y.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295787\nDoxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.\nAssociations of Racial and Ethnic Composition of School Districts with Wildfire Smoke Exposure and Reduced In-Person Learning Among Schoolchildren During the Pandemic in the United States\nAuthors: Kim, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296000\nIntroductionThe White House has called for an \"all-hands-on-deck\" response to address chronic absenteeism and disrupted learning among K-12 students that spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures and shifts to remote learning in the United States. Such learning disruptions are linked to test score declines with lifelong implications for earnings and well-being. This study aimed to identify higher-risk student populations that might benefit from interventions to reduce such disruptions and related inequities by estimating the linkages between the racial and ethnic composition of U.S. K-12 school districts as predictors of average wildfire smoke levels and year-over-year declines in in-person student visits to schools during the pandemic. MethodsUsing multivariable logistic regression, 5-year (2012-2016) mean percentages of non-White students grouped into quartiles were investigated as predictors of school district-level outcomes consisting of: 1) 5-year (2012-2016) mean levels of wildfire smoke fine particulate matter 2.5 m or smaller in diameter (PM2.5) above 35 g/m3 (EPA health-based standard) during school days for grade 3-8 students from August 15 to June 15 of the following year; and 2) being above the median for the mean decline in in-person student attendance (vs. the same month in 2019), from September 2020 to May 2021 and September 2021 to May 2022. ResultsAcross 11,190 (82.4% of all) U.S. school districts, the highest (vs. lowest) quartile for the percentage of non-White students predicted a nearly 3-fold higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=2.82; 95% CI=2.14-3.72; P\u003c.001) for high wildfire smoke exposure and a 9-fold higher odds (AOR=9.12; 95% CI=7.15-11.63; P\u003c.001) for substantially reduced in-person learning levels. Successively higher odds were observed in higher quartiles (P for trend \u003c.001). Similar patterns were seen when high (vs. low) percentages of Asian-, Black-, and Hispanic-American students were modeled simultaneously. ConclusionsU.S. school districts with higher percentages of non-White students showed a convergence of elevated odds of wildfire smoke exposure and distance learning consistent with dose-response relationships. These concomitant risks could be mitigated by school-based air filtration interventions that reduce wildfire smoke PM2.5 and transmission of airborne particulates carrying the coronavirus. One potential cost-effective intervention to address these joint risks would be the placement of Corsi-Rosenthal boxes (DIY inexpensive portable air filtration devices shown to effectively reduce PM2.5 concentrations) in school classrooms and other school indoor areas. Supplying Corsi-Rosenthal boxes to school districts could markedly reduce learning disruptions and wildfire smoke and COVID-19 health impacts and their related inequities at a cost of less than $1 billion annually, 0.5% of the $190 billion in federal relief available to school districts to address pandemic-related needs including learning loss.\nImmunization Staff Training Needs Assessment: An Overview Of Findings From Cameroon\nAuthors: Adidja, A.; Sangwe Clovis, N.; Gu, J.; Lekeumo Cheuyem, F. Z.; Edwige, N. N. N.; Vouking, M. M.; Muteh, J. N.; Agbor, V. N. N.; Mvalo, M. C.; Bernard, N.; Ngenge, B. M.; Ndoula, s. T.; Njoh, A. A.; Mattei, P. D.; Tonga, C.; Saidu, Y.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295815\nBackgroundIn recent years, Cameroons Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has witnessed a sizable decline in its performance. Many stakeholders have cited weaknesses in human resources as one of the major drivers for the observed trend. In a bid to better understand and redress this situation, the EPI and its partners conducted a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) among central, regional, and district staff. The assessment aimed to quantify and characterize core capability gaps and leverage the findings to design an evidence-based capacity-building plan. MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using aggregated data from a survey carried out among EPI staff from May to September 2016 across Cameroons health pyramid - central, regional, and district levels; and analysis was done using Microsoft Office Excel 2016. ResultsOver half of EPI staff had worked for less than three years in their current post, and roughly three-third of them did not receive pre-service training on vaccination. Additionally, about half of them had not received any form of in-service training on immunization. Supportive supervision was the most frequently cited topic for training, with a surprisingly higher need at the central level (80%). Financial incentive was not a primary motivating factor for learning. Approximately half of the respondents at all levels were not aware of onboarding materials. Most of the respondents identified multiple meetings, high staff turnover, and competing priorities as major barriers to learning. Only about half of surveyed staff reported participating in performance reviews, with nearly half of these reviews conducted when an opportunity arose. ConclusionThere are still many gaps challenging the EPI goal achievement in Cameroon. Sustainably addressing these issues will require a comprehensive framing of capability-building activities. High-quality EPI human resources will boost the countrys vaccination performance and contribute to the reduction of infant mortality in the country.\n#ActuallyAutistic Twitter dataset for precision diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nAuthors: Jaiswal, A.; Washington, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295799\nThe increasing usage of social media platforms has given rise to an unprecedented surge in user- generated content with millions of users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and health-related information. Because of this social media has turned out to be a useful means to study and understand public health. Twitter is one such platform that has proven to be a valuable source of such information for both public and health officials. We present a novel dataset consisting of 6,515,470 tweets collected from users self identifying with autism using \"#ActuallyAutistic\" and a control group. The dataset also has supporting information such as posting dates, follower count, geographical location, and interaction metrics. We illustrate the utility of the dataset through common Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, tweet and user classification, and topic modeling. The textual differences in social media communications can help researchers and clinicians to conduct symptomatology studies, in natural settings, by establishing effective biomarkers to distinguish an autistic individual from their typical peers. For better accessibility, reusability and new research insights, we have released the dataset publicly.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPeople infected with COVID-19 may continue to experience symptoms for several weeks or even months after acute infection, a condition known as long COVID. Cognitive problems such as memory loss are among the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. However, a comprehensive evaluation on the risks of cognitive decline following COVID infection among different sociodemographic groups has not been undertaken at the national level in the United States.

MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis on the datasets from U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, encompassing the data collected from June 1, 2022 to December 19, 2022. Based on a cohort of 385,370 individuals aged 18 or older, we employed logistic regression analyses to examine the association between self-reported cognitive deficits and different sociodemographic factors among individuals with long COVID conditions.

ResultsAmong individuals aged 18 or older, 44.7% percent of survey respondents report having been diagnosed with COVID in the past, and 29.0% of those with previous COVID infection experienced long COVID symptoms lasting for more than 3 months. We have demonstrated that individuals with long COVID had significantly higher risk of experiencing cognitive deficits compared to those with no history of COVID infection. Furthermore, females, young adults, people with multiple races, or low levels of education attainment are at high risk of cognitive deficits if they experience long COVID. At the state level, the prevalence of cognitive deficits among long COVID patients varied across different US states, with the highest prevalence in West Virginia and Kentucky, and the lowest prevalence in Connecticut and Maryland. The variation could be due to differences in racial composition and education level among long COVID patients in the four states.

ConclusionsThe risks of cognitive deficits among adults with post-COVID conditions are substantial. Various sociodemographic groups can have different risks of developing cognitive deficits after experiencing long COVID. Findings of this large-scale study can help identify sociodemographic groups at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and facilitate medical interventions and guide resource allocation to target populations at risk and to prioritize areas with a high rate of cognitive decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Research ethics review committees (ERCs) worldwide faced daunting challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a need to balance rapid turnaround with rigorous evaluation of high-risk research protocols in the context of considerable uncertainty. This study explored the experiences and performance of ERCs during the pandemic.

We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, global online survey of chairs (or their delegates) of ERCs who were involved in the review of COVID-19-related research protocols after March 2020. The survey ran from October 2022 to February 2023 and consisted of 50 items, with opportunities for open text responses.

Two hundred and three participants [130 from high-income countries (HICs) and 73 from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)] completed our survey. Respondents came from diverse entities and organizations from 48 countries (19 HICs and 29 LMICs) in all World Health Organization regions. Responses show little of the increased global funding for COVID-19 research was allotted to the operation of ERCs. Few ERCs had pre-existing internal policies to address operation during public health emergencies, but almost half used existing guidelines. Most ERCs modified existing procedures or designed and implemented new ones but had not evaluated the success of these changes. Participants overwhelmingly endorsed permanently implementing several of them. Few ERCs added new members but non-member experts were consulted; quorum was generally achieved. Collaboration among ERCs was infrequent, but reviews conducted by external ERCs were recognized and validated. Review volume increased during the pandemic, with COVID-19-related studies being prioritized. Most protocol reviews were reported as taking less than three weeks. One-third of respondents reported external pressure on their ERCs from different stakeholders to approve or reject specific COVID-19-related protocols.

ERC members faced significant challenges to keep their committees functioning during the pandemic. Our findings can inform ERC approaches towards future public health emergencies. To our knowledge, this is the first international, COVID-19-related study of its kind.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia has the largest tuberculosis burden globally, but this burden varies nationwide. All-age tuberculosis prevalence in 2021 ranged from 747/100,000 in Delhi to 137/100,000 in Gujarat. Previous modelling has demonstrated the benefits and costs of introducing novel tuberculosis vaccines in India overall. However, no studies have compared the potential impact of tuberculosis vaccines in regions within India with differing tuberculosis disease and infection prevalence. We used mathematical modelling to investigate how the health and economic impact of two potential tuberculosis vaccines, M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination, could differ in Delhi and Gujarat under varying delivery strategies.

MethodsWe applied a compartmental tuberculosis model separately for Delhi (higher disease and infection prevalence) and Gujarat (lower disease and infection prevalence), and projected epidemiological trends to 2050 assuming no new vaccine introduction. We simulated M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios varying target ages and vaccine characteristics. We estimated cumulative cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years averted between 2025-2050 compared to the no-new-vaccine scenario and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to three cost-effectiveness thresholds.

ResultsM72/AS01E averted a higher proportion of tuberculosis cases than BCG-revaccination in both regions (Delhi: 16.0% vs 8.3%, Gujarat: 8.5% vs 5.1%) and had higher vaccination costs (Delhi: USD$118 million vs USD$27 million, Gujarat: US$366 million vs US$97 million). M72/AS01E in Delhi could be cost-effective, or even cost-saving, for all modelled vaccine characteristics. M72/AS01E could be cost-effective in Gujarat, unless efficacy was assumed only for those with current infection at vaccination. BCG-revaccination could be cost-effective, or cost-saving, in both regions for all modelled vaccine scenarios.

DiscussionM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in Delhi and Gujarat. Differences in impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness between vaccines and regions, were determined partly by differences in disease and infection prevalence, and demography. Age-specific regional estimates of infection prevalence could help to inform delivery strategies for vaccines that may only be effective in people with a particular infection status. Evidence on the mechanism of effect of M72/AS01E and its effectiveness in uninfected individuals, which were important drivers of impact and cost-effectiveness, particularly in Gujarat, are also key to improve estimates of population-level impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Self-isolation was used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and will likely be used in future infectious disease outbreaks. Method: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA and SWiM guidelines. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and grey literature sources were searched (1 January 2020 to 13 December 2022) using terms related to COVID-19, isolation, and adherence. Studies were included if they contained original, quantitative data of self-isolation adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted definitions of self-isolation, measures used to quantify adherence, adherence rates, and factors associated with adherence. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022377820). Findings: We included 45 studies. Self-isolation was inconsistently defined. Only four studies did not use self-report to measure adherence. Of 41 studies using self-report measures, only one reported reliability; another gave indirect evidence for a lack of validity of the measure. Rates of adherence to self-isolation ranged from 0% to 100%. There was little evidence that self-isolation adherence was associated with socio-demographic or psychological factors. Interpretation: There was no consensus in defining, operationalising, or measuring self-isolation. Only one study presented evidence of the psychometric properties of the measure highlighting the significant risk of bias in included studies. This, and the dearth of scientifically rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to increase self-isolation adherence, is a fundamental gap in the literature. Funding: This study was funded by Research England Policy Support Fund 2022-23; authors were supported by the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology is experiencing exponential development. Despite undeniable advantages compared to patient-centered approaches (cost, anonymity, survey of large populations without bias, detection of asymptomatic infected peoples...), major technical limitations persist. Among them is the low sensitivity of the current methods used for quantifying and sequencing viral genomes from wastewater. In situations of low viral circulation, during initial stages of viral emergences, or in countries experiencing heavy rains, the extremely low concentrations of viruses in wastewater may fall below the limit of detection of the current methods. The availability and cost of the commercial kits, as well as the requirement of expensive materials, can also present major blocks to the development of wastewater-based epidemiological survey, specifically in low-income countries. Thereby, highly sensitive, low cost and open-access methods are still needed to increase the predictability of the viral emergences, to survey low-circulating viruses and to allow wastewater-based surveillance. Here, we outline and characterize new protocols for concentrating, quantifying, monitoring, and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes (500 mL-1L) of raw wastewater. Our nucleic acid extraction technique (the routine C: 5ml method) does not require sophisticated equipment such as automatons and is not reliant on commercial kits, making it readily available to a broader range of laboratories for routine epidemiological survey. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency, the repeatability, and the high sensitivity of a new membrane-based concentration method (MBC: 500 mL method) for enveloped (SARS-CoV-2) and naked (FRNAPH GGII) viruses. We show that the MBC method allows the quantification and the monitoring of viruses in wastewater with a significantly improved sensitivity. In contexts of low viral circulation, we report quantifications of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at concentrations below 100 genome copies per liter and as low as 40 genome copies per liter. In highly diluted samples collected in wastewater treatment plants of French Guiana, we confirmed the accuracy of the MBC method compared to the estimations done with the C method. Finally, we demonstrate that both the C and MBC methods are compatible with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We show that the quality of the sequence is correlated with the concentration of the extracted viral genome. Of note, the quality of the sequences obtained with some MBC processed wastewater was improved by dilutions or enzyme substitutions suggesting the presence of specific enzyme inhibitors in some wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, our MBC method is the first efficient, sensitive, repeatable, and up-scalable method characterized for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and sequencing from large volumes of wastewater.

        <p class="abstract">Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe White House has called for an &#34;all-hands-on-deck&#34; response to address chronic absenteeism and disrupted learning among K-12 students that spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures and shifts to remote learning in the United States. Such learning disruptions are linked to test score declines with lifelong implications for earnings and well-being. This study aimed to identify higher-risk student populations that might benefit from interventions to reduce such disruptions and related inequities by estimating the linkages between the racial and ethnic composition of U.S. K-12 school districts as predictors of average wildfire smoke levels and year-over-year declines in in-person student visits to schools during the pandemic.

MethodsUsing multivariable logistic regression, 5-year (2012-2016) mean percentages of non-White students grouped into quartiles were investigated as predictors of school district-level outcomes consisting of: 1) 5-year (2012-2016) mean levels of wildfire smoke fine particulate matter 2.5 m or smaller in diameter (PM2.5) above 35 g/m3 (EPA health-based standard) during school days for grade 3-8 students from August 15 to June 15 of the following year; and 2) being above the median for the mean decline in in-person student attendance (vs. the same month in 2019), from September 2020 to May 2021 and September 2021 to May 2022.

ResultsAcross 11,190 (82.4% of all) U.S. school districts, the highest (vs. lowest) quartile for the percentage of non-White students predicted a nearly 3-fold higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=2.82; 95% CI=2.14-3.72; P&lt;.001) for high wildfire smoke exposure and a 9-fold higher odds (AOR=9.12; 95% CI=7.15-11.63; P&lt;.001) for substantially reduced in-person learning levels. Successively higher odds were observed in higher quartiles (P for trend &lt;.001). Similar patterns were seen when high (vs. low) percentages of Asian-, Black-, and Hispanic-American students were modeled simultaneously.

ConclusionsU.S. school districts with higher percentages of non-White students showed a convergence of elevated odds of wildfire smoke exposure and distance learning consistent with dose-response relationships. These concomitant risks could be mitigated by school-based air filtration interventions that reduce wildfire smoke PM2.5 and transmission of airborne particulates carrying the coronavirus. One potential cost-effective intervention to address these joint risks would be the placement of Corsi-Rosenthal boxes (DIY inexpensive portable air filtration devices shown to effectively reduce PM2.5 concentrations) in school classrooms and other school indoor areas. Supplying Corsi-Rosenthal boxes to school districts could markedly reduce learning disruptions and wildfire smoke and COVID-19 health impacts and their related inequities at a cost of less than $1 billion annually, 0.5% of the $190 billion in federal relief available to school districts to address pandemic-related needs including learning loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn recent years, Cameroons Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has witnessed a sizable decline in its performance. Many stakeholders have cited weaknesses in human resources as one of the major drivers for the observed trend. In a bid to better understand and redress this situation, the EPI and its partners conducted a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) among central, regional, and district staff. The assessment aimed to quantify and characterize core capability gaps and leverage the findings to design an evidence-based capacity-building plan.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using aggregated data from a survey carried out among EPI staff from May to September 2016 across Cameroons health pyramid - central, regional, and district levels; and analysis was done using Microsoft Office Excel 2016.

ResultsOver half of EPI staff had worked for less than three years in their current post, and roughly three-third of them did not receive pre-service training on vaccination. Additionally, about half of them had not received any form of in-service training on immunization. Supportive supervision was the most frequently cited topic for training, with a surprisingly higher need at the central level (80%). Financial incentive was not a primary motivating factor for learning. Approximately half of the respondents at all levels were not aware of onboarding materials. Most of the respondents identified multiple meetings, high staff turnover, and competing priorities as major barriers to learning. Only about half of surveyed staff reported participating in performance reviews, with nearly half of these reviews conducted when an opportunity arose.

ConclusionThere are still many gaps challenging the EPI goal achievement in Cameroon. Sustainably addressing these issues will require a comprehensive framing of capability-building activities. High-quality EPI human resources will boost the countrys vaccination performance and contribute to the reduction of infant mortality in the country.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing usage of social media platforms has given rise to an unprecedented surge in user- generated content with millions of users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and health-related information. Because of this social media has turned out to be a useful means to study and understand public health. Twitter is one such platform that has proven to be a valuable source of such information for both public and health officials. We present a novel dataset consisting of 6,515,470 tweets collected from users self identifying with autism using &#34;#ActuallyAutistic&#34; and a control group. The dataset also has supporting information such as posting dates, follower count, geographical location, and interaction metrics. We illustrate the utility of the dataset through common Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, tweet and user classification, and topic modeling. The textual differences in social media communications can help researchers and clinicians to conduct symptomatology studies, in natural settings, by establishing effective biomarkers to distinguish an autistic individual from their typical peers. For better accessibility, reusability and new research insights, we have released the dataset publicly.</p>
