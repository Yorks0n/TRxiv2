This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid. MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration. FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources. ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma. Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.\nDurability of protection from original monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes among adults in the United States -- September 2022-August 2023\nAuthors: DeCuir, J.; Surie, D.; Zhu, Y.; Lauring, A. S.; Gaglani, M.; McNeal, T.; Ghamande, S.; Peltan, I. D.; Brown, S. M.; Ginde, A. A.; Steinwand, A.; Mohr, N. M.; Gibbs, K. W.; Hager, D. N.; Ali, H.; Frosch, A.; Gong, M.

N\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.24300910\nObjectiveTo evaluate the durability of protection provided by original monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes. DesignMulticenter case-control design with prospective enrollment Setting26 hospitals in 20 US states ParticipantsAdults aged [\u0026ge;]18 years admitted to hospital with COVID-19-like illness from 8 September 2022 to 31 August 2023 Main outcome measuresThe main outcomes were absolute and relative vaccine effectiveness of original monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes, including advanced respiratory support (defined as receipt of high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]) and IMV or death. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using multivariable logistic regression, in which the odds of vaccination (versus being unvaccinated or receiving original monovalent vaccination only) were compared between COVID-19 case patients and control-patients. Bivalent vaccine effectiveness analyses were stratified by time since dose receipt. ResultsAmong 7028 adults without immunocompromising conditions, 2924 (41.6%) were COVID-19 case patients and 4104 (58.4%) were control patients. Compared to unvaccinated patients, absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 6% (-7% to 17%) for original monovalent doses only (median time since last dose [IQR] = 421 days [304-571]), 52% (39% to 61%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 13% (-10% to 31%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated advanced respiratory support was 31% (15% to 45%) for original monovalent doses only, 66% (47% to 78%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 33% (-1% to 55%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated IMV or death was 51% (34% to 63%) for original monovalent doses only, 61% (35% to 77%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 50% (11% to 71%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. ConclusionWhen compared to original monovalent vaccination only, bivalent COVID-19 vaccination provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and certain severe in-hospital outcomes within 3 months of dose receipt. By 3-6 months, protection from a bivalent dose declined to a level similar to that remaining from original monovalent vaccination only. Although no protection remained from original monovalent vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization, it provided durable protection against severe in-hospital outcomes \u003e1 year after receipt of the last dose, particularly against IMV or death. SUMMARY BOX What is already known on this topic- On September 1, 2022, bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for US adults who had completed at least an original monovalent COVID-19 primary series. - Early estimates of bivalent vaccine effectiveness are available for the period soon after dose receipt; however fewer data exist on their durability of protection and effectiveness against severe outcomes. What this study adds- When compared to original monovalent vaccination only, bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and certain severe in-hospital outcomes within 3 months of dose receipt. By 3-6 months, protection from a bivalent dose declined to a level similar to that remaining from original monovalent vaccination only. - Although no protection remained from original monovalent vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization, it provided durable protection against severe in-hospital outcomes \u003e1 year after receipt of the last dose, particularly against invasive mechanical ventilation or death.\nThe Mortality Burden from COVID in Low-Income Settings: Evidence from Verbal Autopsies in India\nAuthors: Malani, A.; Zhao, W.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300728\nMeasuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.\nTrends in long-term vaping among adults in England, 2013-2023\nAuthors: Jackson, S. E.; Tattan-Birch, H.; Shahab, L.; Brown, J.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300376\nObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping among adults in England. DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey. SettingEngland. Participants179,725 adults ([\u0026ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023. Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod). ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively). ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (\u003e6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults. What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people. C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use. C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping. C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day. C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301159\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major inequalities in infection burden between areas of varying socioeconomic deprivation in many countries, including England. Areas of higher deprivation tend to have a different population structure - generally younger - which can increase viral transmission due to higher contact rates in school-going children and working-age adults. Higher deprivation is also associated with higher presence of chronic comorbidities, which were convincingly demonstrated to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. These two major factors need to be combined to better understand and quantify their relative importance in the observed COVID-19 inequalities. Methods: We used UK Census data on health status and demography stratified by decile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which is a measure of socioeconomic deprivation. We calculated epidemiological impact using an age-stratified COVID-19 transmission model, which incorporated different contact patterns and clinical health profile by decile. To separate the contribution of each factor, we also considered a scenario where the clinical health profile of all deciles was at the level of the least deprived. We also considered the effectiveness of school closures in each decile. Results: In the modelled epidemics in urban areas, the most deprived decile experienced 9% more infections, 13% more clinical cases, and a 97% larger peak clinical size than the least deprived; we found similar inequalities in rural areas. 21% of clinical cases and 16% of deaths in England observed under the model assumptions would not occur if all deciles experienced the clinical health profile of the least deprived decile. We found that more deaths were prevented in more affluent areas during school closures. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that both clinical and demographic factors synergise to generate health inequalities in COVID-19, that improving the clinical health profile of populations would increase health equity, and that some interventions can increase health inequalities.\nSARS-CoV-2 wastewater variant surveillance: pandemic response leveraging FDA's GenomeTrakr network\nAuthors: Timme, R. E.; Woods, J.; Jones, J. L.; Calci, K. R.; Rodriguez, R.; Barnes, C.; Hyde-Leard, E. J.; Craven, M.; Chen, H.; Boerner, C.; Grim, C. J.; Windsor, A.; Ramachandran, P.; Muruvanda, T.; Rand, H.; Tesfaldet, B.; Amirzadegan, J.; Kayikcioglu, T.; Walsky, T.; Allard, M. W.; Balkey, M.; Bias, C. H.; Brown, E.; Judy, K.; Lusk Pfefer, T.; Tallent, S. M.; Hoffmann, M.; Pettengill, J.; GenomeTrakr Laboratory Consortium, Score: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301101\nWastewater surveillance has emerged as a crucial public health tool for population-level pathogen surveillance. Supported by funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the FDAs genomic epidemiology program, GenomeTrakr, was leveraged to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater sites across the United States. This initiative required the evaluation, optimization, development, and publication of new methods and analytical tools spanning sample collection through variant analyses. Version-controlled protocols for each step of the process were developed and published on protocols.io. A custom data analysis tool and a publicly accessible dashboard were built to facilitate real-time visualization of the collected data, focusing on the relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages across different samples and sites throughout the project. From September 2021 through June 2023, a total of 3,389 wastewater samples were collected, with 2,517 undergoing sequencing and submission to NCBI under the umbrella BioProject, PRJNA757291. Sequence data were released with explicit quality control (QC) tags on all sequence records, communicating our confidence in the quality of data. Variant analysis revealed wide circulation of Delta in the fall of 2021 and captured the sweep of Omicron and subsequent diversification of this lineage through the end of the sampling period. This project successfully achieved two important goals for the FDAs GenomeTrakr program: first, contributing timely genomic data for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response, and second, establishing both capacity and best practices for culture-independent, population-level environmental surveillance for other pathogens of interest to the FDA. IMPORTANCEThis manuscript serves two primary objectives. Firstly, it summarizes the genomic and contextual data collected during a Covid-19 pandemic response project, which utilized the FDAs laboratory network, traditionally employed for sequencing foodborne pathogens, for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples. Secondly, it outlines best practices for gathering and organizing population-level Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data collected for culture-free, surveillance of pathogens sourced from environmental samples.\nProfiling health and socioeconomic disadvantage in the northern Adelaide Local Health Network population.\nAuthors: Shoubridge, C.; Maddison, J.; Lynch, J.; Boyd, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300748\nObjectiveWe describe aspects of social disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region, demonstrate how living with disadvantage impacts health outcomes to understand how the local health network can better serve this disadvantaged community. DesignUsing large scale, population-based data from the 2021 census we captured a snapshot of the disadvantage and health status of the community within the northern Adelaide region compared to the central and southern regions of Adelaide and other Australian capital cities. ResultsNorthern Adelaide is a region of greater relative disadvantage, as shown by both the low Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage score (993) compared to the national average (1000) and scores above the national average for the central and southern Adelaide regions. Social determinants that contribute to this relative disadvantage include the proportion of people with no or limited education (26%) and those living on constrained income sources (e.g. unemployment benefits / aged pension, 10% and 72%, respectively). The northern Adelaide region has higher burdens of long-term health conditions including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and lung diseases. The comparatively high prevalence of obesity (37%) for people in the north of Adelaide were associated with low numbers of people with adequate fruit intake (48%) and the higher proportion of people who currently smoke (16%) and who undertake low or no levels of exercise (73%). ConclusionsSocial disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region is associated with poorer health outcomes and higher levels of health risk behaviour compared to the less disadvantaged central and southern regions of Adelaide. Adapting health care to recognise this association may help improve the health of people living with disadvantage. Summary boxO_LIThe known. The northern Adelaide region is a disadvantaged community. C_LIO_LIThe new. Here we demonstrate the types and prevalence of social determinants of health and the health status of the northern Adelaide community compared to other regions of greater Adelaide and other greater Australian capital cities. C_LIO_LIThe implications. This snapshot of the local social determinants of health sets a context for the health system to respond to the well-being needs of a community that are driven by some of the most adverse social determinants in Australia.

From 5th February till 6th May 2023 all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples were monitored for genetic changes. Methods: A total of 1757 samples having Ct value \u003c25 (for E and ORF gene) from different districts of Rajasthan were processed for Next Generation sequencing (NGS). The FASTA files obtained on sequencing were used for lineage determination using Nextclade and phylogenetic tree construction. Results and discussion: Sequencing and lineage identification was done in 1624 samples. XBB.1.16 was the predominant lineage in 1413(87.0%) cases while rest was other XBB (207, 12.74%) and other lineages (4, 0.2%). Of the 1413 XBB.1.16 cases, 57.47% were males and 42.53% were females. Majority (66.53%) belonged to 19-59 year age. 84.15% of XBB.1.16 cases were infected for the first time. Hospitalization was required in only 2.2% cases and death was reported in 5 (0.35%) patients. Most of the cases were symptomatic and the commonest symptoms were fever, cough and rhinorrhoea. Co-morbidities were present in 414 (29.3%) cases. Enhanced genomic surveillance helped to rapidly identify the spread of XBB variant in Rajasthan. This in turn helped to take control measures to prevent spread of virus and estimate public health risks of the new variant relative to the previously circulating lineages. XBB variant was found to spread rapidly but produced milder disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimLong Covid can be a stigmatising condition, particularly in people who are disadvantaged within society. This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid.

MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration.

FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources.

ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma.

Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo evaluate the durability of protection provided by original monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes.

DesignMulticenter case-control design with prospective enrollment

Setting26 hospitals in 20 US states

ParticipantsAdults aged [&amp;ge;]18 years admitted to hospital with COVID-19-like illness from 8 September 2022 to 31 August 2023

Main outcome measuresThe main outcomes were absolute and relative vaccine effectiveness of original monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe in-hospital outcomes, including advanced respiratory support (defined as receipt of high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]) and IMV or death. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using multivariable logistic regression, in which the odds of vaccination (versus being unvaccinated or receiving original monovalent vaccination only) were compared between COVID-19 case patients and control-patients. Bivalent vaccine effectiveness analyses were stratified by time since dose receipt.

ResultsAmong 7028 adults without immunocompromising conditions, 2924 (41.6%) were COVID-19 case patients and 4104 (58.4%) were control patients. Compared to unvaccinated patients, absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 6% (-7% to 17%) for original monovalent doses only (median time since last dose [IQR] = 421 days [304-571]), 52% (39% to 61%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 13% (-10% to 31%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated advanced respiratory support was 31% (15% to 45%) for original monovalent doses only, 66% (47% to 78%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 33% (-1% to 55%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier. Absolute vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated IMV or death was 51% (34% to 63%) for original monovalent doses only, 61% (35% to 77%) for a bivalent dose received 7-89 days earlier, and 50% (11% to 71%) for a bivalent dose received 90-179 days earlier.

ConclusionWhen compared to original monovalent vaccination only, bivalent COVID-19 vaccination provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and certain severe in-hospital outcomes within 3 months of dose receipt. By 3-6 months, protection from a bivalent dose declined to a level similar to that remaining from original monovalent vaccination only. Although no protection remained from original monovalent vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization, it provided durable protection against severe in-hospital outcomes &gt;1 year after receipt of the last dose, particularly against IMV or death.

SUMMARY BOX What is already known on this topic- On September 1, 2022, bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for US adults who had completed at least an original monovalent COVID-19 primary series.
- Early estimates of bivalent vaccine effectiveness are available for the period soon after dose receipt; however fewer data exist on their durability of protection and effectiveness against severe outcomes.


What this study adds- When compared to original monovalent vaccination only, bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and certain severe in-hospital outcomes within 3 months of dose receipt. By 3-6 months, protection from a bivalent dose declined to a level similar to that remaining from original monovalent vaccination only.
- Although no protection remained from original monovalent vaccination against COVID-19-associated hospitalization, it provided durable protection against severe in-hospital outcomes &gt;1 year after receipt of the last dose, particularly against invasive mechanical ventilation or death.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Measuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo examine trends in long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping among adults in England.

DesignNationally-representative monthly cross-sectional survey.

SettingEngland.

Participants179,725 adults ([&amp;ge;]18y) surveyed between October 2013 and October 2023.

Main outcome measuresWe used logistic regression to estimate time trends in the prevalence of long-term vaping, overall and by vaping frequency (daily/non-daily) and the main device type used (disposable/refillable/pod).

ResultsThe proportion of adults reporting long-term vaping increased non-linearly from 1.3% [95%CI 1.1-1.5%] in October 2013 to 10.0% [9.2-10.9%] in October 2023, with a particularly pronounced rise since 2021. This included an increase in long-term daily vaping, which rose from 0.6% [0.5-0.8%] to 6.7% [6.0-7.4%], respectively. The absolute increases in long-term vaping were most pronounced among ever smokers (current smokers: 4.8% [4.0-5.8%] to 23.1% [20.4-25.9%]; recent ex-smokers: 5.7% [3.4-9.2%] to 36.1% [27.6-45.4%]; long-term ex-smokers: 1.4% [1.0-1.9%] to 16.2% [14.2-18.4%]), but there was also an increase among never smokers (0.1% [0.0-0.2%] to 3.0% [2.3-3.8%]). Growth was also most pronounced in younger adults (e.g., reaching 22.7% [19.2-26.5%] of 18-year-olds vs. 4.3% [3.6-5.2%] of 65-year-olds), including among never smokers (reaching 16.1% [11.1-22.7%] among 18-year-olds vs. 0.3% [0.1-0.6%] of 65-year-olds). Up to March 2021, most long-term vapers mainly/exclusively used refillable e-cigarettes (2.5-3.3% of adults) and very few (0.1% of adults) used disposables. However, prevalence of long-term disposable vaping subsequently rose rapidly and by October 2023, similar proportions mainly/exclusively used refillable and disposable devices (4.6% [4.0-5.3%] and 4.9% [4.2-5.7%] of adults, respectively).

ConclusionsThe prevalence of long-term (&gt;6 months) vaping has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. Much of this increase in prevalence has occurred since 2021, coinciding with the rapid rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth has been concentrated among ever smokers but there has also been an increase among never smokers, especially younger adults.

What is already known on this topicO_LIVaping prevalence has increased substantially in England since new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in mid-2021, particularly among young people.
C_LIO_LIIt is not clear how far this reflects an increase in experimental use versus long-term, regular use.
C_LIO_LIIn addition, little is known about how the types of products used by long-term vapers is changing over time.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThere has been an exceptionally steep rise in long-term vaping among young adults since 2021, including among never smoking youth, and it does not yet show signs of stopping.
C_LIO_LIHalf of long-term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposables, and most are using them every day.
C_LIO_LITherefore, urgent action is needed to curb the rise in vaping among young people and encourage long-term vapers to transition to less environmentally damaging products.

        <p class="abstract">Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major inequalities in infection burden between areas of varying socioeconomic deprivation in many countries, including England. Areas of higher deprivation tend to have a different population structure - generally younger - which can increase viral transmission due to higher contact rates in school-going children and working-age adults. Higher deprivation is also associated with higher presence of chronic comorbidities, which were convincingly demonstrated to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. These two major factors need to be combined to better understand and quantify their relative importance in the observed COVID-19 inequalities. Methods: We used UK Census data on health status and demography stratified by decile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which is a measure of socioeconomic deprivation. We calculated epidemiological impact using an age-stratified COVID-19 transmission model, which incorporated different contact patterns and clinical health profile by decile. To separate the contribution of each factor, we also considered a scenario where the clinical health profile of all deciles was at the level of the least deprived. We also considered the effectiveness of school closures in each decile. Results: In the modelled epidemics in urban areas, the most deprived decile experienced 9% more infections, 13% more clinical cases, and a 97% larger peak clinical size than the least deprived; we found similar inequalities in rural areas. 21% of clinical cases and 16% of deaths in England observed under the model assumptions would not occur if all deciles experienced the clinical health profile of the least deprived decile. We found that more deaths were prevented in more affluent areas during school closures. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that both clinical and demographic factors synergise to generate health inequalities in COVID-19, that improving the clinical health profile of populations would increase health equity, and that some interventions can increase health inequalities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a crucial public health tool for population-level pathogen surveillance. Supported by funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the FDAs genomic epidemiology program, GenomeTrakr, was leveraged to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater sites across the United States. This initiative required the evaluation, optimization, development, and publication of new methods and analytical tools spanning sample collection through variant analyses. Version-controlled protocols for each step of the process were developed and published on protocols.io. A custom data analysis tool and a publicly accessible dashboard were built to facilitate real-time visualization of the collected data, focusing on the relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages across different samples and sites throughout the project. From September 2021 through June 2023, a total of 3,389 wastewater samples were collected, with 2,517 undergoing sequencing and submission to NCBI under the umbrella BioProject, PRJNA757291. Sequence data were released with explicit quality control (QC) tags on all sequence records, communicating our confidence in the quality of data. Variant analysis revealed wide circulation of Delta in the fall of 2021 and captured the sweep of Omicron and subsequent diversification of this lineage through the end of the sampling period. This project successfully achieved two important goals for the FDAs GenomeTrakr program: first, contributing timely genomic data for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response, and second, establishing both capacity and best practices for culture-independent, population-level environmental surveillance for other pathogens of interest to the FDA.

IMPORTANCEThis manuscript serves two primary objectives. Firstly, it summarizes the genomic and contextual data collected during a Covid-19 pandemic response project, which utilized the FDAs laboratory network, traditionally employed for sequencing foodborne pathogens, for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples. Secondly, it outlines best practices for gathering and organizing population-level Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data collected for culture-free, surveillance of pathogens sourced from environmental samples.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveWe describe aspects of social disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region, demonstrate how living with disadvantage impacts health outcomes to understand how the local health network can better serve this disadvantaged community.

DesignUsing large scale, population-based data from the 2021 census we captured a snapshot of the disadvantage and health status of the community within the northern Adelaide region compared to the central and southern regions of Adelaide and other Australian capital cities.

ResultsNorthern Adelaide is a region of greater relative disadvantage, as shown by both the low Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage score (993) compared to the national average (1000) and scores above the national average for the central and southern Adelaide regions. Social determinants that contribute to this relative disadvantage include the proportion of people with no or limited education (26%) and those living on constrained income sources (e.g. unemployment benefits / aged pension, 10% and 72%, respectively). The northern Adelaide region has higher burdens of long-term health conditions including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and lung diseases. The comparatively high prevalence of obesity (37%) for people in the north of Adelaide were associated with low numbers of people with adequate fruit intake (48%) and the higher proportion of people who currently smoke (16%) and who undertake low or no levels of exercise (73%).

ConclusionsSocial disadvantage in the northern Adelaide region is associated with poorer health outcomes and higher levels of health risk behaviour compared to the less disadvantaged central and southern regions of Adelaide. Adapting health care to recognise this association may help improve the health of people living with disadvantage.

Summary boxO_LIThe known. The northern Adelaide region is a disadvantaged community.
C_LIO_LIThe new. Here we demonstrate the types and prevalence of social determinants of health and the health status of the northern Adelaide community compared to other regions of greater Adelaide and other greater Australian capital cities.
C_LIO_LIThe implications. This snapshot of the local social determinants of health sets a context for the health system to respond to the well-being needs of a community that are driven by some of the most adverse social determinants in Australia.

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; objectives: Genomic surveillance of positive SARS-CoV-2 samples is important to monitor the genetic changes occurring in virus, this was enhanced after the WHO designation of XBB.1.16 as a variant under monitoring in March 2023. From 5th February till 6th May 2023 all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples were monitored for genetic changes. Methods: A total of 1757 samples having Ct value &lt;25 (for E and ORF gene) from different districts of Rajasthan were processed for Next Generation sequencing (NGS). The FASTA files obtained on sequencing were used for lineage determination using Nextclade and phylogenetic tree construction. Results and discussion: Sequencing and lineage identification was done in 1624 samples. XBB.1.16 was the predominant lineage in 1413(87.0%) cases while rest was other XBB (207, 12.74%) and other lineages (4, 0.2%). Of the 1413 XBB.1.16 cases, 57.47% were males and 42.53% were females. Majority (66.53%) belonged to 19-59 year age. 84.15% of XBB.1.16 cases were infected for the first time. Hospitalization was required in only 2.2% cases and death was reported in 5 (0.35%) patients. Most of the cases were symptomatic and the commonest symptoms were fever, cough and rhinorrhoea. Co-morbidities were present in 414 (29.3%) cases. Enhanced genomic surveillance helped to rapidly identify the spread of XBB variant in Rajasthan. This in turn helped to take control measures to prevent spread of virus and estimate public health risks of the new variant relative to the previously circulating lineages. XBB variant was found to spread rapidly but produced milder disease.</p>
