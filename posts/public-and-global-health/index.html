MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S. L.; Howerton, E.; Contamin, L.; Smith, C. P.; Carcelen, E. C.; Yan, K.; Bents, S. J.; Espino, J.; Levander, J.; Lemaitre, J. C.; Sato, K.; McKee, C. D.; Hill, A. L.; Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J.

A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; Hurt, B.; Chen,\nScore: 65.1, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nAn emerging clade of Chikungunya West African genotype discovered in real-time during 2023 outbreak in Senegal\nAuthors: Padane, A.; Tegally, H.; Ramphal, Y.; Ndiaye, S.; Sarr, M.; Diop, M.

T.; Tinto, B.; Ouedraogo, A.-S.; Lourenco, J.; Giovanetti, M.; Giandhari, J.; de Oliveira, T.; Mboup, S.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298527\nChikungunya (CHIKV) is a re-emerging endemic arbovirus in West Africa. Since July 2023, Senegal and Burkina Faso have been experiencing an ongoing outbreak, with over 300 confirmed cases detected so far in the regions of Kedougou and Tambacounda in Senegal, the largest recorded outbreak yet. CHIKV is typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle in Senegal but its evolution and factors contributing to re-emergence are so far unknown in West Africa, leaving a gap in understanding and responding to recurrent epidemics. We produced, in real-time, the first locally-generated and publicly available CHIKV whole genomes in West Africa, to characterize the genetic diversity of circulating strains, along with phylodynamic analysis to estimate time of emergence and population growth dynamics. A novel strain of the West African genotype, phylogenetically distinct from strains circulating in previous outbreaks, was identified. This suggests a likely new spillover from sylvatic cycles in rural Senegal and potential of seeding larger epidemics in urban settings in Senegal and elsewhere.\nImportations of SARS-CoV-2 lineages decline after nonpharmaceutical interventions in phylogeographic analyses\nAuthors: Goliaei, S.; Foroughmand-Araabi, M.-H.; Roddy, A.; Weber, A.; Oeversti, S.; Kuehnert, D.; McHardy, A. C.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298337\nThe onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic marked a period of substantial challenges as the virus and its variants rapidly spread, placing enormous strain on both society and healthcare systems. Prior to the widespread availability of vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as reducing contacts, antigenic testing, or travel restrictions were the primary means of reducing viral transmission and case numbers, and quantifying the success of these measures is therefore key for future pandemic preparedness. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in systematic surveillance, we studied lineage importations for the third, pandemic wave in Germany, employing a large-scale Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis coupled to a longitudinal assessment of lineage importation dynamics over multiple sampling strategies. We evaluated the effect of twelve major nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on lineage importations and dissemination within the country. All NPIs were followed by reduced lineage importations, with the most substantial decreases seen for the provision of free rapid tests, the strengthening of regulations on mask-wearing in public transport and stores, as well as on internal movements and gatherings. Most SARS-CoV-2 lineages first appeared in the three states with the largest populations and most cases, and from there spread within the country. Importations began to rise before and peaked shortly after the Christmas holidays. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data revealed the substantial effects of free rapid tests and obligatory medical/surgical mask-wearing, suggesting these as key for pandemic preparedness, given their relatively few, negative socioeconomic effects. The approach quantifies the relationships between environmental factors at the host population level to viral lineage dissemination from genomic surveillance data, facilitating similar analyses of rapidly evolving pathogens in the future.\nEffectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the period January 2021 until May 2022: A systematic literature review\nAuthors: Vardavas, C. I.; Nikitara, K.; Aslanoglou, K.; Marou, V.; Plyta, Z.; Phalkey, R.; Leonardi Bee, J.; Condell, O.; Lamb, F.; Suk, J. E.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298350\nObjectivesIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. DesignWe searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator. Main outcome measuresOutcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively. Results49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive. ConclusionsThis systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs. What is already known on this topicPrior to this study, it was recognised that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hygiene measures, face mask usage, travel restrictions, social distancing, and contact tracing were implemented worldwide. The scientific community has been assessing the effectiveness of these NPIs in mitigating the pandemics impact on public health and the economy. What this study addsThis systematic review contributes by presenting updated and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of NPIs as a means of mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission, using both real-world evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. The study affirms that the timely application of NPIs, including the use of face masks, stay-at-home orders, restrictions on mass gatherings, and school closures, substantially reduced COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It underscores the significance of employing multiple NPIs in tandem for heightened effectiveness within future respiratory pandemics. The review emphasises the necessity for ongoing assessment of NPI efficacy, taking into account factors such as public compliance, vaccination rates, and the prevalence of virus variants. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe findings of this study carry various implications. Firstly, they inform policymakers about the critical importance of promptly implementing NPIs and employing them in combination to manage respiratory pandemics. Secondly, the results underscore the enduring relevance of NPIs even as pandemic vaccination campaigns progress. Thirdly, the study highlights the need for standardized methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Lastly, this review can guide future public health strategies by offering valuable insights into the impact of different interventions on pandemic control.\nWastewater surveillance pilot at US military installations: a cost model analysis\nAuthors: Sanjak, J. S.; McAuley, E. M.; Pinkhma, R.; Tarnowski, J.; Miko, N.; Rasmussen, B.; Manalo, C.; Goodson, M.; Stamps, B.; Necciai, B. D.; Sozhamannan, S.; Maier, E. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298310\nBackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the need for pathogen surveillance systems to augment both early warning and outbreak monitoring/control efforts. Wastewater samples provide a rapid and accurate source of environmental surveillance data to complement direct patient sampling. Due to its global presence and critical missions, the US military is a leader in global pandemic preparedness efforts. Clinical testing for COVID-19 on US Air Force (USAF) bases (AFBs) was effective, but costly with respect to direct costs and indirect costs of lost time. To remain operating at peak capacity such bases sought a more passive surveillance option and piloted wastewater surveillance (WWS) at 17 AFBs to demonstrate feasibility, safety, and utility from May 2021 to January 2022. ObjectiveHere we model the costs of a wastewater program for pathogens of pandemic potential within the specific context of US military installations using assumptions based on the results of the USAF and Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) pilot program. The objective was to determine the cost of deploying WWS to all AFBs, relative to clinical swab testing surveillance regimes. MethodsA simple WWS cost projection model was built based on subject matter expert input and actual costs incurred during a WWS pilot program at USAF AFBs. Several SARS-CoV-2 circulation scenarios were considered and costs of both WWS and clinical swab testing were projected. Break even analysis was conducted to determine how reduction in swab testing could open up space to enable WWS to occur in complement. ResultsOur model confirms that wastewater surveillance is complimentary and highly cost-effective when compared to existing alternative forms of biosurveillance. We find that the cost of WWS was between $10.5 - $18.5 million less expensive annually in direct costs as compared to clinical swab testing surveillance. When indirect cost of lost work is incorporated, including assumed lost work required to go obtain a clinical swab test, we estimate that over two thirds of clinical swab testing could be maintained with no additional costs upon implementation of WWS. ConclusionsOur results support adoption of wastewater surveillance across US military installations as part of a more comprehensive and early warning system that will enable adaptive monitoring during disease outbreaks.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized.

MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience.

ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chikungunya (CHIKV) is a re-emerging endemic arbovirus in West Africa. Since July 2023, Senegal and Burkina Faso have been experiencing an ongoing outbreak, with over 300 confirmed cases detected so far in the regions of Kedougou and Tambacounda in Senegal, the largest recorded outbreak yet. CHIKV is typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle in Senegal but its evolution and factors contributing to re-emergence are so far unknown in West Africa, leaving a gap in understanding and responding to recurrent epidemics. We produced, in real-time, the first locally-generated and publicly available CHIKV whole genomes in West Africa, to characterize the genetic diversity of circulating strains, along with phylodynamic analysis to estimate time of emergence and population growth dynamics. A novel strain of the West African genotype, phylogenetically distinct from strains circulating in previous outbreaks, was identified. This suggests a likely new spillover from sylvatic cycles in rural Senegal and potential of seeding larger epidemics in urban settings in Senegal and elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic marked a period of substantial challenges as the virus and its variants rapidly spread, placing enormous strain on both society and healthcare systems. Prior to the widespread availability of vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as reducing contacts, antigenic testing, or travel restrictions were the primary means of reducing viral transmission and case numbers, and quantifying the success of these measures is therefore key for future pandemic preparedness. Using SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in systematic surveillance, we studied lineage importations for the third, pandemic wave in Germany, employing a large-scale Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis coupled to a longitudinal assessment of lineage importation dynamics over multiple sampling strategies. We evaluated the effect of twelve major nationwide nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on lineage importations and dissemination within the country. All NPIs were followed by reduced lineage importations, with the most substantial decreases seen for the provision of free rapid tests, the strengthening of regulations on mask-wearing in public transport and stores, as well as on internal movements and gatherings. Most SARS-CoV-2 lineages first appeared in the three states with the largest populations and most cases, and from there spread within the country. Importations began to rise before and peaked shortly after the Christmas holidays. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data revealed the substantial effects of free rapid tests and obligatory medical/surgical mask-wearing, suggesting these as key for pandemic preparedness, given their relatively few, negative socioeconomic effects. The approach quantifies the relationships between environmental factors at the host population level to viral lineage dissemination from genomic surveillance data, facilitating similar analyses of rapidly evolving pathogens in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies.

DesignWe searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator.

Main outcome measuresOutcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively.

Results49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive.

ConclusionsThis systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs.

What is already known on this topicPrior to this study, it was recognised that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hygiene measures, face mask usage, travel restrictions, social distancing, and contact tracing were implemented worldwide. The scientific community has been assessing the effectiveness of these NPIs in mitigating the pandemics impact on public health and the economy.

What this study addsThis systematic review contributes by presenting updated and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of NPIs as a means of mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission, using both real-world evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. The study affirms that the timely application of NPIs, including the use of face masks, stay-at-home orders, restrictions on mass gatherings, and school closures, substantially reduced COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It underscores the significance of employing multiple NPIs in tandem for heightened effectiveness within future respiratory pandemics. The review emphasises the necessity for ongoing assessment of NPI efficacy, taking into account factors such as public compliance, vaccination rates, and the prevalence of virus variants.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe findings of this study carry various implications. Firstly, they inform policymakers about the critical importance of promptly implementing NPIs and employing them in combination to manage respiratory pandemics. Secondly, the results underscore the enduring relevance of NPIs even as pandemic vaccination campaigns progress. Thirdly, the study highlights the need for standardized methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Lastly, this review can guide future public health strategies by offering valuable insights into the impact of different interventions on pandemic control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the need for pathogen surveillance systems to augment both early warning and outbreak monitoring/control efforts. Wastewater samples provide a rapid and accurate source of environmental surveillance data to complement direct patient sampling. Due to its global presence and critical missions, the US military is a leader in global pandemic preparedness efforts. Clinical testing for COVID-19 on US Air Force (USAF) bases (AFBs) was effective, but costly with respect to direct costs and indirect costs of lost time. To remain operating at peak capacity such bases sought a more passive surveillance option and piloted wastewater surveillance (WWS) at 17 AFBs to demonstrate feasibility, safety, and utility from May 2021 to January 2022.

ObjectiveHere we model the costs of a wastewater program for pathogens of pandemic potential within the specific context of US military installations using assumptions based on the results of the USAF and Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) pilot program. The objective was to determine the cost of deploying WWS to all AFBs, relative to clinical swab testing surveillance regimes.

MethodsA simple WWS cost projection model was built based on subject matter expert input and actual costs incurred during a WWS pilot program at USAF AFBs. Several SARS-CoV-2 circulation scenarios were considered and costs of both WWS and clinical swab testing were projected. Break even analysis was conducted to determine how reduction in swab testing could open up space to enable WWS to occur in complement.

ResultsOur model confirms that wastewater surveillance is complimentary and highly cost-effective when compared to existing alternative forms of biosurveillance. We find that the cost of WWS was between $10.5 - $18.5 million less expensive annually in direct costs as compared to clinical swab testing surveillance. When indirect cost of lost work is incorporated, including assumed lost work required to go obtain a clinical swab test, we estimate that over two thirds of clinical swab testing could be maintained with no additional costs upon implementation of WWS.

ConclusionsOur results support adoption of wastewater surveillance across US military installations as part of a more comprehensive and early warning system that will enable adaptive monitoring during disease outbreaks.</p>
