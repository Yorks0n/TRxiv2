G.; Respiratory Virus Transmission Network Study Group, Score: 155.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297317\nBackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, but it is less clear what effect vaccines have on reducing the risk of infection in high contact settings like households, alone or in combination with prior infection. MethodsHouseholds with an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Sep 2021-May 2023 were screened nationwide and at 7 sentinel sites and enrolled if the index cases illness onset was [\u0026le;]6 days prior. Household members had daily self-collected nasal swabs tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination status was assessed by plausible self-report (with date) or vaccination records. Prior infection was assessed by self-reported prior testing and by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies presence at enrollment. The effects of prior immunity, including vaccination, prior infection, or hybrid immunity (both vaccination and prior infection) on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among household contacts were assessed by robust, clustered multivariable Poisson regression. FindingsThere were 1,532 contacts from 905 households included in this analysis. Of these, 67% were enrolled May-November 2022, when Omicron BA.4/5 predominated. Most contacts (89%) had some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of household exposure: 8% had immunity from prior infection alone, 51% from vaccination alone, and 29% had hybrid immunity. Sixty percent of contacts tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during follow-up. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly reduced by vaccination but was reduced among those with prior infection considering such immunity separately (adjusted relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.90); however, when accounting for both sources of immunity, only contacts with vaccination and prior infection had significantly reduced risk of infection (aRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.93). The risk of infection was lower when the last immunizing event (vaccination or infection) occurred [\u0026le;]6 months before COVID-19 affected the household (aRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83). InterpretationImmunity from COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection was synergistic in protecting household contacts from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support COVID-19 vaccination, even for those who have been previously infected. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the terms (\"hybrid immunity\" or \"natural immunity\") AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" or COVID*) in October of 2023 to identify previous research into the role of hybrid immunity (defined as immunity from prior infection and vaccination) in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We reviewed 512 articles for estimates of the association between hybrid immunity and susceptibility to illness, infection, or reinfection in humans. Multiple previous meta-analyses were identified, including a meta-regression from 2023 finding that hybrid immunity was associated with 61% reduction in risk of infection compared to immune-naive individuals 6 months after the immunizing event. The estimates included in this meta-regression were all published before June of 2022, prior to the widespread circulation of Omicron BA.4, BA.5, or recombinant lineages, and none reported on the risk of infection in a setting of household exposures. Added value of the studyIn a pair of multi-site case-ascertained household transmission investigations with the majority of enrollments occurring during the Omicron BA4/5 predominant periods, the risk of infection among household contacts of a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. In a study design with systematic, daily testing of household contacts regardless of symptoms, serological verification of prior infection, and vaccine verification, the primary result of analyses of infection risk among household contacts was that this risk was lowest among those with hybrid immunity. The estimate of the magnitude of this protection was lower than in previous reports of protection in other settings. Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household contacts was lowest among those with hybrid immunity, compared to those with no previous immunity, vaccination alone, or previous infection alone. These findings underscore the importance of staying updated with COVID-19 vaccinations, even for individuals with prior infection.\nExcess deaths in China during SARS-CoV-2 viral waves in 2022-2023\nAuthors: Jha, P.; Brown, P. E.; Lam, T.; Morawski, E.; Reid, A.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.23297204\nBackgroundThe extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented. MethodsWe worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined agespecific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019. FindingsThe survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60+ years and 212 were women. At ages 60+ years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60+ years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1{middle dot}35 million excess deaths over the two months. InterpretationChina experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.

J.; Qian, L.; Farrington, P.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Klein, N. P.; Fireman, B.; Han, B.; Lewin, B. J.\nScore: 141.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nREADi-Dem: ML-powered, web-interface tool for Robust, Efficient, Affordable Diagnosis of Dementia\nAuthors: Klar, V.; Thompson, E.; Atay, M. S.; Owoade, P.; Toniolo, S.; Dehsarvi, A.; Rathee, S.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297405\nBackground: Dementia screening tools typically involve face-to-face cognitive testing. Indeed, this introduces an increasing burden on the clinical staff, particularly in low-resource settings. The objective of our study is to develop an integrated online platform for efficient dementia screening, using a brief and cost-effective assessment. Methods: We used the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India dataset (LASI-DAD, n=2528) to predict dementia diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using feature selection algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA), we identified key predictive features. We compared the performance of six machine learning (ML) classifiers that were trained on the 42 selected features (full model) and the two components identified by PCA (minimal model). The best-performing model was selected for our web platform. Results: Selected features mapped onto two distinct, interpretable domains: a cognitive domain and an informant domain. The first two principal components cumulatively explained 90.2% of the variance and included questions from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Classifiers trained on the minimal model performed on par with the full model, with Support Vector Machine performing best (93.4%). The model did not reliably predict Parkinson disease (67% accuracy) or stroke (53.1% accuracy), suggesting dementia specificity. The respective questions from MMSE and IQCODE (27 items) were incorporated into our online platform. Conclusion: We built an online platform enabling end-to-end screening for dementia from assessment to prediction, based on patient and caregiver reports.

DesignBibliometric study. Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility. ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time. ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility C_LIO_LIJournals not currently indexed in MEDLINE had to be excluded as hand searching was not feasible for such a large sample of journals C_LIO_LIIts important to be cautious in generalising to all health journals from our sample C_LIO_LIOur study included analysis of an intervention (publication of the joint editorials in multiple journals) to increase coverage on climate change and health in health journals.

Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [\u0026ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants online search history for key words such as \"bullet train,\" \"highway,\" \"airplane,\" and \"wastewater.\" The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.\nSoil surveillance for monitoring soil-transmitted helminth infections: method development and field testing in three countries\nAuthors: Manuel, M.; Amato, H.; Pilotte, N.; Chieng, B.; Araka, S. B.; Siko, J.; Harris, M.; Nadimpalli, M.; Janagaraj, V.; Houngbegnon, P.; Rajendiran, R.; Thamburaj, J.; Kaliappan, S. P.; Sirois, A. R.; Walch, G.; Oswald, W.; Asbjörnsdottir, K.

R.; Pickering, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296174\nOne-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species. Detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations. SynopsisLimited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.\nIntimate partner violence and its correlates in middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-country secondary analysis\nAuthors: Chang, G.; Tucker, J.; Walker, K.; Chu, C.; Miall, N.; Tan, R.; Wu, D.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296197\nBackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey. MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data. ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p\u003c0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04). ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, but it is less clear what effect vaccines have on reducing the risk of infection in high contact settings like households, alone or in combination with prior infection.

MethodsHouseholds with an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Sep 2021-May 2023 were screened nationwide and at 7 sentinel sites and enrolled if the index cases illness onset was [&amp;le;]6 days prior. Household members had daily self-collected nasal swabs tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination status was assessed by plausible self-report (with date) or vaccination records. Prior infection was assessed by self-reported prior testing and by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies presence at enrollment. The effects of prior immunity, including vaccination, prior infection, or hybrid immunity (both vaccination and prior infection) on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among household contacts were assessed by robust, clustered multivariable Poisson regression.

FindingsThere were 1,532 contacts from 905 households included in this analysis. Of these, 67% were enrolled May-November 2022, when Omicron BA.4/5 predominated. Most contacts (89%) had some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of household exposure: 8% had immunity from prior infection alone, 51% from vaccination alone, and 29% had hybrid immunity. Sixty percent of contacts tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during follow-up. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly reduced by vaccination but was reduced among those with prior infection considering such immunity separately (adjusted relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.90); however, when accounting for both sources of immunity, only contacts with vaccination and prior infection had significantly reduced risk of infection (aRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.93). The risk of infection was lower when the last immunizing event (vaccination or infection) occurred [&amp;le;]6 months before COVID-19 affected the household (aRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83).

InterpretationImmunity from COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection was synergistic in protecting household contacts from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support COVID-19 vaccination, even for those who have been previously infected.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the terms (&#34;hybrid immunity&#34; or &#34;natural immunity&#34;) AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; or COVID*) in October of 2023 to identify previous research into the role of hybrid immunity (defined as immunity from prior infection and vaccination) in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We reviewed 512 articles for estimates of the association between hybrid immunity and susceptibility to illness, infection, or reinfection in humans. Multiple previous meta-analyses were identified, including a meta-regression from 2023 finding that hybrid immunity was associated with 61% reduction in risk of infection compared to immune-naive individuals 6 months after the immunizing event. The estimates included in this meta-regression were all published before June of 2022, prior to the widespread circulation of Omicron BA.4, BA.5, or recombinant lineages, and none reported on the risk of infection in a setting of household exposures.

Added value of the studyIn a pair of multi-site case-ascertained household transmission investigations with the majority of enrollments occurring during the Omicron BA4/5 predominant periods, the risk of infection among household contacts of a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. In a study design with systematic, daily testing of household contacts regardless of symptoms, serological verification of prior infection, and vaccine verification, the primary result of analyses of infection risk among household contacts was that this risk was lowest among those with hybrid immunity. The estimate of the magnitude of this protection was lower than in previous reports of protection in other settings.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household contacts was lowest among those with hybrid immunity, compared to those with no previous immunity, vaccination alone, or previous infection alone. These findings underscore the importance of staying updated with COVID-19 vaccinations, even for individuals with prior infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented.

MethodsWe worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined agespecific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019.

FindingsThe survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60&#43; years and 212 were women. At ages 60&#43; years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60&#43; years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1{middle dot}35 million excess deaths over the two months.

InterpretationChina experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Dementia screening tools typically involve face-to-face cognitive testing. Indeed, this introduces an increasing burden on the clinical staff, particularly in low-resource settings. The objective of our study is to develop an integrated online platform for efficient dementia screening, using a brief and cost-effective assessment. Methods: We used the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India dataset (LASI-DAD, n=2528) to predict dementia diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using feature selection algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA), we identified key predictive features. We compared the performance of six machine learning (ML) classifiers that were trained on the 42 selected features (full model) and the two components identified by PCA (minimal model). The best-performing model was selected for our web platform. Results: Selected features mapped onto two distinct, interpretable domains: a cognitive domain and an informant domain. The first two principal components cumulatively explained 90.2% of the variance and included questions from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Classifiers trained on the minimal model performed on par with the full model, with Support Vector Machine performing best (93.4%). The model did not reliably predict Parkinson disease (67% accuracy) or stroke (53.1% accuracy), suggesting dementia specificity. The respective questions from MMSE and IQCODE (27 items) were incorporated into our online platform. Conclusion: We built an online platform enabling end-to-end screening for dementia from assessment to prediction, based on patient and caregiver reports.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo find what proportion of a broad set of health journals have published on climate change and health, how many articles they have published, and when they first published on the subject.

DesignBibliometric study.

Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility.

ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time.

ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods
C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance is anticipated to be a representative and timely method to assess infectious disease status; however, its influence on public perception and behavior remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [&amp;ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants online search history for key words such as &#34;bullet train,&#34; &#34;highway,&#34; &#34;airplane,&#34; and &#34;wastewater.&#34; The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One-fifth of the global population is infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Mass drug administration (MDA) with deworming medication is widely implemented to control morbidity associated with STH infections. However, surveillance of human infection prevalence by collecting individual stool samples is time-consuming, costly, often stigmatized, and logistically challenging. Current methods of STH detection are poorly sensitive, particularly in low-intensity and low-prevalence populations. Here, we developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH DNA in large volumes of soil by conducting laboratory and proof of concept studies across field sites in Kenya, Benin, and India. We collected human stool (n=669) and soil (n= 478) from 322 households across the three study sites. The overall prevalence of STH in soil was 31% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 3% for T. trichuris, and 24% for any hookworm species. Detection of an STH species in household soil was strongly associated with increased odds of a household member being infected with that species. Soil surveillance for STH has several benefits over stool-based surveillance, including lower cost and higher success rates for sample collection. Considering that delivery of MDA occurs at the community level, environmental surveillance using molecular methods could be a cost-effective alternate strategy for monitoring STH in these populations.

SynopsisLimited data exists on the prevalence and reliability of environmental soil-transmitted helminth (STH) DNA as a marker of human infections in endemic populations. We developed a new molecular detection method for STH DNA in large-volume soil samples and field-tested it across three countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Middle-aged and older adults, ages 45 years or older, are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and social isolation. However, most studies on IPV during the pandemic do not focus on this important subpopulation. Informed by the social-ecological theory, this study examines individual, household, community, and country-level correlates of IPV among middle-aged and older adults in multiple countries using a cross-sectional online survey.

MethodsData from 2867 participants aged over 45 in the International Sexual Health and Reproductive Health (I-SHARE) survey from July 2020 to February 2021 were described using univariate analysis. IPV was defined using four validated WHO measures. Individual characteristics included self-isolation and food security. At the country-level, we examined social distancing stringency. Logistic regression models with a random intercept for country were conducted to explore IPV correlates among 1730 eligible individuals from 20 countries with complete data.

ResultsMost participants were heterosexual (2469/2867), cisgender (2531/2867) females (1589/2867) between the ages of 45-54 (1539/2867). 12.1% (346/2867) of participants experienced IPV during social distancing measures. After adjustment, participants who self-isolated experienced 1.4 (95% CI 1.0, 2.0, p=0.04) times the odds of IPV compared to those who had not isolated. Those who reported an increase in food insecurity compared to pre-pandemic experienced 2.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.6, 3.0, p&lt;0.0001) of IPV compared to those who did not report increased food insecurity. People in countries with more stringent social distancing policies were less likely to experience IPV compared to people in countries with lower levels of stringency (aOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.9, p=0.04).

ConclusionsIPV was common among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the need for further crisis management and social protection measures for middle-aged and older adults who have intersecting vulnerabilities to IPV to mitigate COVID-19 impact.</p>
