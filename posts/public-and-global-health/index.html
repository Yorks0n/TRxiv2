G.; Respiratory Virus Transmission Network Study Group, Score: 165.6, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.23297317\nBackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, but it is less clear what effect vaccines have on reducing the risk of infection in high contact settings like households, alone or in combination with prior infection. MethodsHouseholds with an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Sep 2021-May 2023 were screened nationwide and at 7 sentinel sites and enrolled if the index cases illness onset was [\u0026le;]6 days prior. Household members had daily self-collected nasal swabs tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination status was assessed by plausible self-report (with date) or vaccination records. Prior infection was assessed by self-reported prior testing and by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies presence at enrollment. The effects of prior immunity, including vaccination, prior infection, or hybrid immunity (both vaccination and prior infection) on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among household contacts were assessed by robust, clustered multivariable Poisson regression. FindingsThere were 1,532 contacts from 905 households included in this analysis. Of these, 67% were enrolled May-November 2022, when Omicron BA.4/5 predominated. Most contacts (89%) had some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of household exposure: 8% had immunity from prior infection alone, 51% from vaccination alone, and 29% had hybrid immunity. Sixty percent of contacts tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during follow-up. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly reduced by vaccination but was reduced among those with prior infection considering such immunity separately (adjusted relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.90); however, when accounting for both sources of immunity, only contacts with vaccination and prior infection had significantly reduced risk of infection (aRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.93). The risk of infection was lower when the last immunizing event (vaccination or infection) occurred [\u0026le;]6 months before COVID-19 affected the household (aRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83). InterpretationImmunity from COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection was synergistic in protecting household contacts from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support COVID-19 vaccination, even for those who have been previously infected. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the terms (\"hybrid immunity\" or \"natural immunity\") AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" or COVID*) in October of 2023 to identify previous research into the role of hybrid immunity (defined as immunity from prior infection and vaccination) in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We reviewed 512 articles for estimates of the association between hybrid immunity and susceptibility to illness, infection, or reinfection in humans. Multiple previous meta-analyses were identified, including a meta-regression from 2023 finding that hybrid immunity was associated with 61% reduction in risk of infection compared to immune-naive individuals 6 months after the immunizing event. The estimates included in this meta-regression were all published before June of 2022, prior to the widespread circulation of Omicron BA.4, BA.5, or recombinant lineages, and none reported on the risk of infection in a setting of household exposures. Added value of the studyIn a pair of multi-site case-ascertained household transmission investigations with the majority of enrollments occurring during the Omicron BA4/5 predominant periods, the risk of infection among household contacts of a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. In a study design with systematic, daily testing of household contacts regardless of symptoms, serological verification of prior infection, and vaccine verification, the primary result of analyses of infection risk among household contacts was that this risk was lowest among those with hybrid immunity. The estimate of the magnitude of this protection was lower than in previous reports of protection in other settings. Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household contacts was lowest among those with hybrid immunity, compared to those with no previous immunity, vaccination alone, or previous infection alone. These findings underscore the importance of staying updated with COVID-19 vaccinations, even for individuals with prior infection.\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S. L.; Howerton, E.; Contamin, L.; Smith, C. P.; Carcelen, E. C.; Yan, K.; Bents, S. J.; Espino, J.; Levander, J.; Reich, N. G.; Lemaitre, J. C.; Sato, K.; McKee, C. D.; Hill, A. L.; Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J. T.; Mu, K.; Vespignani, A.; Rosenstrom, E. T.; Rodriguez-Cartes, S. A.; Ivy, J. S.; Mayorga, M. E.; Swann, J. L.; Espana, G.; Cavany, S.; Moore, S. M.; Perkins, A.; Chen, S.; Paul, R.; Janies, D.; Thill, J.-C.; Srivastava, A.; Aawar, M. A.; Bi, K.; Bandekar, S. R.; Bouchnita, A.; Fox, S. J.; Meyers, L. A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; H\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportance: COVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. Objective: To project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). Design: The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. Setting: The entire United States. Participants: None. Exposure: Annually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measures: Ensemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. Results: From April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.\nIn praise of fossil fuel subsidies (for cooking)\nAuthors: Gould, C. F.; Bailis, R.; Balakrishnan, K.; Burke, M.; Espinoza, S.; Mehta, S.; Schlesinger, S.; Suarez-Lopez, J.; Pillarisetti, A.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297550\nWe use three quantitative case studies to argue that ubiquitous and universal condemnation of fossil fuel subsidies is myopic and does not adequately consider subsidizing gas for cooking as a potential strategy to improve public health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ecuador offers a view into the long-run impacts of gas subsidies, having made historical investments in subsidizing gas for cooking that led to widespread use that outpaces peer nations. We calculate that the subsidy likely averted 100,000 premature deaths with benefits that outweigh costs four to one. India successfully implemented the largest gas cooking access program in the world, but the level of subsidies provided by the government has varied. We estimate that mortality and climate benefits from maintaining varying levels of the gas subsidy between 2023-2030 will be roughly double costs. In Kenya, removing a value added tax on LPG will yield health and climate benefits that will dwarf the lost revenue by ~30x. Waiting for existing policies and momentum to move households toward near-exclusive clean fuel use forces marginalized populations to directly face the health, environmental, and socio-economic harms of traditional cooking. Rather than wait decades for development to provide clean cooking to these households, which will deepen health and energy inequities, we suggest that targeted LPG subsidies offer a solution available today and provide immediate health and climate benefits.\nIschemic Stroke after Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccination: A Self-Controlled Case Series Study\nAuthors: Xu, S.; Sy, L. S.; Hong, V.; Holmquist, K. J.; Qian, L.; Farrington, P.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Klein, N. P.; Fireman, B.; Han, B.; Lewin, B. J.\nScore: 151.5, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nExcess deaths in China during SARS-CoV-2 viral waves in 2022-2023\nAuthors: Jha, P.; Brown, P. E.; Lam, T.; Morawski, E.; Reid, A.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.23297204\nBackgroundThe extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented. MethodsWe worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined agespecific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019. FindingsThe survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60+ years and 212 were women. At ages 60+ years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60+ years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1{middle dot}35 million excess deaths over the two months. InterpretationChina experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.

S.; Owoade, P.; Toniolo, S.; Dehsarvi, A.; Rathee, S.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297405\nBackgroundDementia screening tools typically involve face-to-face cognitive testing. Indeed, this introduces an increasing burden on the clinical staff, particularly in low-resource settings. The objective of our study is to develop an integrated online platform for efficient dementia screening, using a brief and cost-effective assessment. MethodsWe used the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India dataset (LASI-DAD, n=2528) to predict dementia diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using feature selection algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA), we identified key predictive features. We compared the performance of six machine learning (ML) classifiers that were trained on the 42 selected features (full model) and the two components identified by PCA (minimal model). The best-performing model was selected for our web platform. ResultsSelected features mapped onto two distinct, interpretable domains: a cognitive domain and an informant domain. The first two principal components cumulatively explained 90.2% of the variance and included questions from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Classifiers trained on the minimal model performed on par with the full model, with Support Vector Machine performing best (93.4%). The model did not reliably predict Parkinsons disease (67% accuracy) or stroke (53.1% accuracy), suggesting dementia specificity. The respective questions from MMSE and IQCODE (27 items) were incorporated into our online platform. ConclusionWe built an online platform enabling end-to-end screening for dementia from assessment to prediction, based on patient and caregiver reports.

DesignBibliometric study. Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility. ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time. ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility C_LIO_LIJournals not currently indexed in MEDLINE had to be excluded as hand searching was not feasible for such a large sample of journals C_LIO_LIIts important to be cautious in generalising to all health journals from our sample C_LIO_LIOur study included analysis of an intervention (publication of the joint editorials in multiple journals) to increase coverage on climate change and health in health journals.

Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [\u0026ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants online search history for key words such as \"bullet train,\" \"highway,\" \"airplane,\" and \"wastewater.\" The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.\nNavigating vaccination choices: The intersecting dynamics of institutional trust, belonging and message perception among Congolese migrants in the UK (A reflexive thematic analysis)\nAuthors: Crawshaw, A.; Vandrevala, T.; Knights, F.; Deal, A.; Lutumba, L. M.; Kitoko, L. M.; Nkembi, S. L.; Hickey, C.; Forster, A.; Hargreaves, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297575\nBackground The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted intersectionally marginalised migrants, revealing systemic disparities in health outcomes and vaccine uptake. An in-depth understanding of the underlying social and structural factors influencing health behaviours is necessary to develop tailored interventions for migrants but has been seldom explored. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to explore the contextual factors shaping COVID-19 vaccination decision-making among Congolese migrants in the UK. Methods A community-based participatory research study was designed and led by a community-academic partnership in London, UK (2021-2022). Peer-led, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Lingala with 32 adult Congolese migrants and explored beliefs, perceptions and lived experiences of migration, healthcare and vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflexive thematic analysis generated two themes and a model conceptualising the vaccination decision-making process was developed. Participants and community partners were financially compensated, and the study received ethical approval from the University of London ethics committee (REC: 2021.0128). Findings Participants highlighted the incompatibility of lockdown restrictions with their communal culture, which intensified feelings of exclusion and alienation. They expressed concerns about COVID-19 vaccination safety and effectiveness, partly informed by experiences and legacies of discrimination and exploitation of Black Africans. Inequality in the pandemic response and COVID-19 outcomes heightened participants sense that their views and needs were being overlooked; accordingly, government sources and information were perceived as coercive and untrustworthy. Drawing on this data, our model depicts the interplay between institutional trust, belonging, and message perception which shaped participants vaccination decisions and led to (non-)engagement with COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion This research enhances understanding of how social and contextual factors may influence migrants engagement with health interventions. It underscores the necessity of partnering with migrant communities to understand their needs in context and co-design tailored interventions and inclusive messaging strategies which foster trust and belonging. Implementing systemic changes to address structural inequalities will be crucial to create an environment that supports engagement with health-protective behaviours and enhances health outcomes among migrant communities.\nBarriers and Facilitators for the Use of Telehealth by Healthcare Providers (HCP) in India - A Scoping Review\nAuthors: Sharma, P.; Rao, S.; Krishna Kumar, P.; R Nair, A.; Agrawal, D.; Zadey, S.; Surendran, G.; George Joseph, R.; Dayma, G.; Rafeekh, L.; Saha, S.; Sharma, S.; Prakash, S.; Sankarapandian, V.; John, P.; Patel, V.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297653\nBackground: It is widely assumed that telehealth tools like mHealth, telemedicine, and tele-education can supplement the efficiency of Healthcare Providers (HCPs). We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the barriers and facilitators associated with the use of telehealth by HCPs in India. Methods: A systematic literature search following a pre-registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ3U9 [PROTOCOL DOI]) was conducted in PubMed. The search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria were based on the World Health Organizations action framework on Human Resources for Health (HRH) and Universal Health Coverage in India with a specific focus on telehealth tools. Eligible articles published in English from 1st January 2001 to 17th February 2022 were included. Results: One hundred and six studies were included in the review. Of these, 53 studies (50%) involved mHealth interventions, 25 (23.6%) involved telemedicine interventions whereas the remaining 28 (26.4%) involved the use of tele-education interventions by HCPs in India. In each category, most of the studies followed a quantitative study design and were mostly published in the last 5 years. The study sites were more commonly present in states present in south India. The facilitators and barriers related to each type of intervention were analyzed under the following sub-headings- 1) Human resource related, 2) Application related 3) Technical, and 4) Others. The interventions were most commonly used for improving the management of mental health, non-communicable diseases, and maternal and child health. Conclusions: Use of telehealth has not been uniformly studied in India. The facilitators and barriers to telehealth use need to be kept in mind while designing the intervention. Future studies should focus on looking at region-specific, intervention-specific, and health cadre-specific barriers and facilitators for the use of telehealth.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, but it is less clear what effect vaccines have on reducing the risk of infection in high contact settings like households, alone or in combination with prior infection.

MethodsHouseholds with an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Sep 2021-May 2023 were screened nationwide and at 7 sentinel sites and enrolled if the index cases illness onset was [&amp;le;]6 days prior. Household members had daily self-collected nasal swabs tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination status was assessed by plausible self-report (with date) or vaccination records. Prior infection was assessed by self-reported prior testing and by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies presence at enrollment. The effects of prior immunity, including vaccination, prior infection, or hybrid immunity (both vaccination and prior infection) on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among household contacts were assessed by robust, clustered multivariable Poisson regression.

FindingsThere were 1,532 contacts from 905 households included in this analysis. Of these, 67% were enrolled May-November 2022, when Omicron BA.4/5 predominated. Most contacts (89%) had some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of household exposure: 8% had immunity from prior infection alone, 51% from vaccination alone, and 29% had hybrid immunity. Sixty percent of contacts tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during follow-up. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly reduced by vaccination but was reduced among those with prior infection considering such immunity separately (adjusted relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.90); however, when accounting for both sources of immunity, only contacts with vaccination and prior infection had significantly reduced risk of infection (aRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.93). The risk of infection was lower when the last immunizing event (vaccination or infection) occurred [&amp;le;]6 months before COVID-19 affected the household (aRR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83).

InterpretationImmunity from COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection was synergistic in protecting household contacts from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data support COVID-19 vaccination, even for those who have been previously infected.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the terms (&#34;hybrid immunity&#34; or &#34;natural immunity&#34;) AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; or COVID*) in October of 2023 to identify previous research into the role of hybrid immunity (defined as immunity from prior infection and vaccination) in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We reviewed 512 articles for estimates of the association between hybrid immunity and susceptibility to illness, infection, or reinfection in humans. Multiple previous meta-analyses were identified, including a meta-regression from 2023 finding that hybrid immunity was associated with 61% reduction in risk of infection compared to immune-naive individuals 6 months after the immunizing event. The estimates included in this meta-regression were all published before June of 2022, prior to the widespread circulation of Omicron BA.4, BA.5, or recombinant lineages, and none reported on the risk of infection in a setting of household exposures.

Added value of the studyIn a pair of multi-site case-ascertained household transmission investigations with the majority of enrollments occurring during the Omicron BA4/5 predominant periods, the risk of infection among household contacts of a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. In a study design with systematic, daily testing of household contacts regardless of symptoms, serological verification of prior infection, and vaccine verification, the primary result of analyses of infection risk among household contacts was that this risk was lowest among those with hybrid immunity. The estimate of the magnitude of this protection was lower than in previous reports of protection in other settings.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household contacts was lowest among those with hybrid immunity, compared to those with no previous immunity, vaccination alone, or previous infection alone. These findings underscore the importance of staying updated with COVID-19 vaccinations, even for individuals with prior infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Importance: COVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. Objective: To project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups). Design: The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. Setting: The entire United States. Participants: None. Exposure: Annually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measures: Ensemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. Results: From April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We use three quantitative case studies to argue that ubiquitous and universal condemnation of fossil fuel subsidies is myopic and does not adequately consider subsidizing gas for cooking as a potential strategy to improve public health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ecuador offers a view into the long-run impacts of gas subsidies, having made historical investments in subsidizing gas for cooking that led to widespread use that outpaces peer nations. We calculate that the subsidy likely averted 100,000 premature deaths with benefits that outweigh costs four to one. India successfully implemented the largest gas cooking access program in the world, but the level of subsidies provided by the government has varied. We estimate that mortality and climate benefits from maintaining varying levels of the gas subsidy between 2023-2030 will be roughly double costs. In Kenya, removing a value added tax on LPG will yield health and climate benefits that will dwarf the lost revenue by ~30x. Waiting for existing policies and momentum to move households toward near-exclusive clean fuel use forces marginalized populations to directly face the health, environmental, and socio-economic harms of traditional cooking. Rather than wait decades for development to provide clean cooking to these households, which will deepen health and energy inequities, we suggest that targeted LPG subsidies offer a solution available today and provide immediate health and climate benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe extent to which the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 raised death rates in China during its viral wave of December 2022-January 2023 remains undocumented.

MethodsWe worked with an established national survey organization to survey 8,004 adults in all 31 administrative areas of China to ask about deaths in families since January 2020. We examined agespecific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to the United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019.

FindingsThe survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60&#43; years and 212 were women. At ages 60&#43; years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022-January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60&#43; years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China had approximately 1{middle dot}35 million excess deaths over the two months.

InterpretationChina experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDementia screening tools typically involve face-to-face cognitive testing. Indeed, this introduces an increasing burden on the clinical staff, particularly in low-resource settings. The objective of our study is to develop an integrated online platform for efficient dementia screening, using a brief and cost-effective assessment.

MethodsWe used the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India dataset (LASI-DAD, n=2528) to predict dementia diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using feature selection algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA), we identified key predictive features. We compared the performance of six machine learning (ML) classifiers that were trained on the 42 selected features (full model) and the two components identified by PCA (minimal model). The best-performing model was selected for our web platform.

ResultsSelected features mapped onto two distinct, interpretable domains: a cognitive domain and an informant domain. The first two principal components cumulatively explained 90.2% of the variance and included questions from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Classifiers trained on the minimal model performed on par with the full model, with Support Vector Machine performing best (93.4%). The model did not reliably predict Parkinsons disease (67% accuracy) or stroke (53.1% accuracy), suggesting dementia specificity. The respective questions from MMSE and IQCODE (27 items) were incorporated into our online platform.

ConclusionWe built an online platform enabling end-to-end screening for dementia from assessment to prediction, based on patient and caregiver reports.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo find what proportion of a broad set of health journals have published on climate change and health, how many articles they have published, and when they first published on the subject.

DesignBibliometric study.

Setting and particbipantsWe conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility.

ResultsAfter screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the US. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time.

ConclusionsHealth journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe looked at coverage of climate change at both the article and journal level from 1860 to 2022; previous bibliometric studies have analysed results only at the article level and in restricted time periods
C_LIO_LITwo independent raters screened the title and abstract (where available) of every article identified by the MEDLINE search to assess eligibility
C_LIO_LIJournals not currently indexed in MEDLINE had to be excluded as hand searching was not feasible for such a large sample of journals
C_LIO_LIIts important to be cautious in generalising to all health journals from our sample
C_LIO_LIOur study included analysis of an intervention (publication of the joint editorials in multiple journals) to increase coverage on climate change and health in health journals.

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance is anticipated to be a representative and timely method to assess infectious disease status; however, its influence on public perception and behavior remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we used a randomized controlled trial to analyze the influence of wastewater surveillance-based information on understanding of, interest in, relief regarding, preventive behavioral intention against, and subsequent online search behavior related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Valid responses were obtained from 1,000 individuals in both control and intervention groups from Yahoo crowdsourcing users aged [&amp;ge;]18 years in Japan. This survey was conducted from August 4 to August 7, 2023, just before the common Japanese tradition of returning to hometowns. The questionnaire not only collected personal attributes but also gauged responses to COVID-19 information. This information highlighted the early detection capabilities and representativeness of wastewater surveillance compared with sentinel surveillance at medical institutions. At one-week post-survey, we obtained the survey participants online search history for key words such as &#34;bullet train,&#34; &#34;highway,&#34; &#34;airplane,&#34; and &#34;wastewater.&#34; The findings showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 interest or preventive behavior before information provision, verifying the effectiveness of participant randomization. Wastewater surveillance-based information did not notably elevate understanding or specific intentions regarding COVID-19, such as wearing masks and receiving vaccination. However, it significantly increased interest in, relief concerning the infection status, and general preventive behavioral intentions. Heightened interest and general preventive intentions did not depend on prior interest or behavior. However, those who previously engaged in preventive behavior or who were less interested in COVID-19 exhibited more relief after exposure to wastewater surveillance-based information. Furthermore, this information could slightly influence online searches related to return travel modes, such as highways. In conclusion, information from wastewater surveillance effectively shapes individual perceptions of and responses to infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted intersectionally marginalised migrants, revealing systemic disparities in health outcomes and vaccine uptake. An in-depth understanding of the underlying social and structural factors influencing health behaviours is necessary to develop tailored interventions for migrants but has been seldom explored. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to explore the contextual factors shaping COVID-19 vaccination decision-making among Congolese migrants in the UK.        Methods A community-based participatory research study was designed and led by a community-academic partnership in London, UK (2021-2022). Peer-led, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Lingala with 32 adult Congolese migrants and explored beliefs, perceptions and lived experiences of migration, healthcare and vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflexive thematic analysis generated two themes and a model conceptualising the vaccination decision-making process was developed. Participants and community partners were financially compensated, and the study received ethical approval from the University of London ethics committee (REC: 2021.0128). Findings Participants highlighted the incompatibility of lockdown restrictions with their communal culture, which intensified feelings of exclusion and alienation. They expressed concerns about COVID-19 vaccination safety and effectiveness, partly informed by experiences and legacies of discrimination and exploitation of Black Africans. Inequality in the pandemic response and COVID-19 outcomes heightened participants sense that their views and needs were being overlooked; accordingly, government sources and information were perceived as coercive and untrustworthy. Drawing on this data, our model depicts the interplay between institutional trust, belonging, and message perception which shaped participants vaccination decisions and led to (non-)engagement with COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion This research enhances understanding of how social and contextual factors may influence migrants engagement with health interventions. It underscores the necessity of partnering with migrant communities to understand their needs in context and co-design tailored interventions and inclusive messaging strategies which foster trust and belonging. Implementing systemic changes to address structural inequalities will be crucial to create an environment that supports engagement with health-protective behaviours and enhances health outcomes among migrant communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: It is widely assumed that telehealth tools like mHealth, telemedicine, and tele-education can supplement the efficiency of Healthcare Providers (HCPs). We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the barriers and facilitators associated with the use of telehealth by HCPs in India.   Methods: A systematic literature search following a pre-registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ3U9 [PROTOCOL DOI]) was conducted in PubMed. The search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria were based on the World Health Organizations action framework on Human Resources for Health (HRH) and Universal Health Coverage in India with a specific focus on telehealth tools. Eligible articles published in English from 1st January 2001 to 17th February 2022 were included. Results: One hundred and six studies were included in the review. Of these,  53 studies (50%) involved mHealth interventions, 25 (23.6%) involved telemedicine interventions whereas the remaining 28 (26.4%) involved the use of tele-education interventions by HCPs in India. In each category, most of the studies followed a  quantitative study design and were mostly published in the last 5 years. The study sites were more commonly present in states present in south India. The facilitators and barriers related to each type of intervention were analyzed under the following sub-headings- 1) Human resource related, 2) Application related 3) Technical, and 4) Others. The interventions were most commonly used for improving the management of mental health, non-communicable diseases, and maternal and child health.   Conclusions: Use of telehealth has not been uniformly studied in India. The facilitators and barriers to telehealth use need to be kept in mind while designing the intervention. Future studies should focus on looking at region-specific, intervention-specific, and health cadre-specific barriers and facilitators for the use of telehealth.</p>
