This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid. MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration. FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources. ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma. Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.\nThe Mortality Burden from COVID in Low-Income Settings: Evidence from Verbal Autopsies in India\nAuthors: Malani, A.; Zhao, W.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300728\nMeasuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.\nReduction in State Specific Influenza Mortality During the COVID Pandemic and Its Association with Political Preference\nAuthors: Morris, R. D.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39). ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.\nThe remarkable ups and downs of birth rate in Switzerland 2020 to 2023 in a historical context\nAuthors: Le Vu, M.; Matthes, K. L.; Staub, K.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299432\nWe follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among \u003e30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.\nAssessing the effectiveness of near real-time flow cytometry in monitoring ozone disinfection in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant\nAuthors: Dowdell, K. S.; Olsen, K.; Martinez Paz, E. F.; Sun, A.; Keown, J.; Lahr, R.; Steglitz, B.; Busch, A.; LiPuma, J. J.; Olson, T.; Raskin, L.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300640\nWhile real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendalls tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendalls tau=0.40, p\u003c0.01), HPC (Kendalls tau=0.20, p\u003c0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendalls tau=0.30, p\u003c0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p\u003c0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.

Z.; Mpinganjira, S.; Sibongile Nkosi, D.; Chido Konono, K. C.; Ngigi, M.; Ongolo-Zogo, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300795\nIntroductionThe emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has affected countries worldwide, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC has experienced four waves of COVID-19, each associated with a new variant of the virus. To control the spread of the virus, the government of the DRC implemented various measures, including vaccination. The country developed a COVID-19 vaccine deployment plan, targeting high-risk groups, and launched a vaccination campaign in April 2021. This study aims to comprehensively assess the COVID-19 vaccination program in the DRC during its first year of implementation, including progress, coverage, types of vaccines administered, and a comparison with other neighboring countries. MethodsThis study was an analysis of the COVID-19 vaccination data during its first year of implementation in DRC. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the Ministry of Health and the WHO, and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study received clearance and used de-identified and aggregated data. ResultsOut of the 26 provinces in the country, only 15 began immunization activities with varying levels of coverage, ranging from 0.02% to 6.91%. The number of functional vaccination sites remained patchy across the country. By March 2022, 5.7% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose, with 1.03% fully vaccinated. In most provinces, men were more compliant with vaccination than women. More than half of the vaccinated individuals preferred the Janssen vaccine. Compared to neighboring countries, the DRC has lagged behind in its vaccination efforts, having administered only 1.1 million of doses received (8%) and has vaccinated only 2% of its population with at least one dose, the lowest among the countries analyzed. ConclusionDespite the challenges faced in the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination, DRC has made significant progress in vaccinating its population. The slow progress highlights the need for continued investment in health systems. These insights can inform future Covid-19 vaccination campaigns in DRC and other low-income countries.\nRacial Differences in the Relationship Between Blood Pressure and Cognitive Decline\nAuthors: Oliver, M. D.; Morrison, C.; El-Hulu, S.; Harvey, M.; Barnes, L. L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300811\nBackgroundCognition may be influenced by health-related factors such as blood pressure (BP). However, variations in BP may differentially affect cognition as a function of race. This study investigates the relationship between normal, high, and variable BP and cognitive decline in older Black and White adults. Methods2284 participants (1139 Blacks, 1145 Whites, MAge=73.4, SD=6.6) from 3 harmonized cohorts of older adults from the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center, were divided into 3 groups (normal, high, variable) based on systolic BP mean and standard deviation. Cognitive scores were computed from multiple assessments in 5 domains (i.e., episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability). Performance across 19 tests were averaged to create a measure of global cognition. Linear mixed-effects models examined racial differences between BP and cognitive change over an average of 6.7 years. ResultsWhite adults with high or variable BP had faster rates of decline in global cognition compared to Black adults. White adults with high BP declined faster in perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory compared to Black adults with high BP, whereas White adults with variable BP had faster rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to Black adults with variable BP. No racial differences were observed in individuals with normal BP. ConclusionsWhite older adults with elevated or fluctuating BP show faster rates of cognitive decline compared to older Black adults. Findings highlight the complex interplay between BP and cognitive health, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to address racial disparities in cognitive well-being.\nPrevalence, risk factors and clinical presentations of post-COVID-19 condition: a follow-up study of reported COVID-19 infections in Montreal, Canada.\nAuthors: Allard, R.; Balegamire, S. J.; Malloum, K. B.; Cantalino, J.; Signor, C.; Leclerc, P.; Bergeron, G.; Mercure, S.-A.; Cadieux, G.\nScore: 152.4, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300022\nBackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [\u0026ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.\nSubstance use and overdose in Pennsylvania libraries, 2019\nAuthors: Feuerstein-Simon, R.; Lowenstein, M.; Szapary, C.; Torres, O.; Dolan, A. R.; Jalloh, A.; Meisel, Z. F.; Cannuscio, C. C.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300786\nThis study examines the implementation of naloxone distribution initiatives in Pennsylvania public libraries following a nationwide program offering free Narcan. We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey with a random sample of Pennsylvania public libraries (n=352). Overall, nearly one-quarter of respondents reported stocking naloxone (23.9%), and over one in ten libraries reported a previous on-site overdose (11.9%). Nearly 30% of respondents had received naloxone training. Significant predictors of on-site overdoses included the librarys county urbanization status and higher county-level overdose mortality rates. Among libraries that stocked naloxone, 73% obtained the medication from local health departments or community-based organizations. This study underscores the role of public libraries in opioid overdose crisis response and the need for tailored strategies to enhance naloxone accessibility, especially in high-risk urban areas. Collaboration between libraries, public health entities, and pharmaceutical companies is crucial to amplify naloxone distribution efforts and address the escalating opioid overdose crisis.\nEnsemble Learning: Predicting Human Pathogenicity of Hematophagous Arthropod Vector-Borne Viruses\nAuthors: Hu, H.; Zhao, C.; Jin, M.; Chen, J.; Liu, X.; Guo, J.; Shi, H.; Wang, C.; Chen, Y.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300660\nHematophagous arthropods occupy a pivotal role in ecosystems, serving as vectors for a wide array of pathogens with significant implications for public health. Their capacity to harbor and transmit viruses through biting actions creates a substantial risk of zoonotic spillover. Despite the advancements in metagenomic approaches for virus discovery in vectors, the isolation and cultivation of viruses still pose significant challenges, thereby limiting comprehensive assessments of their pathogenicity. Here, we curated two datasets: one with 294 viruses, characterized by 37 epidemiological features, encompassing virus information and host associations; the second with 71,622 sequences of hematophagous arthropod vector-borne viruses, annotated with 33 sequence features. Two XGBoost models were developed to predict arbovirus human pathogenicity--one integrating macroscopic eco-epidemiological data, the other incorporating virus-related sequence features. The macroscopic model identified non-vector host transmission as a key determinant, especially involving Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora Order. The sequence-based model demonstrated that viral adhesion and viral invasion had distinct trends with consistent increase and decrease in the likelihood of virus pathogenicity to humans, respectively. With validated through an independent dataset, the model exhibited a congruous alignment with documented pathogenicity outcomes. Together, the models offer a holistic framework for assessing the pathogenic potential of viruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimLong Covid can be a stigmatising condition, particularly in people who are disadvantaged within society. This may prevent them seeking help and could lead to widening health inequalities. This co-produced study with a Community Advisory Board of people with Long Covid aimed to understand healthcare and wider barriers and stigma experienced by people with probable Long Covid.

MethodsAn active case finding approach was employed to find adults with probable, but not yet clinically diagnosed, Long Covid in two localities in London (Camden and Merton) and Derbyshire, England. Interviews explored the barriers to care, and the stigma faced by participants and analysed thematically. This study forms part of the STIMULATE-ICP Collaboration.

FindingsTwenty-three interviews were completed. Participants reported limited awareness of what Long Covid is and the available pathways to management. There was considerable self-doubt among participants, sometimes reinforced by interactions with healthcare professionals. Participants questioned their deservedness of seeking healthcare support for their symptoms. Hesitancy to engage with healthcare services was motivated by fear of needing more investigation and concerns regarding judgement about ability to carry out caregiving responsibilities. It was also motivated by the complexity of the clinical presentation and fear of all symptoms being attributed to poor mental health. Participants also reported trying to avoid overburdening the health system. These difficulties were compounded by experiences of stigma and discrimination. The emerging themes reaffirmed a framework of epistemic injustice in relation to Long Covid, where creating, interpreting, and conveying knowledge has varied credibility based on the tellers identity characteristics and/or the level of their interpretive resources.

ConclusionWe have developed recommendations based on the findings. These include early signposting to services, dedicating protected time to listen to people with Long Covid, providing a holistic approach in care pathways, and working to mitigate stigma. Regardless of the diagnosis, people experiencing new symptoms must be encouraged to seek timely medical help. Clear public health messaging is needed among communities already disadvantaged by epistemic injustice to raise awareness of Long Covid, and to share stories that encourage seeking care and to illustrate the adverse effects of stigma.

Patient or Public ContributionThis study was co-produced with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) made up of twenty-three members including healthcare professionals, people with lived experience of Long Covid and other stakeholders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Measuring the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 in lower-income countries is difficult because death registries are incomplete and lack cause of death. We address this problem in India, which had the second-highest number of officially reported cases. We completed WHO-compliant verbal autopsy (VA) surveys on roughly 20,000 deaths drawn from a population-representative sample. SARS-CoV-2 deaths spike in June 2020, just after Indias lockdown, and in May 2021, after its second wave. During those spikes the virus is responsible for 23.3% and 35.8% of all deaths, respectively. Cardiovascular deaths also spike during the start of the pandemic. We find that the death rate rises by 81% during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for 33% of these excess deaths, and cardiovascular disease for 23% of these deaths.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention easily and directly. We do, however, have historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us with an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, total influenza mortality declined by 80 percent relative to historical levels. Pediatric influenza morality decreased by 85 percent. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden (r2=0.39).

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these NPIs also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs was highly correlated with the political leanings of each state, suggesting that politics influenced the effectiveness of and/or compliance with NPI strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births {bsim}9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among &gt;30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulat-ing too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the in-crease before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advance-ment of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination pro-gram. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better under-stand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While real-time monitoring of physicochemical parameters has widely been incorporated into drinking water treatment systems, real-time microbial monitoring has lagged behind, resulting in the use of surrogate parameters (disinfectant residual, applied dose, concentration x time [CT]) to assess disinfection system performance. Near real-time flow cytometry (NRT-FCM) allows for automated quantification of total and intact microbial cells but has not been widely implemented in full-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of NRT-FCM for full-scale drinking water ozone disinfection system performance monitoring. A water treatment plant with high lime solids turbidity in the ozone contactor influent was selected to evaluate the NRT-FCM in challenging conditions. Total and intact cell counts were monitored for 40 days and compared to surrogate parameters (ozone residual, ozone dose, and CT) and grab sample assay results for cellular adenosine triphosphate (cATP), heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), impedance flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NRT-FCM provided insight into the dynamics of the full-scale ozone system, including offering early warning of increased contactor effluent cell concentrations, which was not observed using surrogate measures. A strong correlation between log intact cell removal and CT was also not observed (Kendalls tau= -0.09, p=0.04). Positive correlations were observed between intact cell counts and cATP levels (Kendalls tau=0.40, p&lt;0.01), HPC (Kendalls tau=0.20, p&lt;0.01), and impedance flow cytometry results (Kendalls tau=0.30, p&lt;0.01). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that passage through the ozone contactor significantly changed the microbial community (p&lt;0.05), supporting the hypothesis that regrowth was occurring in the later chambers of the contactor. This study demonstrates the utility of direct, near real-time microbial analysis for monitoring full-scale disinfection systems.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has affected countries worldwide, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC has experienced four waves of COVID-19, each associated with a new variant of the virus. To control the spread of the virus, the government of the DRC implemented various measures, including vaccination. The country developed a COVID-19 vaccine deployment plan, targeting high-risk groups, and launched a vaccination campaign in April 2021. This study aims to comprehensively assess the COVID-19 vaccination program in the DRC during its first year of implementation, including progress, coverage, types of vaccines administered, and a comparison with other neighboring countries.

MethodsThis study was an analysis of the COVID-19 vaccination data during its first year of implementation in DRC. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the Ministry of Health and the WHO, and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study received clearance and used de-identified and aggregated data.

ResultsOut of the 26 provinces in the country, only 15 began immunization activities with varying levels of coverage, ranging from 0.02% to 6.91%. The number of functional vaccination sites remained patchy across the country. By March 2022, 5.7% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose, with 1.03% fully vaccinated. In most provinces, men were more compliant with vaccination than women. More than half of the vaccinated individuals preferred the Janssen vaccine. Compared to neighboring countries, the DRC has lagged behind in its vaccination efforts, having administered only 1.1 million of doses received (8%) and has vaccinated only 2% of its population with at least one dose, the lowest among the countries analyzed.

ConclusionDespite the challenges faced in the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination, DRC has made significant progress in vaccinating its population. The slow progress highlights the need for continued investment in health systems. These insights can inform future Covid-19 vaccination campaigns in DRC and other low-income countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognition may be influenced by health-related factors such as blood pressure (BP). However, variations in BP may differentially affect cognition as a function of race. This study investigates the relationship between normal, high, and variable BP and cognitive decline in older Black and White adults.

Methods2284 participants (1139 Blacks, 1145 Whites, MAge=73.4, SD=6.6) from 3 harmonized cohorts of older adults from the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center, were divided into 3 groups (normal, high, variable) based on systolic BP mean and standard deviation. Cognitive scores were computed from multiple assessments in 5 domains (i.e., episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability). Performance across 19 tests were averaged to create a measure of global cognition. Linear mixed-effects models examined racial differences between BP and cognitive change over an average of 6.7 years.

ResultsWhite adults with high or variable BP had faster rates of decline in global cognition compared to Black adults. White adults with high BP declined faster in perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory compared to Black adults with high BP, whereas White adults with variable BP had faster rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to Black adults with variable BP. No racial differences were observed in individuals with normal BP.

ConclusionsWhite older adults with elevated or fluctuating BP show faster rates of cognitive decline compared to older Black adults. Findings highlight the complex interplay between BP and cognitive health, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to address racial disparities in cognitive well-being.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMeta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization.

MethodsFollow-up study by telephone re-interview, [&amp;ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress.

ResultsOf a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6).

InterpretationOur findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study examines the implementation of naloxone distribution initiatives in Pennsylvania public libraries following a nationwide program offering free Narcan. We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey with a random sample of Pennsylvania public libraries (n=352). Overall, nearly one-quarter of respondents reported stocking naloxone (23.9%), and over one in ten libraries reported a previous on-site overdose (11.9%). Nearly 30% of respondents had received naloxone training. Significant predictors of on-site overdoses included the librarys county urbanization status and higher county-level overdose mortality rates. Among libraries that stocked naloxone, 73% obtained the medication from local health departments or community-based organizations. This study underscores the role of public libraries in opioid overdose crisis response and the need for tailored strategies to enhance naloxone accessibility, especially in high-risk urban areas. Collaboration between libraries, public health entities, and pharmaceutical companies is crucial to amplify naloxone distribution efforts and address the escalating opioid overdose crisis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematophagous arthropods occupy a pivotal role in ecosystems, serving as vectors for a wide array of pathogens with significant implications for public health. Their capacity to harbor and transmit viruses through biting actions creates a substantial risk of zoonotic spillover. Despite the advancements in metagenomic approaches for virus discovery in vectors, the isolation and cultivation of viruses still pose significant challenges, thereby limiting comprehensive assessments of their pathogenicity. Here, we curated two datasets: one with 294 viruses, characterized by 37 epidemiological features, encompassing virus information and host associations; the second with 71,622 sequences of hematophagous arthropod vector-borne viruses, annotated with 33 sequence features. Two XGBoost models were developed to predict arbovirus human pathogenicity--one integrating macroscopic eco-epidemiological data, the other incorporating virus-related sequence features. The macroscopic model identified non-vector host transmission as a key determinant, especially involving Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora Order. The sequence-based model demonstrated that viral adhesion and viral invasion had distinct trends with consistent increase and decrease in the likelihood of virus pathogenicity to humans, respectively. With validated through an independent dataset, the model exhibited a congruous alignment with documented pathogenicity outcomes. Together, the models offer a holistic framework for assessing the pathogenic potential of viruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods.</p>
