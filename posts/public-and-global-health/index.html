To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths. ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths. ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death. FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council. Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022? Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow). Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.\nmRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years\nAuthors: Aglipay, M.; Maguire, J.

ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR. ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization. ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [\u0026ge;]7 days after the second dose. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.\nSelf-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality\nAuthors: Yuan, H.; Plekhanova, T.; Walmsley, R.; Reynolds, A. C.; Maddison, K. J.; Bucan, M.; Gehrman, P.; Rowlands, A.; Ray, D. W.; Bennett, D.; McVeigh, J.; Straker, L.; Eastwood, P.; Kyle, S. D.; Doherty, A.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292251\nBackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (\u003c6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77). InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included \"wearable\", \"actigraphy\" or \"accelerometer\" in combination with \"sleep stage\" or \"sleep classification\", and \"polysomnography\". Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n\u003c100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes. Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies. Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.\nChatGPT sits the DFPH exam: large language model performance and potential to support public health learning\nAuthors: Davies, N. P.; Wilson, R.; Winder, M. S.; Tunster, S. J.; McVicar, K.; Thakrar, S. T.; Williams, J.; Reid, A.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.23291894\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence-based large language models, like ChatGPT, have been rapidly assessed for both risks and potential in health-related assessment and learning. However, their application in public health professional exams have not yet been studied. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in part of the Faculty of Public Healths Diplomat exam (DFPH). MethodsChatGPT was provided with a bank of 119 publicly available DFPH question parts from past papers. Its performance was assessed by two active DFPH examiners. The degree of insight and level of understanding apparently displayed by ChatGPT was also assessed. ResultsChatGPT passed 3 of 4 papers, surpassing the current pass rate. It performed best on questions relating to research methods. Its answers had a high floor. Examiners identified ChatGPT answers with 73.6% accuracy and human answers with 28.6% accuracy. ChatGPT provided a mean of 3.6 unique insights per question and appeared to demonstrate a required level of learning on 71.4% of occasions. ConclusionsLarge language models have rapidly increasing potential as a learning tool in public health education. However, their factual fallibility and the difficulty of distinguishing their responses from that of humans pose potential threats to teaching and learning.\nA unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk\nAuthors: Jermy, B.; Läll, K.; Wolford, B.

To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.\nA review of scientific theories used to justify the delivery of school-based mindfulness programmes . A protocol for a scoping review\nAuthors: Abbott, P. A.; Nixon, G.; Stanley, I.; D'Ambruoso, L.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291616\nBackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing. MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team. DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.\nSTRESS, ANXIETY AND PTSD PREVALENCE AMONG UKRAINIANS GREW DRAMATICALLY DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF RUSSIAN INVASION: RESULTS OF NATIONWIDE SURVEY\nAuthors: Lushchak, O.; Velykodna, M.; Bolman, S.; Strilbytska, O.; Berezovskyi, V.; Storey, K. B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.23291803\nBackgroundIn February 2022 the Russian federation started a new invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the ongoing war since 2014. After nine years of war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health state of Ukrainians requires systematic monitoring and relevant action. MethodsThis study was designed as an online survey arranged in the 9-12 months after the start of the new invasion of Ukraine and includes sociodemographic data collection, evaluation of stress intensity by PSS-10, anxiety with GAD-7, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder with PCL-5. The sample size of 3173 Ukrainians consisted of 1954 (61.6%) respondents that were not displaced persons (NDPs), 505 (15.9%) internally displaced persons within Ukraine (IDPs), and 714 (22.5%) refugees that left Ukraine. FindingsModerate and high stress was prevalent among 64.7% and 15.5% of NDPs, 64.4% and 21.6% of IDPs, and 68.2% and 25.2% of refugees, respectively. Moderate and severe anxiety was prevalent among 25.6% and 19.0% of NDPs, 25.7% and 23.4% of IDPs, and 26.2% and 25.8% of refugees. High levels of PTSD (33 and higher) were prevalent among 32.8% of NDPs, 39.4% of IDPs, and 47.2% of refugees. DSM-V criteria for PTSD diagnosis was met by 50.8% of NDPs, 55.4% of IDPs, and 62.2% of refugees. InterpretationsThe lowest stress, anxiety, and PTSD severity was observed among NDPs, with significantly higher levels among IDPs and the highest among refugees. Being forcibly displaced from the previous living area and, especially, entering a new cultural environment significantly contributes to the mental health issues caused by war exposure, particularly for people who have directly witnessed the results of war. FundingsMinistry of Education and Science of Ukraine Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreviously published evidence suggested an increase and specificity of stress, anxiety, and PTSD prevalence among Ukrainians by August 2022. Some research provided a data comparison between IDPs and refugees. However, to date, no study has reported a comparison of three groups of Ukrainians: NDPs, IDPs, and refugees abroad. Added value of this studyThis is the first study that provides evidence of the mental health state of Ukrainians after 9-12 months of the Russian invasion in 2022. Furthermore, the research presented was designed as a nationwide survey involving three groups for comparison: NDPs and IDPs within Ukraine, and refugees in other countries. The results of the study show a significant difference between these groups in stress, anxiety, and prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Implications of all available evidenceThe present study contributes to the comprehension of the dynamics in mental health of Ukrainians in response to the war. This data will be helpful both in mental health strategy development by governmental and international policy and in the local clinical work of mental health professionals working with Ukrainians.\nCovid-19 Excess Mortality in China: A Regional Comparison\nAuthors: LIU, L.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291443\nEstimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but higher than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThe emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths worldwide. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities.

ObjectiveWe sought to identify adults who had received a booster vaccination as part of the autumn 2022 campaign in England yet remained at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death and compared to non-COVID-19 risk.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Our total population was 14,644,570 people; there were 6,800 COVID-19 deaths and 150,075 non-COVID-19 deaths.

ExposureSociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnic group, region), disability, body mass index, and diagnosis of a health condition defined from QCovid2.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was COVID-19 death. The secondary outcome was all-cause non-COVID-19 deaths.

ResultsHaving learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntingtons disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinsons disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses.

Conclusions, and RelevanceWe identify groups who are at increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death relative to non-COVID-19 deaths. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death.

FundingNational Core Studies-Immunity, National Core Studies-Data and Connectivity, Health Data Research UK, and the Medical Research Council.

Key PointsQuestion: What health conditions are associated with increased risk of postbooster COVID-19 death in adults who received a COVID-19 vaccination in autumn 2022?

Findings: Certain groups were found to be at overall higher risk of postbooster COVID-19 death (e.g., learning disability or Down Syndrome) and certain groups were found to have significantly higher relative risk of COVID-19 death compared to other non-COVID-19 causes (e.g., cancer of the blood or bone marrow).

Meaning: This work has implications for prioritisation of vaccination booster doses worldwide. We highlight which groups with health conditions are at elevated risk of postbooster COVID-19 death.</p>

ObjectiveTo assess mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA test-negative study using linked health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Participants included symptomatic children aged 6 months to 5 years who were tested by RT-PCR.

ExposuresmRNA-1273 vaccination.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization.

ResultsWe included 3467 test-negative controls and 572 test-positive cases. Receipt of mRNA-1273 was associated with reduced symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (VE=90%; 95%CI: 53, 99%) and COVID-19-related hospitalization (VE=82%; 95%CI: 4, 99%) [&amp;ge;]7 days after the second dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness is initially strong against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Further research is needed to understand long-term effectiveness and the need for booster doses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes.

MethodsWe developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality.

FindingsAfter exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA: -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (&lt;6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14 to 1.77).

InterpretationDeep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSleep plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Nonetheless, much of our understanding of sleep relies on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias. We searched on Web of Science, Medline, and Google Scholar from the database inception to June 23, 2023, using terms that included &#34;wearable&#34;, &#34;actigraphy&#34; or &#34;accelerometer&#34; in combination with &#34;sleep stage&#34; or &#34;sleep classification&#34;, and &#34;polysomnography&#34;. Existing studies have attempted to use machine learning to predict both sleep and sleep stages using accelerometry. However, prior methods were validated in populations of small sample sizes (n&lt;100), making the prediction validity unclear. To date, no study has examined variations of accelerometer-derived sleep stage estimates in large population datasets with longitudinal disease outcomes.

Added value of this studyWe showed that our deep-learning-based method improves sleep staging for wrist-worn accelerometers against the current state-of-the-art. We quantified the model uncertainty in a large multicentre dataset with 1,448 nights of concurrent raw accelerometry and polysomnography recordings. We further demonstrated that our sleep staging method could capture population differences concerning age, season, and other sociodemographic characteristics using a large health database. Shorter overnight sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after seven years of follow-up in groups with both low and high sleep efficiencies.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study helps clinicians to interpret sleep measurements from wearable sensors in routine care. Researchers can use derived sleep parameters in large-scale accelerometer datasets to advance our understanding of the association between sleep and population subgroups with different clinical characteristics. Our findings further suggest that having a short overnight sleep is a risky behaviour regardless of the sleep quality, which requires immediate public attention to fight the social stigma that having a short sleep is acceptable as long as one sleeps well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundArtificial intelligence-based large language models, like ChatGPT, have been rapidly assessed for both risks and potential in health-related assessment and learning. However, their application in public health professional exams have not yet been studied. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in part of the Faculty of Public Healths Diplomat exam (DFPH).

MethodsChatGPT was provided with a bank of 119 publicly available DFPH question parts from past papers. Its performance was assessed by two active DFPH examiners. The degree of insight and level of understanding apparently displayed by ChatGPT was also assessed.

ResultsChatGPT passed 3 of 4 papers, surpassing the current pass rate. It performed best on questions relating to research methods. Its answers had a high floor. Examiners identified ChatGPT answers with 73.6% accuracy and human answers with 28.6% accuracy. ChatGPT provided a mean of 3.6 unique insights per question and appeared to demonstrate a required level of learning on 71.4% of occasions.

ConclusionsLarge language models have rapidly increasing potential as a learning tool in public health education. However, their factual fallibility and the difficulty of distinguishing their responses from that of humans pose potential threats to teaching and learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic Scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex disease across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant for clinical and public health decision making, it is important to account for any varying effects due to common risk factors such as age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate for cumulative incidences over the life course and produce country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases by integrating PGS associations from 7 studies in 4 countries (N=1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGSs had a significant sex-specific effect for 5 diseases (asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes) with all but type 2 diabetes exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS had a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with the effects decreasing linearly with age. We showed for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. For T2D, men and women in the top 1% reached the threshold aged 24.8 (95% CI: 22.5 - 27.6) and 22.3 (95% CI: 20.0 - 25.3) respectively. Individuals in the bottom 1% of PGS did not reach the risk threshold by age 80. Our easily extendable framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting age and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered in schools with the aim of promoting the mental wellbeing of pupils. The apparent success of such interventions has led to calls for mindfulness to be included in the school curriculum. However, the findings are more mixed than is often acknowledged and this may in part be because the theories justifying are rarely considered. Understanding the scientific theories underpinning SBMIs may improve the outcomes from interventions. In this paper we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature to map the scientific theories that have been identified to justify using school-based mindfulness interventions to promote pupils wellbeing.

MethodsThe scoping review methodology will guide the conduct of the review. We will limit our search to scholarly databases and PhD theses to ensure the credibility of the theories. The following databases will be used: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed Central, Scopus and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. We will include any study that includes a theoretical explanation linking a mindfulness intervention with its impact. Information from the papers will be extracted using a framework developed by the team.

DiscussionThe scoping review will map, classify and compare scientific theories that have been used in the literature to justify the use of school-based mindfulness intervention to promote pupils mental wellbeing. The findings will be disseminated through a peer -reviewed journal article, conference presentations, our project website and social media.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn February 2022 the Russian federation started a new invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the ongoing war since 2014. After nine years of war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health state of Ukrainians requires systematic monitoring and relevant action.

MethodsThis study was designed as an online survey arranged in the 9-12 months after the start of the new invasion of Ukraine and includes sociodemographic data collection, evaluation of stress intensity by PSS-10, anxiety with GAD-7, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder with PCL-5. The sample size of 3173 Ukrainians consisted of 1954 (61.6%) respondents that were not displaced persons (NDPs), 505 (15.9%) internally displaced persons within Ukraine (IDPs), and 714 (22.5%) refugees that left Ukraine.

FindingsModerate and high stress was prevalent among 64.7% and 15.5% of NDPs, 64.4% and 21.6% of IDPs, and 68.2% and 25.2% of refugees, respectively. Moderate and severe anxiety was prevalent among 25.6% and 19.0% of NDPs, 25.7% and 23.4% of IDPs, and 26.2% and 25.8% of refugees. High levels of PTSD (33 and higher) were prevalent among 32.8% of NDPs, 39.4% of IDPs, and 47.2% of refugees. DSM-V criteria for PTSD diagnosis was met by 50.8% of NDPs, 55.4% of IDPs, and 62.2% of refugees.

InterpretationsThe lowest stress, anxiety, and PTSD severity was observed among NDPs, with significantly higher levels among IDPs and the highest among refugees. Being forcibly displaced from the previous living area and, especially, entering a new cultural environment significantly contributes to the mental health issues caused by war exposure, particularly for people who have directly witnessed the results of war.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreviously published evidence suggested an increase and specificity of stress, anxiety, and PTSD prevalence among Ukrainians by August 2022. Some research provided a data comparison between IDPs and refugees. However, to date, no study has reported a comparison of three groups of Ukrainians: NDPs, IDPs, and refugees abroad.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study that provides evidence of the mental health state of Ukrainians after 9-12 months of the Russian invasion in 2022. Furthermore, the research presented was designed as a nationwide survey involving three groups for comparison: NDPs and IDPs within Ukraine, and refugees in other countries. The results of the study show a significant difference between these groups in stress, anxiety, and prevalence of PTSD symptoms.

Implications of all available evidenceThe present study contributes to the comprehension of the dynamics in mental health of Ukrainians in response to the war. This data will be helpful both in mental health strategy development by governmental and international policy and in the local clinical work of mental health professionals working with Ukrainians.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality are often considered to reflect the true death toll of the pandemic. As such, information on excess mortality is urgently needed to better understand the impact of the pandemic and prepare for future crises. This study estimated Covid-19 excess mortality at the provincial, regional, and national levels in China and investigated its associated regional disparities. The analyses were based on population and death rates data published by the national and provincial bureaus of statistics in China. The results suggest that excess deaths in China were over 1 million during each year of the pandemic, totaling to over 4 million by the end of 2022, at an excess death rate of 15.4%. This rate was likely comparable to that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but higher than the US rate. Striking disparities were discovered among the 31 provinces with excess death rates ranging from negative rates in two eastern provinces to over 30% in three inland provinces. Rates in western China were over twice as high as those in eastern China. Variations with each individual regions were the largest in the central region and the smallest in the Northeast, which was the hardest hit with excess death rate of over 23%. The regional disparities in excess mortality rates seem to reflect pre-existing regional inequalities in socio-economic development in China. Such findings suggest that China has far to go to mitigate regional inequalities, achieve sustainability, and prepare for the next major crises.</p>
