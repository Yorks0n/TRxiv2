A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; H\nScore: 37.5, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nGods Lockdown: the effect of the April 2022 Colorado low blizzard on SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the midwest United States\nAuthors: Strobel, S.; Daly, M.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297908\nBackgroundLockdowns have been used as a primary non-pharmaceutical intervention to stop transmission of COVID19. There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission. MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties. ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19. ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.\nTrade unions and mental health during an employment crisis. Evidence from the UK before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAuthors: Kromydas, T.; Demou, E.; Leyland, A. H.; Katikireddi, S. V.; Wels, J.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297780\nBackgroundTrade union presence within a workplace could potentially affect employees working conditions and in turn health. We assessed the relationship between union (presence and membership) at the individual level and mental health in the context of COVID-19 employment disruptions. MethodsWe analysed panel data from Understanding Society collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (49,915 observations across 5,988 respondents) to assess the relationship between union presence and membership and a validated epidemiological measure of common mental disorders (CMD), the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire with a score of \u003e/4 indicating probable anxiety/depression, referred to as caseness. A mixed-effect log-linear model assessed effect heterogeneity across time and industries, with average marginal effects (AME) indicating effect differences between groups. FindingsIn our sample, 49.1% worked in a unionised workplace, among which 53.8% were union members. Caseness prevalence was higher during the pandemic (25.4%) compared to pre-pandemic (18.4%). Working in a workplace with a trade union was associated with modest protection against CMD risk; (AMEpre-pandemic:0.010, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.027), (AME- pandemic:-0.002, 95%CI:-0.019; 0.016)]. Similarly, for union membership [(AMEpre- pandemic:0.016, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.039), (AMEpandemic:-0.010, 95%CI:-0.023; 0.020)]. Industry level heterogeneity exists in the relationship between union presence and membership and mental health. InterpretationTrade union presence may have a protective effect on workers mental health in periods of crisis, such as during a pandemic. Within unionised workplaces, trade union membership further mitigated the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. Collective negotiation within workplaces may be protective in periods of uncertainty, benefiting all workers and not only those unionised.

S.; Hong, V.; Holmquist, K. J.; Qian, L.; Farrington, P.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Klein, N. P.; Fireman, B.; Han, B.; Lewin, B. J.\nScore: 154.2, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDisability Documentation in the National Health Interview Survey and Its Consequence: Comparing the American Community Survey to the Washington Group Disability Measures\nAuthors: Landes, S.; Swenor, B. K.; Vaitsiakhovich, N.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297081\nBackground and Objective.The objective of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is to provide data that can be used to monitor the health of the US population. In this study, we evaluate whether the disability questions currently used in the NHIS - the Washington Group questions - threaten the ability of this survey to fulfil its stated objective for disabled people. Methods.Data were from the 2011-2012 NHIS with linkage to mortality status through 2019. We examined the percentage and characteristics of people reporting a disability in the American Community Survey (ACS) disability questions who were documented as such in the Washington Group (WG) disability questions. We then examined the consequence of use of the WG, as opposed to the ACS questions, on estimates of disability prevalence and comparative mortality risk. Results.We find that when compared to their predecessor, the American Community Survey disability questions, the Washington Group questions account for less than half of disabled people, primarily documenting disabled people with a more than one disability status, but excluding many disabled people with only one disability status. As a result of these exclusions, disability prevalence rates based on the Washington Group questions underestimate the size of the disabled population in the US, and overestimate the comparatively higher mortality risk associated with disability status. Conclusions.These results underscore the need to re-evaluate the disability questions used in the NHIS, and invest in the development of improved and expanded disability questionnaires for use in national surveys.\nBarriers and Facilitators for the Use of Telehealth by Healthcare Providers (HCP) in India - A Scoping Review\nAuthors: Sharma, P.; Rao, S.; Krishna Kumar, P.; R Nair, A.; Agrawal, D.; Zadey, S.; Surendran, G.; George Joseph, R.; Dayma, G.; Rafeekh, L.; Saha, S.; Sharma, S.; Prakash, S.; Sankarapandian, V.; John, P.; Patel, V.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297653\nBackgroundIt is widely assumed that telehealth tools like mHealth, telemedicine, and tele-education can supplement the efficiency of Healthcare Providers (HCPs). We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the barriers and facilitators associated with the use of telehealth by HCPs in India. MethodsA systematic literature search following a pre-registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ3U9 [PROTOCOL DOI]) was conducted in PubMed. The search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria were based on the World Health Organizations action framework on Human Resources for Health (HRH) and Universal Health Coverage in India with a specific focus on telehealth tools. Eligible articles published in English from 1st January 2001 to 17th February 2022 were included. ResultsOne hundred and six studies were included in the review. Of these, 53 studies (50%) involved mHealth interventions, 25 (23.6%) involved telemedicine interventions whereas the remaining 28 (26.4%) involved the use of tele-education interventions by HCPs in India. In each category, most of the studies followed a quantitative study design and were mostly published in the last 5 years. The study sites were more commonly present in states present in south India. The facilitators and barriers related to each type of intervention were analyzed under the following sub-headings-1) Human resource related, 2) Application related 3) Technical, and 4) Others. The interventions were most commonly used for improving the management of mental health, non-communicable diseases, and maternal and child health. ConclusionsUse of telehealth has not been uniformly studied in India. The facilitators and barriers to telehealth use need to be kept in mind while designing the intervention. Future studies should focus on looking at region-specific, intervention-specific, and health cadre-specific barriers and facilitators for the use of telehealth.\nDynamic landscape of mpox importation risks driven by heavy-tailed sexual contact networks among men who have sex with men in 2022: a mathematical modeling study\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Miura, F.; Murayama, H.; Funk, S.; Wallinga, J.; Lessler, J.; Endo, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296610\nBackgroundThe 2022 global mpox outbreak spread rapidly, primarily among men who have sex with men in Western countries. The number of countries with new mpox importation events quickly rose in the early phase of the outbreak, but the rate of increase subsequently slowed down, having many countries without any reported cases. MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of international dissemination of mpox infections that accounts for heterogeneous sexual contact networks, infection-derived immunity in the network, and global mobility of infectious individuals. We used this model to characterize the mpox importation patterns observed in 2022 and to discuss the potential of further international spread. FindingsOur analysis showed that the proposed model better explained the observed importation patterns than models not assuming heterogeneity in sexual contacts. Estimated importation hazards decreased from August 2022 in most countries, faster than the decline in the global case counts. We assessed each countrys potential to export mpox cases until the end of an epidemic in the absence of interventions and behavior changes, identifying countries capable of contributing to future international spread if they experience sustained local transmission. InterpretationOur study suggested that the accumulation of immunity among high-risk individuals over highly heterogeneous sexual networks may have contributed to the slowdown in the rate of mpox importations. However, our analysis identified the existence of countries still with the potential to contribute to the global spread of mpox, particularly those with sizable susceptible populations and large international travel volume. This highlights the importance of ensuring equitable access to treatments and resources to prevent the global resurgence of mpox. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMathematical models incorporating interconnectivity between countries have been used to assess the risk of international disease introductions. These approaches have assumed homogenously mixing local populations and have been successful in capturing the international importation patterns observed in previous global respiratory infection outbreaks such as influenza and COVID-19. However, it remains uncertain whether these models can be extended to the context of mpox, which has been transmitted predominantly through sexual activities among men who have sex with men. Previous studies have underpinned the significant role of infection-derived immunity in highly heterogeneous sexual networks in slowing down its transmission. Such key characteristics of mpox have not yet been incorporated in existing approaches to assessing the risk of international spread, which may lead to misguided public health decision-making. Added value of this studyWe constructed a mathematical model of international dissemination of mpox infections considering heterogeneous sexual networks and infection-derived immunity, as well as the global mobility of infectious individuals. By applying this model to the observed mpox importation patterns in 2022, we found that incorporating the accumulation of immunity among high-risk individuals better explains the observed slowdown in the rate of mpox importations between countries. Additionally, the model highlighted the presence of countries that still have the potential to contribute to the global spread of mpox, particularly those with large susceptible populations and a high volume of international travel. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study adds to the growing evidence on the role of accumulated immunity among high-risk individuals in the slowdown the mpox transmission in the 2022 outbreak, which we found to be also the key to better understanding the global importation patterns. Without incorporating this effect, existing modeling approaches may overestimate the mpox importation risks, especially from countries where high-risk groups have already acquired immunity early in the outbreak. Furthermore, our visualization of large susceptible populations remaining in less affected countries, including low- and middle-income countries, highlights the importance of assessing the onward risk of case importation and ensuring equitable access to treatment and control measures in these at-risk countries.\nPsychosocial vulnerabilities in newly arrived asylum seekers to the Greek island of Lesvos: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis\nAuthors: Veizis, A.; Kavarnos, G.; Bressaglia, M.; Norredam, M.; Hargreaves, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297929\nBackground: Kara Tepe Registration and Identification Camp on Lesvos Island in Greece is a controlled access facility with people in various stages of the asylum procedure housed in tents, rub halls and containers in poor living conditions for prolonged periods of time. However, data are lacking on psychosocial vulnerabilities and experiences of these populations, particularly the growing number of single women residing in these settings.We aimed to explore psychosocial needs among this incamped population. Methods:We did a retrospective cross-sectional chart review of socio-demographic and psychosocial vulnerabilities of all migrants (\u003e18 years of age) who were detained in Kara Tepe between 1st February 2021 and 31st January 2023. Data were extracted from the Knack Online Database used by INTERSOS HELLAS. Results: 701 individuals were referred to the clinic for psychosocial work-up over a 2 year follow-up period, of which 165 subsequently received psychological support after initial health assessments. The majority (92.0%) of the cohort were women who were single, most from Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo, and Syria, with a range of medical and social vulnerabilities. 19.8% of the population had been subjected to gender-based violence including in their country of origin, during the migration route to Lesvos, or while on the island of Lesvos. The most common GBV incident reported was rape (48.9%) followed by physical assault (23.7%) and non-penetrative sexual assault (21.5%). 7% of the population presented with suicidal, or self-harming, behaviour, of which 26.2% had attempted suicide. Conclusion: This study highlights for the first time the stark range of vulnerabilities experienced by predominantly single women in camp settings in Greece.\nWastewater-based surveillance for tracing the circulation of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses\nAuthors: Monteiro, S.; Pimenta, R.; Nunes, F.; V. Cunha, M.; Santos, R.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297765\nBackgroundArboviral diseases, transmitted by infected arthropods, pose significant economic and societal threats. Their global distribution and prevalence have increased in recent years, driven by factors such as climate change, biodiversity loss and urbanization. These diseases are often underestimated due to uneven surveillance and asymptomatic cases. Current surveillance relies on monitoring vector occurrence and spatial distribution, as well as syndromic monitoring. In this work, we aimed to explore the utility of wastewater-based surveillance as an additional, added-value tool for vector-borne viruses tracking. MethodsA retrospective wastewater-based surveillance survey was conducted at ten wastewater treatment plants covering a large part of Portugal mainland (North, Lisboa and Vale do Tejo and South regions). Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the RNA concentrations of Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses for a period of 12 months (n = 273 raw wastewater samples), ranging May 2022 - April 2023. FindingsDENV was detected in 25% of the samples, with concentrations spanning from 3{middle dot}5 to 6{middle dot}8 log copies/L. CHIKV was detectable in 11% of the samples, with concentrations up to 6{middle dot}3 log copies/L. Notably, the occurrence of DENV and CHIKV was rather similar between the three regions. The Lisboa and Vale do Tejo region exhibited in general the highest median concentration for DENV and CHIKV following normalization with crAssphage (1{middle dot}5 x 10-4 and 1{middle dot}1 x 10-3, respectively). InterpretationWe demonstrate the efficacy of wastewater-based surveillance as a potent tool for gauging the epidemiological landscape of both DENV and CHIKV in mainland Portugal, where autochthonous cases have not been detected yet. Therefore, WBS should be integrated as a supplementary component to standard surveillance strategies. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWastewater serves as a valuable resource for wastewater-based surveillance (WBS). This surveillance method involves analyzing biomarkers of human metabolism, activities and lifestyle in wastewater to gain insights into public health trends. Previously, WBS has been employed to track chemical substances like illicit drugs, including cocaine, as well as oseltamivir during the 2009 influenza pandemic. It has also played a crucial role in the global polio eradication program by contributing to assess poliovirus circulation in populations and evaluating immunization effectiveness. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a significant boost in wastewater-based surveillance. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first extensive application of this approach to comprehensively investigate and identify the presence of vector-borne viruses RNA such as chikungunya and dengue. In December 2022, we conducted a search on PubMed and Google Scholar for publications using the search terms \"wastewater\" and \"dengue virus\" or \"chikungunya virus\" or \"West Nile virus\" or \"Zika virus\", encompassing manuscripts in all languages. Our search yielded only one study that focused on detecting arboviruses in wastewater, specifically Dengue. Surprisingly, the authors were unable to detect viral RNA despite the reported cases of Dengue between 2017 and 2019, when the wastewater samples were collected. This period included a major outbreak in 2019, with more than 7,000 confirmed cases. Remarkably, no other study has shed light on the presence and concentration of Dengue and Chikungunya viral RNA in wastewater. Added value of this studyIn response to the gap identified in the literature review, this study makes a significant contribution by reporting for the first time the presence and concentration of arboviral RNA, specifically focusing on the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. Notably, it has demonstrated the circulation of these viruses, even when only a few travel-associated cases have been reported throughout the years and where no autochthonous have been reported within the community, although the vector (Aedes albopictus) has been identified in several occasions in mainland Portugal. This research underscores the vital role of wastewater-based surveillance in gaining insights into the circulation trends of underreported pathogens within communities at the sewershed level. Implications of the available informationArboviral infections are significantly underreported, especially in non-endemic countries, and they can lead from mild to severe health issues and even mortality. The symptoms are unspecific and resemble those of various other illnesses, such as Influenza and COVID-19. Consequently, many infected individuals may not seek medical assistance, and when they do, their infections might be misdiagnosed. This results in surveillance for arboviral infections being biased toward individuals presenting with unusual symptoms or severe illness, or returning from endemic regions, leading to delayed reporting and limited temporal and spatial accuracy. In contrast, wastewater surveillance provides results within 24 hours of sample collection and offers a representation of the population served by the sewer system. This includes asymptomatic individuals and those with mild symptoms who may not seek medical care. This approach increases the likelihood of detecting viral circulation and thus prompt public health intervention, namely through vector control, limiting the potential transmission to new hosts, breaking the cycle of transmission. Wastewater surveillance data can play a crucial role in informing public health and environmental decision-making. It can reveal the presence of unaccounted-for infections, indicating the need for control and mitigation strategies, both at the population and mosquito vector levels. Although the arboviral activity is assumed residual in Portugal, wastewater monitoring can be used in complement to the efforts that are already done under the National Vector Surveillance Network. Moreover, this data can be used to communicate with the general public, encouraging them to take actions that can help control the mosquito population, such as reducing stagnant water sources where mosquitoes lay their eggs. This is especially important for vulnerable populations, enabling them to make more informed decisions to mitigate the underlying risks effectively.\nDo children with disabilities have the same opportunities to play as children without disabilities? Evidence from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 38 low and middle-income countries\nAuthors: Smythe, T.; Chen, S.; Rotenberg, S.; Unger, M.; Miner, E.; Seghers, F.; Kuper, H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297603\nBackgroundPlay is essential for the cognitive, social, and emotional development of all children. Disparities potentially exist in access to play for children with disabilities, and the extent of this inequity is unknown. MethodsData from 212,194 children aged 2-4 years in 38 Low and Middle-Income Countries were collected in the UNICEF supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017 - 2020). Disability was assessed by the Washington Group-Child Functioning Module. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between disability and play opportunities, controlling for age, sex, and wealth status. Meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates (overall, and disaggregated by sex), with heterogeneity assessed by Cochrans Q test. FindingsChildren with disabilities have approximately 9% fewer play opportunities than those without disabilities (adjusted RR [aRR] =0.88, 95%CI=0.82-0.93), and this varied across countries. Mongolia and Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe had the lowest likelihood of play opportunities for children with disabilities ((aRR=0.26,95%CI=0.09-0.75; aRR=0.46, 95%CI=0.23-0.93, respectively). Moreover, children with disabilities are 17% less likely to be provided with opportunities to play with their mothers (aRR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.73-0.93), which is further reduced for girls with disabilities (aRR=0.74, 95% CI:0.60-0.90) compared to their peers without disabilities. The associations varied by impairment type, and children with communication and learning impairments are less likely to have opportunities for play with aRR of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.79) and 0.78 (95%CI:0.71-0.86), compared to those without disabilities, respectively. InterpretationChildren with disabilities are being left behind in their access to play and this is likely to have negative impacts on their overall development and well-being. FundingHK and TS receive funding from NIHR. The Study was funded by PENDA. SR receives funding from the Rhodes Trust. Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies reporting population-representative estimates of children with disabilities exposure to play in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) published before Feb 7th, 2023. We used the following combination of keywords: \"play\" AND (\"early childhood\" OR \"preschool\" OR \"young children\") AND (disability OR disabilities) AND \"prevalence\". We found no multi-country studies reporting the prevalence or country-level disparities (within or between countries) for opportunities for play for children with disabilities. We did not identify any studies synthesising or comparing estimates across all dimensions of play or disability, nor did we identify studies reporting population-representative estimates of play for all LMICs. UNICEF has published global reports, which reveal that children with disabilities receive less early stimulation and responsive care and have limited exposure to childrens books and toys compared to children without disabilities, however opportunities for play within the household setting have not been examined in a comprehensive analysis. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the opportunities for play for children with disabilities compared to those without across multiple countries. Moreover, it provides a large dataset on this topic including 212,194 children aged 2-4 years from 38 low and middle income countries (LMICs), including approximately 6.1% with disabilities (i.e. reporting a lot of difficulty or more in a functional domain). The study has advanced the literature in five substantive ways. First, we highlighted that children with disabilities have fewer opportunities to play, across multiple measures of play and multiple settings. Second, we demonstrated that there are disparities in play opportunities for children with disabilities across countries. Third, we showed that this varied by impairment and was worst for children with learning and communication impairments. Fourth, we showed that there was a discrepancy between girls and boys with disabilities. Finally, our work extends beyond simple description by deploying ratio ratios to provide a quantitative risk assessment. This enables us to identify areas of particular concern and suggest where interventions may be most needed. The ratio ratios shed light on the severity of disparities and pinpoint specific high-risk categories such as particular countries, types of disabilities, or population groups. This analysis is crucial for refining interventions and optimising resource allocation, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Implications of all the available evidenceThe study findings emphasise the importance of including children with disabilities in early child development programmes, and where relevant preschool, which may require modifications to ensure inclusivity. Programmes are needed that specifically target children with learning or communication impairments. This may work best through parent support programmes, as formal preschool or programmes may be lacking in LMICs. Monitoring participation is crucial for children with disabilities. To promote equal opportunities for play at home, in schools, and in other community settings, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and attitudes of parents, teachers, and caregivers, as well as implement policies that address barriers to participation. The findings underscore the urgent need for policies to reflect the inclusion of children with disabilities. Research is needed to establish evidence regarding the importance of promoting play opportunities beyond the home environment, including pre-schools, schools, and community settings. Furthermore, well-designed studies to provide affordable, timely and accessible data on effective strategies for enhancing play for children with disabilities are required. This information will enable programme developers and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on improving the lives of children with disabilities worldwide.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLockdowns have been used as a primary non-pharmaceutical intervention to stop transmission of COVID19. There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission.

MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties.

ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19.

ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTrade union presence within a workplace could potentially affect employees working conditions and in turn health. We assessed the relationship between union (presence and membership) at the individual level and mental health in the context of COVID-19 employment disruptions.

MethodsWe analysed panel data from Understanding Society collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (49,915 observations across 5,988 respondents) to assess the relationship between union presence and membership and a validated epidemiological measure of common mental disorders (CMD), the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire with a score of &gt;/4 indicating probable anxiety/depression, referred to as caseness. A mixed-effect log-linear model assessed effect heterogeneity across time and industries, with average marginal effects (AME) indicating effect differences between groups.

FindingsIn our sample, 49.1% worked in a unionised workplace, among which 53.8% were union members. Caseness prevalence was higher during the pandemic (25.4%) compared to pre-pandemic (18.4%). Working in a workplace with a trade union was associated with modest protection against CMD risk; (AMEpre-pandemic:0.010, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.027), (AME- pandemic:-0.002, 95%CI:-0.019; 0.016)]. Similarly, for union membership [(AMEpre- pandemic:0.016, 95%CI:-0.007; 0.039), (AMEpandemic:-0.010, 95%CI:-0.023; 0.020)]. Industry level heterogeneity exists in the relationship between union presence and membership and mental health.

InterpretationTrade union presence may have a protective effect on workers mental health in periods of crisis, such as during a pandemic. Within unionised workplaces, trade union membership further mitigated the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. Collective negotiation within workplaces may be protective in periods of uncertainty, benefiting all workers and not only those unionised.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Objective.The objective of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is to provide data that can be used to monitor the health of the US population. In this study, we evaluate whether the disability questions currently used in the NHIS - the Washington Group questions - threaten the ability of this survey to fulfil its stated objective for disabled people.

Methods.Data were from the 2011-2012 NHIS with linkage to mortality status through 2019. We examined the percentage and characteristics of people reporting a disability in the American Community Survey (ACS) disability questions who were documented as such in the Washington Group (WG) disability questions. We then examined the consequence of use of the WG, as opposed to the ACS questions, on estimates of disability prevalence and comparative mortality risk.

Results.We find that when compared to their predecessor, the American Community Survey disability questions, the Washington Group questions account for less than half of disabled people, primarily documenting disabled people with a more than one disability status, but excluding many disabled people with only one disability status. As a result of these exclusions, disability prevalence rates based on the Washington Group questions underestimate the size of the disabled population in the US, and overestimate the comparatively higher mortality risk associated with disability status.

Conclusions.These results underscore the need to re-evaluate the disability questions used in the NHIS, and invest in the development of improved and expanded disability questionnaires for use in national surveys.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIt is widely assumed that telehealth tools like mHealth, telemedicine, and tele-education can supplement the efficiency of Healthcare Providers (HCPs). We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the barriers and facilitators associated with the use of telehealth by HCPs in India.

MethodsA systematic literature search following a pre-registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KQ3U9 [PROTOCOL DOI]) was conducted in PubMed. The search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion criteria were based on the World Health Organizations action framework on Human Resources for Health (HRH) and Universal Health Coverage in India with a specific focus on telehealth tools. Eligible articles published in English from 1st January 2001 to 17th February 2022 were included.

ResultsOne hundred and six studies were included in the review. Of these, 53 studies (50%) involved mHealth interventions, 25 (23.6%) involved telemedicine interventions whereas the remaining 28 (26.4%) involved the use of tele-education interventions by HCPs in India. In each category, most of the studies followed a quantitative study design and were mostly published in the last 5 years. The study sites were more commonly present in states present in south India. The facilitators and barriers related to each type of intervention were analyzed under the following sub-headings-1) Human resource related, 2) Application related 3) Technical, and 4) Others. The interventions were most commonly used for improving the management of mental health, non-communicable diseases, and maternal and child health.

ConclusionsUse of telehealth has not been uniformly studied in India. The facilitators and barriers to telehealth use need to be kept in mind while designing the intervention. Future studies should focus on looking at region-specific, intervention-specific, and health cadre-specific barriers and facilitators for the use of telehealth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe 2022 global mpox outbreak spread rapidly, primarily among men who have sex with men in Western countries. The number of countries with new mpox importation events quickly rose in the early phase of the outbreak, but the rate of increase subsequently slowed down, having many countries without any reported cases.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of international dissemination of mpox infections that accounts for heterogeneous sexual contact networks, infection-derived immunity in the network, and global mobility of infectious individuals. We used this model to characterize the mpox importation patterns observed in 2022 and to discuss the potential of further international spread.

FindingsOur analysis showed that the proposed model better explained the observed importation patterns than models not assuming heterogeneity in sexual contacts. Estimated importation hazards decreased from August 2022 in most countries, faster than the decline in the global case counts. We assessed each countrys potential to export mpox cases until the end of an epidemic in the absence of interventions and behavior changes, identifying countries capable of contributing to future international spread if they experience sustained local transmission.

InterpretationOur study suggested that the accumulation of immunity among high-risk individuals over highly heterogeneous sexual networks may have contributed to the slowdown in the rate of mpox importations. However, our analysis identified the existence of countries still with the potential to contribute to the global spread of mpox, particularly those with sizable susceptible populations and large international travel volume. This highlights the importance of ensuring equitable access to treatments and resources to prevent the global resurgence of mpox.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMathematical models incorporating interconnectivity between countries have been used to assess the risk of international disease introductions. These approaches have assumed homogenously mixing local populations and have been successful in capturing the international importation patterns observed in previous global respiratory infection outbreaks such as influenza and COVID-19. However, it remains uncertain whether these models can be extended to the context of mpox, which has been transmitted predominantly through sexual activities among men who have sex with men. Previous studies have underpinned the significant role of infection-derived immunity in highly heterogeneous sexual networks in slowing down its transmission. Such key characteristics of mpox have not yet been incorporated in existing approaches to assessing the risk of international spread, which may lead to misguided public health decision-making.

Added value of this studyWe constructed a mathematical model of international dissemination of mpox infections considering heterogeneous sexual networks and infection-derived immunity, as well as the global mobility of infectious individuals. By applying this model to the observed mpox importation patterns in 2022, we found that incorporating the accumulation of immunity among high-risk individuals better explains the observed slowdown in the rate of mpox importations between countries. Additionally, the model highlighted the presence of countries that still have the potential to contribute to the global spread of mpox, particularly those with large susceptible populations and a high volume of international travel.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study adds to the growing evidence on the role of accumulated immunity among high-risk individuals in the slowdown the mpox transmission in the 2022 outbreak, which we found to be also the key to better understanding the global importation patterns. Without incorporating this effect, existing modeling approaches may overestimate the mpox importation risks, especially from countries where high-risk groups have already acquired immunity early in the outbreak. Furthermore, our visualization of large susceptible populations remaining in less affected countries, including low- and middle-income countries, highlights the importance of assessing the onward risk of case importation and ensuring equitable access to treatment and control measures in these at-risk countries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Kara Tepe Registration and Identification Camp on Lesvos Island in Greece is a controlled access facility with people in various stages of the asylum procedure housed in tents, rub halls and containers in poor living conditions for prolonged periods of time. However, data are lacking on psychosocial vulnerabilities and experiences of these populations, particularly the growing number of single women residing in these settings.We aimed to explore psychosocial needs among this incamped population. Methods:We did a retrospective cross-sectional chart review of socio-demographic and psychosocial vulnerabilities of all migrants (&gt;18 years of age) who were detained in Kara Tepe between 1st February 2021 and 31st January 2023. Data were extracted from the Knack Online Database used by INTERSOS HELLAS. Results: 701 individuals were referred to the clinic for psychosocial work-up over a 2 year follow-up period, of which 165 subsequently received psychological support after initial health assessments. The majority (92.0%) of the cohort were women who were single, most from Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo, and Syria, with a range of medical and social vulnerabilities. 19.8% of the population had been subjected to gender-based violence including in their country of origin, during the migration route to Lesvos, or while on the island of Lesvos. The most common GBV incident reported was rape (48.9%) followed by physical assault (23.7%) and non-penetrative sexual assault (21.5%). 7% of the population presented with suicidal, or self-harming, behaviour, of which 26.2% had attempted suicide. Conclusion: This study highlights for the first time the stark range of vulnerabilities experienced by predominantly single women in camp settings in Greece.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundArboviral diseases, transmitted by infected arthropods, pose significant economic and societal threats. Their global distribution and prevalence have increased in recent years, driven by factors such as climate change, biodiversity loss and urbanization. These diseases are often underestimated due to uneven surveillance and asymptomatic cases. Current surveillance relies on monitoring vector occurrence and spatial distribution, as well as syndromic monitoring. In this work, we aimed to explore the utility of wastewater-based surveillance as an additional, added-value tool for vector-borne viruses tracking.

MethodsA retrospective wastewater-based surveillance survey was conducted at ten wastewater treatment plants covering a large part of Portugal mainland (North, Lisboa and Vale do Tejo and South regions). Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the RNA concentrations of Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses for a period of 12 months (n = 273 raw wastewater samples), ranging May 2022 - April 2023.

FindingsDENV was detected in 25% of the samples, with concentrations spanning from 3{middle dot}5 to 6{middle dot}8 log copies/L. CHIKV was detectable in 11% of the samples, with concentrations up to 6{middle dot}3 log copies/L. Notably, the occurrence of DENV and CHIKV was rather similar between the three regions. The Lisboa and Vale do Tejo region exhibited in general the highest median concentration for DENV and CHIKV following normalization with crAssphage (1{middle dot}5 x 10-4 and 1{middle dot}1 x 10-3, respectively).

InterpretationWe demonstrate the efficacy of wastewater-based surveillance as a potent tool for gauging the epidemiological landscape of both DENV and CHIKV in mainland Portugal, where autochthonous cases have not been detected yet. Therefore, WBS should be integrated as a supplementary component to standard surveillance strategies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWastewater serves as a valuable resource for wastewater-based surveillance (WBS). This surveillance method involves analyzing biomarkers of human metabolism, activities and lifestyle in wastewater to gain insights into public health trends. Previously, WBS has been employed to track chemical substances like illicit drugs, including cocaine, as well as oseltamivir during the 2009 influenza pandemic. It has also played a crucial role in the global polio eradication program by contributing to assess poliovirus circulation in populations and evaluating immunization effectiveness.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a significant boost in wastewater-based surveillance. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first extensive application of this approach to comprehensively investigate and identify the presence of vector-borne viruses RNA such as chikungunya and dengue.

In December 2022, we conducted a search on PubMed and Google Scholar for publications using the search terms &#34;wastewater&#34; and &#34;dengue virus&#34; or &#34;chikungunya virus&#34; or &#34;West Nile virus&#34; or &#34;Zika virus&#34;, encompassing manuscripts in all languages. Our search yielded only one study that focused on detecting arboviruses in wastewater, specifically Dengue. Surprisingly, the authors were unable to detect viral RNA despite the reported cases of Dengue between 2017 and 2019, when the wastewater samples were collected. This period included a major outbreak in 2019, with more than 7,000 confirmed cases. Remarkably, no other study has shed light on the presence and concentration of Dengue and Chikungunya viral RNA in wastewater.

Added value of this studyIn response to the gap identified in the literature review, this study makes a significant contribution by reporting for the first time the presence and concentration of arboviral RNA, specifically focusing on the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. Notably, it has demonstrated the circulation of these viruses, even when only a few travel-associated cases have been reported throughout the years and where no autochthonous have been reported within the community, although the vector (Aedes albopictus) has been identified in several occasions in mainland Portugal. This research underscores the vital role of wastewater-based surveillance in gaining insights into the circulation trends of underreported pathogens within communities at the sewershed level.

Implications of the available informationArboviral infections are significantly underreported, especially in non-endemic countries, and they can lead from mild to severe health issues and even mortality. The symptoms are unspecific and resemble those of various other illnesses, such as Influenza and COVID-19. Consequently, many infected individuals may not seek medical assistance, and when they do, their infections might be misdiagnosed. This results in surveillance for arboviral infections being biased toward individuals presenting with unusual symptoms or severe illness, or returning from endemic regions, leading to delayed reporting and limited temporal and spatial accuracy.

In contrast, wastewater surveillance provides results within 24 hours of sample collection and offers a representation of the population served by the sewer system. This includes asymptomatic individuals and those with mild symptoms who may not seek medical care. This approach increases the likelihood of detecting viral circulation and thus prompt public health intervention, namely through vector control, limiting the potential transmission to new hosts, breaking the cycle of transmission.

Wastewater surveillance data can play a crucial role in informing public health and environmental decision-making. It can reveal the presence of unaccounted-for infections, indicating the need for control and mitigation strategies, both at the population and mosquito vector levels. Although the arboviral activity is assumed residual in Portugal, wastewater monitoring can be used in complement to the efforts that are already done under the National Vector Surveillance Network. Moreover, this data can be used to communicate with the general public, encouraging them to take actions that can help control the mosquito population, such as reducing stagnant water sources where mosquitoes lay their eggs. This is especially important for vulnerable populations, enabling them to make more informed decisions to mitigate the underlying risks effectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPlay is essential for the cognitive, social, and emotional development of all children. Disparities potentially exist in access to play for children with disabilities, and the extent of this inequity is unknown.

MethodsData from 212,194 children aged 2-4 years in 38 Low and Middle-Income Countries were collected in the UNICEF supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017 - 2020). Disability was assessed by the Washington Group-Child Functioning Module. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between disability and play opportunities, controlling for age, sex, and wealth status. Meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates (overall, and disaggregated by sex), with heterogeneity assessed by Cochrans Q test.

FindingsChildren with disabilities have approximately 9% fewer play opportunities than those without disabilities (adjusted RR [aRR] =0.88, 95%CI=0.82-0.93), and this varied across countries. Mongolia and Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe had the lowest likelihood of play opportunities for children with disabilities ((aRR=0.26,95%CI=0.09-0.75; aRR=0.46, 95%CI=0.23-0.93, respectively). Moreover, children with disabilities are 17% less likely to be provided with opportunities to play with their mothers (aRR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.73-0.93), which is further reduced for girls with disabilities (aRR=0.74, 95% CI:0.60-0.90) compared to their peers without disabilities. The associations varied by impairment type, and children with communication and learning impairments are less likely to have opportunities for play with aRR of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.79) and 0.78 (95%CI:0.71-0.86), compared to those without disabilities, respectively.

InterpretationChildren with disabilities are being left behind in their access to play and this is likely to have negative impacts on their overall development and well-being.

Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies reporting population-representative estimates of children with disabilities exposure to play in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) published before Feb 7th, 2023. We used the following combination of keywords: &#34;play&#34; AND (&#34;early childhood&#34; OR &#34;preschool&#34; OR &#34;young children&#34;) AND (disability OR disabilities) AND &#34;prevalence&#34;. We found no multi-country studies reporting the prevalence or country-level disparities (within or between countries) for opportunities for play for children with disabilities. We did not identify any studies synthesising or comparing estimates across all dimensions of play or disability, nor did we identify studies reporting population-representative estimates of play for all LMICs. UNICEF has published global reports, which reveal that children with disabilities receive less early stimulation and responsive care and have limited exposure to childrens books and toys compared to children without disabilities, however opportunities for play within the household setting have not been examined in a comprehensive analysis.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the opportunities for play for children with disabilities compared to those without across multiple countries. Moreover, it provides a large dataset on this topic including 212,194 children aged 2-4 years from 38 low and middle income countries (LMICs), including approximately 6.1% with disabilities (i.e. reporting a lot of difficulty or more in a functional domain). The study has advanced the literature in five substantive ways. First, we highlighted that children with disabilities have fewer opportunities to play, across multiple measures of play and multiple settings. Second, we demonstrated that there are disparities in play opportunities for children with disabilities across countries. Third, we showed that this varied by impairment and was worst for children with learning and communication impairments. Fourth, we showed that there was a discrepancy between girls and boys with disabilities. Finally, our work extends beyond simple description by deploying ratio ratios to provide a quantitative risk assessment. This enables us to identify areas of particular concern and suggest where interventions may be most needed. The ratio ratios shed light on the severity of disparities and pinpoint specific high-risk categories such as particular countries, types of disabilities, or population groups. This analysis is crucial for refining interventions and optimising resource allocation, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study findings emphasise the importance of including children with disabilities in early child development programmes, and where relevant preschool, which may require modifications to ensure inclusivity. Programmes are needed that specifically target children with learning or communication impairments. This may work best through parent support programmes, as formal preschool or programmes may be lacking in LMICs. Monitoring participation is crucial for children with disabilities. To promote equal opportunities for play at home, in schools, and in other community settings, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and attitudes of parents, teachers, and caregivers, as well as implement policies that address barriers to participation. The findings underscore the urgent need for policies to reflect the inclusion of children with disabilities. Research is needed to establish evidence regarding the importance of promoting play opportunities beyond the home environment, including pre-schools, schools, and community settings. Furthermore, well-designed studies to provide affordable, timely and accessible data on effective strategies for enhancing play for children with disabilities are required. This information will enable programme developers and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on improving the lives of children with disabilities worldwide.</p>
