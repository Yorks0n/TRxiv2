Vaccines may have non-specific effects on the risk of other infections. The mRNACOVID-19 vaccines were not studied for their effect on overall health before being introduced. Methods: A systematic review investigating overall health effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children younger than 18 years of age were included. Data on severe adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted, with a special focus on non-specific infectious events. In addition to published RCTs, data from the study reports were included. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine recipients with placebo recipients were calculated separately for each vaccine and combined. Results: For SAEs, no significant risk differences between vaccine and placebo were seen. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with a tendency of increased risk of severe AE in the older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.27 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.12-9.57 [0.6% vs 0.2% in vaccinated vs placebo]) in the 12-15(17)-year-olds, 3.93 (0.92-16.88 [0.3% vs 0.1%]) in 5(6)-11-year-olds, but 0.79 (0.43-1.46 [0.6% vs 0.8%]) in the 2-4(5) years and 0.87 (0.46-1.63 [1.2% vs 1.2%]) for the 6-23 months group, resulting in a significant difference between older and younger children (p for homogeneity=0.003). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with a 3-fold higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) (3.03 (1.29-7.09) [0.6% vs 0.2%]). Conclusion: mRNA vaccines were associated with an increased risk of severe AES in the older children, and with an increased risk of LRTI in the younger. The results, in combination with immunological studies, warrant further research into the overall health effects of mRNA vaccines.\nThe remarkable ups and downs of birth rate in Switzerland 2020 to 2023 in a historical context\nAuthors: Le Vu, M.; Matthes, K. L.; Staub, K.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299432\nWe follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births ca. 9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among \u003e30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulating too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the increase before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advancement of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination program. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better understand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.\nInfluenza Mortality as an Indicator of the Efficacy of COVID-Related, Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Reduce the Spread of Respiratory Infections\nAuthors: Morris, R. D.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299157\nBackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to easily and directly evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention. We do, however, have excellent historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and factors influencing that efficacy. ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, influenza mortality was reduced by 91% in the 2020-21 and 69% in the 2021-22 influenza seasons relative to historical levels. The corresponding decreases for the pediatric population were 99% and 67%. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the states 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden. ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these interventions also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs increased in proportion to the size of a states Democratic electorate. This could reflect more effective NPI strategies in states with Democratic leanings or better compliance with NPIs in those states.\nUnderstanding healthcare workers experiences of face mask and RPE use in healthcare settings: an interview study\nAuthors: Carter, H.; Sharp, A.; Davidson, L.; Foster, C.; McGuire, E.; Brown, C. S.; Weston, D.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298509\nWhilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).\nAn electronic cigarette pod system delivering 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog, marketed in the United States as \"PMTA exempt\"\nAuthors: Jordt, S. E.; Jabba, S. V.; Silinski, P.; Berman, M. L.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298778\nAs of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as \"PMTA exempt\", with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing \"Metatine\", a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of \"nicotine\" within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).\n",

        <p class="abstract">We follow population trends in the monthly birth rate in Switzerland almost up to the present and place the latest developments in a historical context. Birth rates in 2022 were the lowest since the 1870s, and the trend is continuing in 2023. The latest decline had already begun 1-2 years before Covid-19. Previous pandemics (1890, 1918, 1920, 1957) had led to a temporary decline in births ca. 9 months after the epidemic peaks. With Covid-19, this appears more complex. During and shortly after the first two waves and shutdowns in 2020, there were more conceptions and thus excess birth rates in 2021, in all available subgroups except Italian-speaking Switzerland, and somewhat more pronounced among &gt;30-year-old mothers and second parities. Possible reasons for the mini-boom include: The increased time at home during the shutdowns has - planned or not - led to more conceptions which has brought pregnancies forward; the corona virus was still circulating too infrequently in this 1st phase of the pandemic to have a negative impact on pregnancies or fertility; at the end of the waves and shutdowns, the perceived end of the pandemic threat could have led to an optimistic mood and thus also more conceptions. The subsequent decline from January 2022 was stronger than the increase before. The first part of the decline in 2022 is most likely due to a negative rebound from the advancement of births in 2020/2021 and deliberately postponed pregnancies due to the start of the vaccination program. The second part of the decline in 2022 is associated with conceptions during the large Omicron wave in the winter of 2021/2022, when many people in Switzerland fell ill. In addition, prices have been rising and real wages falling since 2021, the global political situation has become more unstable, and a general change in values regarding the willingness to have children may also be underway. Following these observations at population level (with limited depth of variables), more in-depth studies must now follow to better understand the dynamic ups and downs in the birth rate in Switzerland in recent years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been criticized as ineffective in preventing COVID. Because it is a new disease with NPIs introduced almost immediately, we have no way to easily and directly evaluate the counterfactual of non-intervention. We do, however, have excellent historic data on influenza, a respiratory disease with similar patterns of transmission and a well-established CDC surveillance system in the US. These data provide us an excellent way to indirectly evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and factors influencing that efficacy.

ResultsDuring the three seasons prior to COVID from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the mean total US influenza mortality was 9,917 deaths per season. During the pandemic, influenza mortality was reduced by 91% in the 2020-21 and 69% in the 2021-22 influenza seasons relative to historical levels. The corresponding decreases for the pediatric population were 99% and 67%. At the state level, the average drop in mortality over the two flu seasons of the pandemic was strongly correlated with the percent of the states 2020 presidential votes cast for Joe Biden.

ConclusionsThese data provide strong evidence that COVID NPIs dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. Given its similar routes of transmission, these results support the assertion that these interventions also substantially reduced COVID transmission, morbidity, and mortality. The effectiveness of NPIs increased in proportion to the size of a states Democratic electorate. This could reflect more effective NPI strategies in states with Democratic leanings or better compliance with NPIs in those states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whilst healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, measures can be put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in healthcare settings. These currently include the use of masks: fluid-resistant surgical masks and respiratory protective equipment. However, for mask policies to be effective, compliance with their use must be high. This study interviewed 12 HCWs from a variety of backgrounds to understand their experiences of mask use. We explored factors associated with compliance with mask use and potential impacts on HCW wellbeing. Overall, participants reported good understanding of the benefits of masks and high compliance levels with policy. However, factors that reduced their compliance with mask policy and impacted their ability to carry out their role were highlighted. These included wearing masks for longer durations, policy being perceived as out of proportion with risk, communication challenges, and discomfort. This study highlights the importance of clear communication of guidance, particularly when it has changed, ensuring staff are familiar with up-to-date research on efficacy of masks, and ensuring guidance aligns with risk. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of masks being required for an appropriate duration (based on risk).</p>

        <p class="abstract">As of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as &#34;PMTA exempt&#34;, with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing &#34;Metatine&#34;, a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of &#34;nicotine&#34; within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).</p>
