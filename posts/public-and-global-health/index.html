  "articleBody": " Impact of Community Masking on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Ontario after Adjustment for Differential Testing by Age and Sex\nAuthors: Peng, A.; Bosco, S.; Tuite, A.; Simmons, A.; Fisman, D.\nScore: 607.9, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293155\nBackground: Use of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test-adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. Methods: We evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. Results: Models that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44-53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. Conclusions: Lack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nClinical manifestations and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tanzania, 2021-2022.\nAuthors: Osati, E. O.; Shayo, G. A.; Nagu, T.; Sangeda, R. Z.; Moshiro, C.; Vumilia, L.; Samwel, L.; Mhame, P.; Nkya, M. E.; Rainer, D.; John, M.; Mbije, C.; Nyaisonga, G.; Kilonzo, K. G.; Nicholaus, M. A.; Seni, J.; Muniko, A.; Wajanga, B.; Ramadhani, A.; Adams, N.; Shekalaghe, S.; Makubi, A.\nScore: 115.1, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292643\nBackgroundThere have been differential mortality rates from Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in different parts of the world. It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania. Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [\u0026ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age \u003e90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P\u003c0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P\u003c0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P\u003c0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study. ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.\nQuantification of Covid-19 Vaccine Coercion in India: A Survey Study\nAuthors: Raman, B.; Banerjee, A.; Vajjala, S. M.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293089\nIntroductionInformed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India. MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings. ResultsA total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non-students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48%-25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67%-26.14%) and non-student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% - 31.43%). ConclusionA significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent. These results are of paramount importance for future policies as well as for posterity.\nGWAS of cataract in Puerto Ricans identifies a novel large-effect variant in ITGA6\nAuthors: Shi, J.; O'Connell, J.; Hicks, B.; Wang, W.; Bryc, K.; Brady, J. J.; Vacic, V.; Freyman, W.; Abul-Husn, N. S.; Auton, A.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Shringarpure, S. S.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293173\nCataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9*10^(-12), OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.\nAssessment of Bacteriological Quality and Associated Risk Factors of Raw Milk Marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda\nAuthors: Emmanuel, N.; Enock, K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293027\nMilk has tremendous nutritional value for both people and animals, but because it also contains water, many different kinds of microbes can develop in it. Dairy products are still sold in both regular and unofficial marketplaces in Rwanda. Significant dangers to human health are associated with milk sold in unregulated markets. The aim of the present study was to assess the bacteriological quality and associated risk factors of raw milk marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda. 126 samples were collected among milk transporters from 14 sectors of Nyagatare district, Rwanda, where 9 samples were taken from each sector and analyzed in veterinary microbiology lab of University of Rwanda, Nyagatare campus. The bacterial analysis was based on carrying out total bacterial count, Coliform count, enumeration of Staphylococcus species and enumeration of Salmonella species. Milk transportes were also asked about risk factors associated with bacterial contamination of raw milk. The total bacterial count, Coliform count and enumerated Staphylococcus species had range from 7.8 x 104 -80 x 104 cfu/mL, 24 x 101 and 80 x 101 cfu/mL and 20.8 x 101 and 211 x 101 cfu/mL respectively and highest prevalence of Salmonella to be 1.58 %. The level of significant was not significant between various bacterial level and several risk factors except for total bacterial count and knowledge about diseases transmitted by raw milk at p \u003c 0.05. It is, therefore, highly recommended that all concerned parties should increase awareness about diseases transmitted by raw milk among milk transporters in Nyagatare district among others.\nNew tuberculosis vaccines in India: Modelling the potential health and economic impacts of adolescent/adult vaccination with M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination\nAuthors: Clark, R. A.; Weerasuriya, C. K.; Portnoy, A.; Mukandavire, C.; Quaife, M.; Bakker, R.; Scarponi, D.; Harris, R. C.; Rade, K.; Mattoo, S. K.; Tumu, D.; Menzies, N. A.; White, R. G.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.24.23286406\nBackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies. MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives. ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease. ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.\nLeft Behind: Modelling the life expectancy disparities amongst people with disabilities in Low and Middle-Income Countries\nAuthors: Rotenberg, S. H.; Smythe, T.; Kuper, H.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292565\nObjectiveTo use life tables to model the differences in life expectancy for people with and without disabilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). MethodsWe used data from a recent conducted a meta-analysis of analysis which gathered data from 70 studies to determine Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality by disability status for children 0-15, adults 15-59, and adults 60+, using the World Health Organisations definition of disability. To assess the disparities in life expectancy among people with disabilities across 136 low and middle-income countries (LMICs), we constructed life tables using these HRs.gap compared to the population average. These calculations were based on the 2020 United Nations population projections. The life expectancy gap was meta-analysed across countries to calculate the mean difference. FindingsPeople with disabilities in LMIC had a mean life expectancy of 49.3 years (95%C.I. 47.4 - 51.2), compared to 68.5 years (95% C.I. 67.4 - 69.5) for the general population, giving a median gap of 19.2 years (95% C.I. 18.3 - 20.1). The disparity in life expectancy varied across countries, ranging from 9.6 years (95% C.I. 4.7 - 17.4) in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 30.6 years (95% C.I. 16.9 - 40.6) in Nigeria. ConclusionLife expectancy inequities represent an urgent threat to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities and achieving global goals. It is crucial to address the disparities in social determinants of health, and prioritise the inclusion of people with disabilities within health equity efforts to close this gap.\nNew frontiers in health literacy: Using ChatGPT to simplify health information for people in the community\nAuthors: Ayre, J.; Mac, O. A.; McCaffery, K. J.; McKay, B. R.; Liu, M.; Shi, Y.; Rezwan, A.; Dunn, A. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23292591\nBackgroundMost health information does not meet the health literacy needs of our communities. Writing health information in plain language is time-consuming but the release of tools like ChatGPT may make it easier to produce reliable plain language health information. ObjectiveTo investigate the capacity for ChatGPT to produce plain language versions of health texts. DesignObservational study. SubjectsTwenty-six health texts from reputable websites. InterventionsChatGPT was prompted to rewrite the text for people with low literacy. Researchers captured three revised versions of each original text. Main MeasuresObjective health literacy assessment, including Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), proportion of the text that contains complex language (%), number of instances of passive voice, and subjective ratings of key messages retained (%). Key ResultsOn average, original texts were written at Grade 12.8 (SD=2.2) and revised to Grade 11.0 (SD=1.2), p\u003c0.001. Original texts were on average 22.8% complex (SD=7.5%) compared to 14.4% (SD=5.6%) in revised texts. Original texts had on average 4.7 instances (SD=3.2) of passive text compared to 1.7 (SD=1.2) in revised texts. On average 80% of key messages were retained. The more complex original texts showed more improvements than less complex original texts. For example, when original texts were [\u0026ge;] Grade 13, revised versions improved by an average 3.3 Grades (SD=2.2), p\u003c0.001. Simpler original texts (\u003c Grade 11) improved by an average 0.5 grades (SD=1.4), p\u003c0.001. ConclusionsThis study used multiple objective assessments of health literacy to demonstrate that ChatGPT can simplify health information while retaining most key messages. However, the revised texts typically did not meet health literacy targets for grade reading level, and improvements were marginal for texts that were already relatively simple.\nKCL TEST: an open-source inspired asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programme in an academic institution\nAuthors: Reis de Andrade, J.; Scourfield, E.; Peswani-Sajnani, S.; Poulton, K.; Ap Rees, T.; Khooshmehri, P.; Doherty, G.; Ong, S.; Ivan, I.; Goudarzi, N.; Gardiner, I.; Caine, E.; Maguire, T.

T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293154\nTesting was paramount in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid deployment of new laboratories became widespread worldwide. Our university established KCL TEST: a SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing programme that enabled sensitive and accessible PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva at 20 to 50% the price of commercial kits. We performed 158,277 PCRs in saliva for staff, students and their household contacts of Kings College London, free of charge and with an average turnaround time of 8 hours. Our pipeline is mainly made of open-source automation and non-commercial reagents and has been recently recommended for ISO15189 accreditation. Here we provide our blueprint and results to enable the rapid launch of diagnostic laboratories where and when needed. Our data span over 18 months and parallels that of the UK Office for National Statistics, with a lower positive rate and virtually no delta wave. Our observations strongly support regular asymptomatic community testing to decrease outbreaks and provide safe working spaces. KCL TEST demonstrates that universities can provide agile, resilient and accurate testing that reflects the infection rate and trend of the general population. We call for the integration of academic institutions in pandemic preparedness, with capabilities to rapidly deploy highly skilled staff, as well as develop, test and accommodate efficient low-cost pipelines.\nFactors influencing COVID-19 vaccination decision-making among African American and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women in Deep South\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Byrd, T.; Qiao, S.; Torres, M. E.; Li, X.; Liu, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292951\nBackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination is vital for ending the pandemic but concerns about its safety among pregnant and postpartum women, especially among African American (AA) and Hispanic women, persist. This study aims to explore factors that influence vaccination decision-making among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women through womens experiences and maternal care providers (MCPs) observations. MethodsFrom January and August 2022, we conducted semi-structured interviews with AA and Hispanic women and MCPs. Participants were recruited from obstetric and pediatric clinics in South Carolina, and all births took place after March 2020. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. ResultsThe study involved 19 AA and 20 Hispanic women, along with 9 MCPs, and revealed both barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. The factors that influence pregnant and postpartum womens decision about COVID-19 vaccine uptake included: 1) awareness of health threats associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 2) vaccine availability and accessibility, 3) vaccine-related knowledge and exposure to misinformation, 4) concerns regarding pre-existing health conditions and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, 5) emotional factors associated with vaccination decision-making processes, 6) concerns about the well-being of infants, 7) cultural perspectives, and 8) encouragement by trusted supporters. ConclusionFindings suggest that reliable information, social support, and trusted doctors advice can motivate COVID-19 vaccination. However, barriers such as misinformation, mistrust in the health care system, and fears related to potential side effects impede vaccination uptake among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women. Future interventions should target these barriers, along with health disparities, involve trusted doctors in outreach, and initiate vaccine conversations to promote vaccination among this population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Use of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test-adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. Methods: We evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. Results: Models that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44-53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. Conclusions: Lack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere have been differential mortality rates from Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in different parts of the world. It is not clear whether the clinical presentation does also differ, thus the need for this study in a Sub-Saharan African country. The aim of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in selected tertiary hospitals in Tanzania.

Methods and FindingsA retrospective analysis of archived data from 26th March, 2021 to 30th September, 2022 was done for adults aged [&amp;ge;]18 years who were admitted in five tertiary-level hospitals in Tanzania. Information collected included socio-demographic, radiological and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as outcome of the admission (discharge vs death). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi square test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and the collected variables. Out of 1387 COVID-19 patients, approximately 52% were males. The median age was 60 years [(IQR)= (19-102)). The most common symptoms were dyspnea (943,68%), cough (889, 64%), fever (597,43%) and fatigue (570, 41%). In hospital mortality was (476, 34%). Mortality significantly increased with increasing age, being the most in age &gt;90 years [aOR (95% CI) =6.72 (1.94-20.81), P&lt;0.001. Other predictors of death were not possessing a health insurance, [aOR (95% CI) = 2.78 (2.09-3.70), P&lt;0. 001], dyspnea [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40(1.02-2.06), P=0.03]; chest pain, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.12-3.21), P=0.03]; HIV positivity, [aOR (95% CI) = 4.62 (2.51-8.73), P&lt;0.001]; neutrophilia, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.02 (1.01 - 1.03), P=0.02]; none use of ivermectin, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.46 (1.09 - 2.22), P=0.02] and non-use of steroid, [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.2 - 2.5), P=0.04]. Retrospective nature of this study which based on documented patients records, with a large number of patients left out of the analysis due to missed data, this might in a way affect the results of the present study.

ConclusionsThe most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever, just as what was common elsewhere in the world. Mortality increased significantly with age, in HIV-infected patients, in those without a health insurance, those presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or neutrophilia and those who did not use steroid or ivermectin. Clinicians should actively look for the predictors of mortality and take appropriate management to reduce mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionInformed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics, enshrined in the constitution of most countries, as well as in international documents. However, mandates for Covid-19 vaccination as well as coercion was prevalent in many places in the world, including in India. Against this background, we did a cross sectional study to assess and quantify the extent of Covid-19 vaccine coercion in India.

MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from IIT Bombay. This survey was conducted using a pretested questionnaire anonymously amongst the college students and adults in Mumbai from October 2022 to December 2022. The questionnaire contained details of why the vaccine was taken, and if the participant was a student. Descriptive analysis was conducted and frequencies, percentages along with 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the findings.

ResultsA total of 483 participants responded, which included both students and non-students, of which 470 participants reported having taken the vaccine. A total of 106 (21.95%, 95% C.I. 18.48%-25.85%) reported to have pressured into taking the vaccine. The level of coercion was similar among college students 78 (21.61%, 95% C.I. 17.67%-26.14%) and non-student adults 28 (22.95%, 95% C.I. 15.82% - 31.43%).

ConclusionA significant proportion was coerced into taking the vaccines, violating the requirement for informed consent. These results are of paramount importance for future policies as well as for posterity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9*10^(-12), OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Milk has tremendous nutritional value for both people and animals, but because it also contains water, many different kinds of microbes can develop in it. Dairy products are still sold in both regular and unofficial marketplaces in Rwanda. Significant dangers to human health are associated with milk sold in unregulated markets. The aim of the present study was to assess the bacteriological quality and associated risk factors of raw milk marketed in Nyagatare district, Rwanda. 126 samples were collected among milk transporters from 14 sectors of Nyagatare district, Rwanda, where 9 samples were taken from each sector and analyzed in veterinary microbiology lab of University of Rwanda, Nyagatare campus. The bacterial analysis was based on carrying out total bacterial count, Coliform count, enumeration of Staphylococcus species and enumeration of Salmonella species. Milk transportes were also asked about risk factors associated with bacterial contamination of raw milk. The total bacterial count, Coliform count and enumerated Staphylococcus species had range from 7.8 x 104 -80 x 104 cfu/mL, 24 x 101 and 80 x 101 cfu/mL and 20.8 x 101 and 211 x 101 cfu/mL respectively and highest prevalence of Salmonella to be 1.58 %. The level of significant was not significant between various bacterial level and several risk factors except for total bacterial count and knowledge about diseases transmitted by raw milk at p &lt; 0.05. It is, therefore, highly recommended that all concerned parties should increase awareness about diseases transmitted by raw milk among milk transporters in Nyagatare district among others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIndia had an estimated 2.9 million tuberculosis cases and 506 thousand deaths in 2021. Novel vaccines effective in adolescents and adults could reduce this burden. M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination have recently completed Phase IIb trials and estimates of their population-level impact are needed. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination in India and investigated the impact of variation in vaccine characteristics and delivery strategies.

MethodsWe developed an age-stratified compartmental tuberculosis transmission model for India calibrated to country-specific epidemiology. We projected baseline epidemiology to 2050 assuming no-new-vaccine introduction, and M72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination scenarios over 2025-2050 exploring uncertainty in product characteristics (vaccine efficacy, mechanism of effect, infection status required for vaccine efficacy, duration of protection) and implementation (achieved vaccine coverage and ages targeted). We estimated reductions in tuberculosis cases and deaths by each scenario compared to no-new-vaccine introduction, as well as costs and cost-effectiveness from health-system and societal perspectives.

ResultsM72/AS01E scenarios were predicted to avert 40% more tuberculosis cases and deaths by 2050 compared to BCG-revaccination scenarios. Cost-effectiveness ratios for M72/AS01E vaccines were around seven times higher than BCG-revaccination, but nearly all scenarios were cost-effective. The estimated average incremental cost was US$190 million for M72/AS01E and US$23 million for BCG-revaccination per year. Sources of uncertainty included whether M72/AS01E was efficacious in uninfected individuals at vaccination, and if BCG-revaccination could prevent disease.

ConclusionsM72/AS01E and BCG-revaccination could be impactful and cost-effective in India. However, there is great uncertainty in impact, especially given unknowns surrounding mechanism of effect and infection status required for vaccine efficacy. Greater investment in vaccine development and delivery is needed to resolve these unknowns in vaccine product characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo use life tables to model the differences in life expectancy for people with and without disabilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

MethodsWe used data from a recent conducted a meta-analysis of analysis which gathered data from 70 studies to determine Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality by disability status for children 0-15, adults 15-59, and adults 60&#43;, using the World Health Organisations definition of disability. To assess the disparities in life expectancy among people with disabilities across 136 low and middle-income countries (LMICs), we constructed life tables using these HRs.gap compared to the population average. These calculations were based on the 2020 United Nations population projections. The life expectancy gap was meta-analysed across countries to calculate the mean difference.

FindingsPeople with disabilities in LMIC had a mean life expectancy of 49.3 years (95%C.I. 47.4 - 51.2), compared to 68.5 years (95% C.I. 67.4 - 69.5) for the general population, giving a median gap of 19.2 years (95% C.I. 18.3 - 20.1). The disparity in life expectancy varied across countries, ranging from 9.6 years (95% C.I. 4.7 - 17.4) in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 30.6 years (95% C.I. 16.9 - 40.6) in Nigeria.

ConclusionLife expectancy inequities represent an urgent threat to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities and achieving global goals. It is crucial to address the disparities in social determinants of health, and prioritise the inclusion of people with disabilities within health equity efforts to close this gap.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMost health information does not meet the health literacy needs of our communities. Writing health information in plain language is time-consuming but the release of tools like ChatGPT may make it easier to produce reliable plain language health information.

ObjectiveTo investigate the capacity for ChatGPT to produce plain language versions of health texts.

DesignObservational study.

SubjectsTwenty-six health texts from reputable websites.

InterventionsChatGPT was prompted to  rewrite the text for people with low literacy. Researchers captured three revised versions of each original text.

Main MeasuresObjective health literacy assessment, including Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), proportion of the text that contains complex language (%), number of instances of passive voice, and subjective ratings of key messages retained (%).

Key ResultsOn average, original texts were written at Grade 12.8 (SD=2.2) and revised to Grade 11.0 (SD=1.2), p&lt;0.001. Original texts were on average 22.8% complex (SD=7.5%) compared to 14.4% (SD=5.6%) in revised texts. Original texts had on average 4.7 instances (SD=3.2) of passive text compared to 1.7 (SD=1.2) in revised texts. On average 80% of key messages were retained. The more complex original texts showed more improvements than less complex original texts. For example, when original texts were [&amp;ge;] Grade 13, revised versions improved by an average 3.3 Grades (SD=2.2), p&lt;0.001. Simpler original texts (&lt; Grade 11) improved by an average 0.5 grades (SD=1.4), p&lt;0.001.

ConclusionsThis study used multiple objective assessments of health literacy to demonstrate that ChatGPT can simplify health information while retaining most key messages. However, the revised texts typically did not meet health literacy targets for grade reading level, and improvements were marginal for texts that were already relatively simple.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Testing was paramount in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid deployment of new laboratories became widespread worldwide. Our university established KCL TEST: a SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing programme that enabled sensitive and accessible PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva at 20 to 50% the price of commercial kits. We performed 158,277 PCRs in saliva for staff, students and their household contacts of Kings College London, free of charge and with an average turnaround time of 8 hours. Our pipeline is mainly made of open-source automation and non-commercial reagents and has been recently recommended for ISO15189 accreditation. Here we provide our blueprint and results to enable the rapid launch of diagnostic laboratories where and when needed. Our data span over 18 months and parallels that of the UK Office for National Statistics, with a lower positive rate and virtually no delta wave. Our observations strongly support regular asymptomatic community testing to decrease outbreaks and provide safe working spaces. KCL TEST demonstrates that universities can provide agile, resilient and accurate testing that reflects the infection rate and trend of the general population. We call for the integration of academic institutions in pandemic preparedness, with capabilities to rapidly deploy highly skilled staff, as well as develop, test and accommodate efficient low-cost pipelines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination is vital for ending the pandemic but concerns about its safety among pregnant and postpartum women, especially among African American (AA) and Hispanic women, persist. This study aims to explore factors that influence vaccination decision-making among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women through womens experiences and maternal care providers (MCPs) observations.

MethodsFrom January and August 2022, we conducted semi-structured interviews with AA and Hispanic women and MCPs. Participants were recruited from obstetric and pediatric clinics in South Carolina, and all births took place after March 2020. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis.

ResultsThe study involved 19 AA and 20 Hispanic women, along with 9 MCPs, and revealed both barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. The factors that influence pregnant and postpartum womens decision about COVID-19 vaccine uptake included: 1) awareness of health threats associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 2) vaccine availability and accessibility, 3) vaccine-related knowledge and exposure to misinformation, 4) concerns regarding pre-existing health conditions and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, 5) emotional factors associated with vaccination decision-making processes, 6) concerns about the well-being of infants, 7) cultural perspectives, and 8) encouragement by trusted supporters.

ConclusionFindings suggest that reliable information, social support, and trusted doctors advice can motivate COVID-19 vaccination. However, barriers such as misinformation, mistrust in the health care system, and fears related to potential side effects impede vaccination uptake among AA and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women. Future interventions should target these barriers, along with health disparities, involve trusted doctors in outreach, and initiate vaccine conversations to promote vaccination among this population.</p>
