A.; Shoaibi, A.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301676\nActive monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure. ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\nHeterogeneity in deaths of despair: excess mortality in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Kandula, S.; Keyes, K. M.; Shaman, J.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301291\nThe impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.\nOverall Health Effects of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Hoffmann, S. S.; Nielsen, S.; Thysen, S. M.; Duriseti, R.; Benn, C. S.\nScore: 1351.6, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23298573\nImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (\"SAEs\") and severe adverse events (\"Severe AEs\") as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.\nProcessed food intake assortativity in the personal networks of East European older adults\nAuthors: Hancean, M.-G.; Lerner, J.; Perc, M.; Molina, J. L.; Geanta, M.; Oana, I.; Pintoiu Mihaila, B. E.; Puncioiu, S. E.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301787\nCoalescing evidence shows that food habits circulate through social relationships. However, seniors social networks and unhealthy dietary choices remain underexplored, particularly within rural Eastern Europes unique socioeconomic and cultural contexts. We investigate how social networks affect the consumption of processed foods high in salt among community-dwelling older adults (64 years of age and older) from a Romanian rural community. We use an observational cross-sectional quantitative approach (a personal network research design) to collect self-reported information about the study participants (egos; n = 83), their social contacts (alters), and the relationships among them (ego-alter and alter-alter ties). We fit multi-level, mixed-effects models, clustering alters by their egos, and show that older adults eating processed food high in salt are more likely to be connected to alters with similar eating habits (assortativity). This result is of particular relevance when considering the nutritional health of older adults, as it implies that interventions targeting this demographic should extend beyond the individual to encompass their social environment. Despite the cross-sectional approach limitations, our work may enrich the understanding of dietary patterns among rural Eastern European seniors and provide an empirical foundation for designing targeted interventions that can mitigate health risks associated with high-salt diets in older populations.\nAn ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties\nAuthors: Ali, S.; Azarian, T.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301823\nBackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves. MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors. ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p \u003c 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.\nPooled evidence precision of clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment was stabilized eight months after the outbreak.\nAuthors: Ribeiro, T. B.; Ramirez, P. C.; de Melo, L. R. S.; Diaz-Quijano, F. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301572\nOBJECTIVEAt the beginning of 2020, hydroxychloroquine showed promising in vitro activity for Covid-19 and several studies were oriented to assess its safety and efficacy. However, after a few months, hydroxychloroquine has proved ineffective. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed quickly and in different settings represent the scientific communitys capacity to assess drug repositioning effectiveness during a sanitary crisis. Therefore, a critical evaluation of the evidence generated can guide future efforts in analogous situations. We aimed to analyze the RCTs assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19, describe their internal validity and power, and evaluate their contribution to the precision of the combined evidence for assessing the mortality outcome. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGSThis meta-research included RCTs assessing hydroxychloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with Covid-19. It was part of an umbrella systematic review of methods/meta-research (PROSPERO: CRD42022360331) that included a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Latin America Database - Lilacs. We retrieved studies published until January 10th, 2022. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0. We analyzed methodology of the studies, precision and random error change through time from pooled evidence, study comparators, patient important outcome, power in different magnitude of effects proxy. RESULTSA total of 22 RCT were included, from that 17 (77%) assessed hospitalized patients and five (23%) outpatients setting. Mortality was related as primary endpoint in only 4 studies, however half of the studies included composite endpoints including mortality as a component. The internal validity analysis using RoB2 found that eight studies (36%) had a high risk of bias. Only one study had sufficient power to evaluate a moderate magnitude of effect (RR = 0,7 on mortality). The standard error to evaluate efficacy on mortality did not change appreciably after October 2020. From Oct 2020 to Dec 2021, 18 additional studies were published with 2,429 patients recruited. CONCLUSIONThis meta-research highlights the impact that collaborative, and network scientific research have on informing clinical decision-making. Duplicate efforts create research waste as precision analysis shows that after October 2020, there was not appreciably changes in the precision of the pooled RCT evidence to estimate the hydroxychloroquine effect on mortality. What is new?O_LIAfter Oct2020, grouped RCT on the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 showed that precision estimate has not been appreciably modified in subsequent studies. C_LIO_LIAt least 18 RCT (n=2,429) could potentially be saved through collaborative work. C_LIO_LIMost individual studies did not have sufficient power to assess the size of moderate effect size on mortality. C_LIO_LIStrengthening cooperation and integrating research centers can decrease research waste.

As GMH enters its second decade, there have been numerous critiques of its origins and underlying paradigms, with increasing emphasis on critical approaches in recent publications. However, there is no comprehensive synthesis has yet been undertaken to understand how critical perspectives have been integrated into the GMH literature. To contribute to the ongoing discourse aimed at cultivating GMH as a critical and socially responsive discipline, this article employed the critical interpretive synthesis method. critical interpretive synthesis is designed to navigate the synthesis of extensive and diverse literature while actively engaging with the foundational assumptions that shape and inform the body of research via employing a critical lens to scrutinize the data. We conducted searches using PubMed, MEDLINE(OVID), PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE data bases; published between 2007 and February 2023. We included 58 articles that have embraced critical perspectives, whether explicitly or implicitly. Through this iterative process, five distinct themes or \"four turns\" emerge: (1) the inward turn, focusing on the \"local\" as a source of alterity, resistance, and critique; (2) turning the critical lens outward or political turn; (3) the push for a broader agenda; and (4) the reflexive turn. This article discusses the implications of four \"turns\" in how critical perspectives have been and are being used, in relation to the goal of developing as a socially responsive discipline.\nTriple-drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole for the acceleration of lymphatic filariasis elimination in Kenya: Programmatic implementation and results of the first impact surveillance\nAuthors: Njenga, S. M.; Kanyi, H.; Okoyo, C.; Githinji, E.; Mwatele, C.; Matendechero, H. S.; Omondi, W. P.; Gitahi, P. N.; Owaga, C.; Onsongo, J. K.; Gass, K.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24301765\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of triple-drug mass drug administration (MDA) regimen with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (commonly abbreviated as IDA) to accelerate the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem in settings where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic. The National Programme for Elimination of LF (NPELF) in Kenya was among the first adopters of the IDA-MDA and two annual rounds were provided in 2018 and 2019 to the residents of Lamu County and Jomvu sub-County in the coast region. There is a need to determine efficient sampling strategies, indicators, and the appropriate population groups that could be used for the monitoring and evaluation of LF programs using IDA-MDA for the elimination of the disease as a public health problem. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted at baseline in 2018 before IDA-MDA and an impact assessment 17 months after the second round of IDA-MDA. The reported epidemiological treatment coverage was at least 80% in all implementation units during each round of IDA-MDA. Blood samples were tested for circulating filarial antigens using commercial Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) and any individual that was found to be positive was tested again at night for the presence of microfilariae in finger prick blood smears using microscopy. The overall prevalence of LF infection was relatively low at the baseline survey with Jomvu having 1.39% (95% CI: 0.91, 2.11) and Lamu having 0.48% (95% CI: 0.21, 1.13). Significant reductions in LF prevalence were observed during the impact assessment after two annual rounds of treatment. The overall relative risk reduction (%) in LF prevalence following the two rounds of MDA with IDA was significant in both Jomvu (52.45%, Z = -2.46, P \u003c 0.02) and Lamu (52.71%, Z = -1.97, P \u003c 0.05). Heterogeneity, however, was observed in the LF prevalence reduction between random and purposive clusters, as well as between adult and child populations. The results of the endline impact survey offered strong evidence that it was safe to stop the IDA-MDA in the two EUs because transmission appears to have been interrupted. It is also important to implement a post-treatment surveillance system which would enable efficient detection of any recrudescence of LF infection transmission at a sub-evaluation unit level. Our findings show that IDA-MDA may be considered for acceleration of LF elimination in other settings where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic.\nInformation Bottlenecks in Forecasting COVID-19\nAuthors: Gamarnik, D.; Ma, M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24302003\nReliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate. In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20+ days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the ''memoryless'' property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure.

ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States.

DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline.

Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems.

Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines.

ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children.

ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and severe adverse events (&#34;Severe AEs&#34;) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coalescing evidence shows that food habits circulate through social relationships. However, seniors social networks and unhealthy dietary choices remain underexplored, particularly within rural Eastern Europes unique socioeconomic and cultural contexts. We investigate how social networks affect the consumption of processed foods high in salt among community-dwelling older adults (64 years of age and older) from a Romanian rural community. We use an observational cross-sectional quantitative approach (a personal network research design) to collect self-reported information about the study participants (egos; n = 83), their social contacts (alters), and the relationships among them (ego-alter and alter-alter ties). We fit multi-level, mixed-effects models, clustering alters by their egos, and show that older adults eating processed food high in salt are more likely to be connected to alters with similar eating habits (assortativity). This result is of particular relevance when considering the nutritional health of older adults, as it implies that interventions targeting this demographic should extend beyond the individual to encompass their social environment. Despite the cross-sectional approach limitations, our work may enrich the understanding of dietary patterns among rural Eastern European seniors and provide an empirical foundation for designing targeted interventions that can mitigate health risks associated with high-salt diets in older populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves.

MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors.

ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p &lt; 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEAt the beginning of 2020, hydroxychloroquine showed promising in vitro activity for Covid-19 and several studies were oriented to assess its safety and efficacy. However, after a few months, hydroxychloroquine has proved ineffective. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) developed quickly and in different settings represent the scientific communitys capacity to assess drug repositioning effectiveness during a sanitary crisis. Therefore, a critical evaluation of the evidence generated can guide future efforts in analogous situations. We aimed to analyze the RCTs assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19, describe their internal validity and power, and evaluate their contribution to the precision of the combined evidence for assessing the mortality outcome.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGSThis meta-research included RCTs assessing hydroxychloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with Covid-19. It was part of an umbrella systematic review of methods/meta-research (PROSPERO: CRD42022360331) that included a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Latin America Database - Lilacs. We retrieved studies published until January 10th, 2022. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0. We analyzed methodology of the studies, precision and random error change through time from pooled evidence, study comparators, patient important outcome, power in different magnitude of effects proxy.

RESULTSA total of 22 RCT were included, from that 17 (77%) assessed hospitalized patients and five (23%) outpatients setting. Mortality was related as primary endpoint in only 4 studies, however half of the studies included composite endpoints including mortality as a component. The internal validity analysis using RoB2 found that eight studies (36%) had a high risk of bias. Only one study had sufficient power to evaluate a moderate magnitude of effect (RR = 0,7 on mortality). The standard error to evaluate efficacy on mortality did not change appreciably after October 2020. From Oct 2020 to Dec 2021, 18 additional studies were published with 2,429 patients recruited.

CONCLUSIONThis meta-research highlights the impact that collaborative, and network scientific research have on informing clinical decision-making. Duplicate efforts create research waste as precision analysis shows that after October 2020, there was not appreciably changes in the precision of the pooled RCT evidence to estimate the hydroxychloroquine effect on mortality.

What is new?O_LIAfter Oct2020, grouped RCT on the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 showed that precision estimate has not been appreciably modified in subsequent studies.
C_LIO_LIAt least 18 RCT (n=2,429) could potentially be saved through collaborative work.
C_LIO_LIMost individual studies did not have sufficient power to assess the size of moderate effect size on mortality.
C_LIO_LIStrengthening cooperation and integrating research centers can decrease research waste.

As GMH enters its second decade, there have been numerous critiques of its origins and underlying paradigms, with increasing emphasis on critical approaches in recent publications. However, there is no comprehensive synthesis has yet been undertaken to understand how critical perspectives have been integrated into the GMH literature. To contribute to the ongoing discourse aimed at cultivating GMH as a critical and socially responsive discipline, this article employed the critical interpretive synthesis method. critical interpretive synthesis is designed to navigate the synthesis of extensive and diverse literature while actively engaging with the foundational assumptions that shape and inform the body of research via employing a critical lens to scrutinize the data. We conducted searches using PubMed, MEDLINE(OVID), PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE data bases; published between 2007 and February 2023. We included 58 articles that have embraced critical perspectives, whether explicitly or implicitly. Through this iterative process, five distinct themes or &#34;four turns&#34; emerge: (1) the inward turn, focusing on the &#34;local&#34; as a source of alterity, resistance, and critique; (2) turning the critical lens outward or political turn; (3) the push for a broader agenda; and (4) the reflexive turn. This article discusses the implications of four &#34;turns&#34; in how critical perspectives have been and are being used, in relation to the goal of developing as a socially responsive discipline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of triple-drug mass drug administration (MDA) regimen with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (commonly abbreviated as IDA) to accelerate the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem in settings where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic. The National Programme for Elimination of LF (NPELF) in Kenya was among the first adopters of the IDA-MDA and two annual rounds were provided in 2018 and 2019 to the residents of Lamu County and Jomvu sub-County in the coast region. There is a need to determine efficient sampling strategies, indicators, and the appropriate population groups that could be used for the monitoring and evaluation of LF programs using IDA-MDA for the elimination of the disease as a public health problem. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted at baseline in 2018 before IDA-MDA and an impact assessment 17 months after the second round of IDA-MDA. The reported epidemiological treatment coverage was at least 80% in all implementation units during each round of IDA-MDA. Blood samples were tested for circulating filarial antigens using commercial Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) and any individual that was found to be positive was tested again at night for the presence of microfilariae in finger prick blood smears using microscopy. The overall prevalence of LF infection was relatively low at the baseline survey with Jomvu having 1.39% (95% CI: 0.91, 2.11) and Lamu having 0.48% (95% CI: 0.21, 1.13). Significant reductions in LF prevalence were observed during the impact assessment after two annual rounds of treatment. The overall relative risk reduction (%) in LF prevalence following the two rounds of MDA with IDA was significant in both Jomvu (52.45%, Z = -2.46, P &lt; 0.02) and Lamu (52.71%, Z = -1.97, P &lt; 0.05). Heterogeneity, however, was observed in the LF prevalence reduction between random and purposive clusters, as well as between adult and child populations. The results of the endline impact survey offered strong evidence that it was safe to stop the IDA-MDA in the two EUs because transmission appears to have been interrupted. It is also important to implement a post-treatment surveillance system which would enable efficient detection of any recrudescence of LF infection transmission at a sub-evaluation unit level. Our findings show that IDA-MDA may be considered for acceleration of LF elimination in other settings where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate. In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20&#43; days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the &#39;&#39;memoryless&#39;&#39; property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.</p>
