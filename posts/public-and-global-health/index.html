This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (\u003e18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 +54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57+48.33), shortness of breath (131.89+60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59+58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.\nGenomic epidemiology of the cholera outbreak in Malawi 2022-2023\nAuthors: Chabuka, L.; Choga, W. T.; Mavian, C. N.; Moir, M.; Tegally, H.; Wilkinson, E.; Naidoo, Y.; Inward, R.; Morgenstern, C.; Bhatt, S.; Wint, W. G. R.; Khan, K.; Bogoch, I. I.; Kraemer, M. U.

B.; Chiwaula, M.; Chavula, Y.; Bukhu, M.; Manda, H.; Chitenje, M.; Malolo, I.; Mwanyongo, A.; Mvula, B.; Nyenje, M.; de Oliveira, T.; Kagoli, M.\nScore: 32.9, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294324\nSince early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.\nKCL TEST: an open-source inspired asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programme in an academic institution\nAuthors: Reis de Andrade, J.; Scourfield, E.; Peswani-Sajnani, S.; Poulton, K.; Ap Rees, T.; Khooshmehri, P.; Doherty, G.; Ong, S.; Ivan, I.; Goudarzi, N.; Gardiner, I.; Caine, E.; Maguire, T.

T.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293154\nObjectivesTo establish a SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing programme in an academic institution to analyze saliva samples collected from asymptomatic staff and students. DesignPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva self-collected by asymptomatic students and staff members from Kings College London, and their household contacts. Standards for diagnostics testing set by the DHSC (UK) were followed to develop an automated saliva PCR service for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Prospective study that run from December 2020 until July 2022. SettingTesting took place in an academic institution including 18 different locations in London (UK). ParticipantsThere were no selection criteria; asymptomatic participants were encouraged to test regularly (twice weekly when on campus). Main outcome measuresNumber of tests, number of participants and positive rate. Results158,277 PCR tests were carried out on saliva, of which 2,989 were positive (1.89%), collected by 20,186 participants. Between 10-30% of campus footfall were tested. The positive rate was equivalent to that reported by the Office for National Statistics (UK), except for the period encompassing the delta variant; this wave was nearly absent in our cohort. We employed non-commercial reagents and an open source-inspired automated pipeline for sample processing. This rapidly developed service was awarded UKAS accreditation under the ISO15189 standard. ConclusionsIncluding academic institutions in pandemic preparedness is a critical consideration, considering the experience in developing, validating, and implementing economic and scalable testing solutions. Given the joint ventures in hospital pathology departments across the UK and the move to centralised, automated, commercial tests, focusing on academic centres that can carry out research and development to test for novel and re-emerging pathogens should be a top priority.\nA Scoping Review of Pacing for Management of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): Lessons Learned for the Long COVID Pandemic\nAuthors: Sanal-Hayes, N.; Mclaughlin, M.; Hayes, L. D. D.; Mair, J.; Ormerod, J.; Carless, D.; Hilliard, N.; Meach, R.; Ingram, J.; Sculthorpe, N.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293935\nBackgroundControversy over treatment for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a barrier to appropriate treatment. Energy management or pacing is a prominent coping strategy for people with ME/CFS that involves regulating activity to avoid post exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after an activity. Until now, characteristics of pacing, and the effects on patients symptoms had not been systematically reviewed. This is problematic as the most common approach to pacing, pacing prescription, and the pooled efficacy of pacing was unknown. Collating evidence may help advise those suffering with similar symptoms, including long COVID, as practitioners would be better informed on methodological approaches to adopt, pacing implementation, and expected outcomes. ObjectivesIn this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type of, and outcomes of, pacing in people with ME/CFS. Eligibility criteriaOriginal investigations concerning pacing were considered in participants with ME/CFS. Sources of evidenceSix electronic databases (PubMed, Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) were searched; and websites MEPedia, Action for ME, and ME Action were also searched for grey literature. MethodsA scoping review was conducted. Review selection and characterisation was performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. ResultsAuthors reviewed 177 titles and abstracts, resulting in included 17 studies: three randomised control trials (RCTs); one uncontrolled trial; one interventional case series; one retrospective observational study; two prospective observational studies; four cross-sectional observational studies; and five cross-sectional analytical studies. Studies included variable designs, durations, and outcome measures. In terms of pacing administration, studies used educational sessions and diaries for activity monitoring. Eleven studies reported benefits of pacing, four studies reported no effect, and two studies reported a detrimental effect in comparison to the control group. ConclusionsHighly variable study designs and outcome measures, allied to poor to fair methodological quality resulted in heterogenous findings and highlights the requirement for more research examining pacing. Looking to the long COVID pandemic, future studies should be RCTs utilising objectively quantified digitised pacing, over a longer duration of examination, using the core outcome set for patient reported outcome measures.\nAn After-Action Review of COVID-19 Cases and Mitigation Measures at US Mission India, March 2020-July 2021\nAuthors: Singh, J.; Yadav, R.; Robinson, S.; Vanelli, M.; Nyendak, M.; Desai, M.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294557\nIntroduction Between March 2020-June 2021, over 30 million COVID-19 cases were reported in India. We assessed the COVID-19 response across the US Mission India (US Embassy New Delhi, US Consulates - Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata) to plan future mitigation efforts and fill gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 transmission in a unique community like the US Mission. Method We described COVID-19 mitigation activities undertaken by the five US Mission India posts and conducted a secondary analysis of case investigation and contact tracing program data collected by the Health Unit from March 2020-July 2021. Results US Mission in India, in collaboration with multiple internal agencies, initiated COVID-19 mitigation activities in March 2020. Activities included educational sessions, training for infection prevention and control, health and safety assessments, and the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs). The Health Unit and US CDC India office initiated COVID-19 case investigations and conducted contact tracing. Between March 2020-July 2021, 636 COVID-19 cases (72% males), including 48 clusters (size range 2-10 cases), were reported. Overall case fatality rate was 1.5%. Of case patients, 82% (523) were Indians, and 18% (113) were Americans. On presentation, 22% (138/625) of cases were asymptomatic. The median time from symptom onset to notification to the Health Unit was three days (Interquartile range 1-5). The Health Unit identified 2,484 contacts (positivity rate 25%). Frequency of case presentation in the US Mission India closely resembled the pattern of COVID-19 waves in India. The attack rates ranged over the time period between 10-19%, the highest at 19% in Delhi. Conclusions COVID-19 mitigation strategies were implemented in collaboration with multiple agencies and helped prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and large COVID-19 clusters in the US Mission India.\nRisk of long COVID and associated symptoms after acute SARS-COV-2 infection in ethnic minorities: a Danish nationwide cohort study\nAuthors: Mkoma, G.; Agyemang, C.; Benfield, T. L.; Rostila, M.; Cederström, A.; Petersen, J. H.; Norredam, M.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294402\nBackgroundEthnic minorities living in high-income countries have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of infection rates and hospitalisations; however, less is known about long COVID in this population. Our aim was to examine the risk of long COVID and associated symptoms among ethnic minorities. Methods and FindingsA Danish nationwide register-based cohort study of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 aged [\u0026ge;]18 years (n=2 334 271) between January 2020 and August 2022. We calculated the risk of long COVID diagnosis and long COVID symptoms among ethnic minorities compared with native Danes using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression, respectively. Ethnic minorities from North Africa (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.41; 95% CI 1.12-1.79), Middle East (aHR 1.38; 95% CI 1.24-1.55), Eastern Europe (aHR 1.35; 95% CI 1.22-1.49), and Asia (aHR 1.23; 95% CI 1.09-1.40) had significantly greater risk of long COVID diagnosis than native Danes in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In the analysis by largest countries of origin, the greater risks of long COVID diagnosis were found in Iraqis (aHR 1.56; 95% CI 1.30- 1.88), Turks (aHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.24-1.63), and Somalis (aHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.07-1.91) after adjustment for confounders. Significant factor associated with an increased risk of long COVID diagnosis was COVID-19 hospitalisation. Furthermore, the odds of reporting cardiopulmonary symptoms (including dyspnoea, cough, and chest pain) and any long COVID symptoms were higher among North African, Middle Eastern, Eastern European, and Asian than among native Danes in both unadjusted and adjusted models. ConclusionsBelonging to an ethnic minority group was significantly associated with an increased risk of long COVID indicating the need to better understand long COVID drivers and address care and treatment strategies in this population.\nPrevalence and factors associated with abdominal and total obesity among low-income urban population of Kiambu County, Kenya.\nAuthors: Mbuthia, G. W.; Mwangi, J.; Oguta, J. O.; Akoth, C.; Magutah, K.; Kawira, R.; Nyariki, C.; Kimutai, N.; Kinyua, A.; McGarvey, S. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293819\nObesity is a major risk factor for most non-communicable diseases whose burden has been rising rapidly in low and middle-income countries. To develop public health interventions to address the increasing burden of overweight and obesity, estimates of the prevalence and associated factors are needed in specific populations. The study sought to determine the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity among low-income adults in Kiambu County, Kenya. This community-based cross-sectional survey involved 1656 adults residing in Ruiru and Juja Sub-counties. Data were collected by trained community health volunteers (CHVs) in their respective sub-counties using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The CHVs also took anthropometric measurements using relevant tools and standard procedures. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants characteristics and proportions of adults with obesity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with obesity. The overall prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u003e 30 kg/m2) was 28.8% (95% CI, 26.6%-30.9%), with a higher prevalence observed among women [33.6% (95% CI, 31.1%-36.2%)] than men [12.5% (95% CI, 9.6%-16.3%)]. A third (33.3%) of the participants were overweight (25 \u003c BMI \u003c 30 kg/m2). The prevalence of abdominal obesity as measured by waist-height-ratio (WHtR) was 79.8%, by waist circumference (WC) was 74.0% and by waist-hip-ratio (WHR) was 32%. Obesity was associated with female gender, increasing age, education level and monthly income. In conclusion, the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity was high in the population. Public health strategies focusing on healthy diet, physical activity, weight reduction, and maintenance strategies are urgently needed among low-income adults.\nExperiences of psycho-oncological counselling to support mental health in South Australians diagnosed with cancer\nAuthors: Blunt, J.; Trigg, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.23293728\nBackgroundEffective delivery of psycho-oncological support requires understanding of client perceptions of counselling service effectiveness, psychosocial outcomes, and meeting of client support needs and expectations. ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe perceptions of clients accessing psycho-oncological counselling for people directly or indirectly affected by cancer, and describe perceived psychological distress, depression, and anxiety from pre-to post-counselling. MethodsSouth Australian psycho-oncological counselling service clients were recruited (n=28). Psychological distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed before and after counselling sessions. Client expectations, experiences, and counselling outcomes were examined via pre-post-tests, and thematic analysis. ResultsClients reported reduced anxiety (t=-2.31, p=.029), depression (t=-2.51, p=.018), distress (t=-4.19, p\u003c.0001), and global mental health symptomology (t=-2.79, p=.009). Four themes were identified: having no expectations, needing help managing emotions, seeking coping strategies, and seeking better understanding of their experience. Client expectations were satisfied (92.8%), regardless of counselling reason. ConclusionBenefits of counselling included reduced symptomology, receipt of knowledge and skills, and increased ability to manage everyday life. Supportive counselling significantly reduces distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression while supporting client and family functioning during cancer treatment. ImplicationsIndividual supportive counselling plays an integral role in lives of cancer patients and family members. Clients face concerns relating to cancer prognosis (e.g., recurrence fear), and to broader related experiences (e.g., social dynamics). Complex needs across cancer experience as a patient, carer, or other family member, requires that psycho-oncological counselling targets major client expectations, promotes benefits of counselling, and strategies for managing daily life events.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Post-coronavirus disease (COVID) is widely reported but the data of Post COVID-19 after infection with the Omicron variant is limited. This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (&gt;18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 &#43;54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57&#43;48.33), shortness of breath (131.89&#43;60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59&#43;58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Since early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo establish a SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing programme in an academic institution to analyze saliva samples collected from asymptomatic staff and students.

DesignPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva self-collected by asymptomatic students and staff members from Kings College London, and their household contacts. Standards for diagnostics testing set by the DHSC (UK) were followed to develop an automated saliva PCR service for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Prospective study that run from December 2020 until July 2022.

SettingTesting took place in an academic institution including 18 different locations in London (UK).

ParticipantsThere were no selection criteria; asymptomatic participants were encouraged to test regularly (twice weekly when on campus).

Main outcome measuresNumber of tests, number of participants and positive rate.

Results158,277 PCR tests were carried out on saliva, of which 2,989 were positive (1.89%), collected by 20,186 participants. Between 10-30% of campus footfall were tested. The positive rate was equivalent to that reported by the Office for National Statistics (UK), except for the period encompassing the delta variant; this wave was nearly absent in our cohort. We employed non-commercial reagents and an open source-inspired automated pipeline for sample processing. This rapidly developed service was awarded UKAS accreditation under the ISO15189 standard.

ConclusionsIncluding academic institutions in pandemic preparedness is a critical consideration, considering the experience in developing, validating, and implementing economic and scalable testing solutions. Given the joint ventures in hospital pathology departments across the UK and the move to centralised, automated, commercial tests, focusing on academic centres that can carry out research and development to test for novel and re-emerging pathogens should be a top priority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundControversy over treatment for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a barrier to appropriate treatment. Energy management or pacing is a prominent coping strategy for people with ME/CFS that involves regulating activity to avoid post exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after an activity. Until now, characteristics of pacing, and the effects on patients symptoms had not been systematically reviewed. This is problematic as the most common approach to pacing, pacing prescription, and the pooled efficacy of pacing was unknown. Collating evidence may help advise those suffering with similar symptoms, including long COVID, as practitioners would be better informed on methodological approaches to adopt, pacing implementation, and expected outcomes.

ObjectivesIn this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type of, and outcomes of, pacing in people with ME/CFS.

Eligibility criteriaOriginal investigations concerning pacing were considered in participants with ME/CFS.

Sources of evidenceSix electronic databases (PubMed, Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) were searched; and websites MEPedia, Action for ME, and ME Action were also searched for grey literature.

MethodsA scoping review was conducted. Review selection and characterisation was performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms.

ResultsAuthors reviewed 177 titles and abstracts, resulting in included 17 studies: three randomised control trials (RCTs); one uncontrolled trial; one interventional case series; one retrospective observational study; two prospective observational studies; four cross-sectional observational studies; and five cross-sectional analytical studies. Studies included variable designs, durations, and outcome measures. In terms of pacing administration, studies used educational sessions and diaries for activity monitoring. Eleven studies reported benefits of pacing, four studies reported no effect, and two studies reported a detrimental effect in comparison to the control group.

ConclusionsHighly variable study designs and outcome measures, allied to poor to fair methodological quality resulted in heterogenous findings and highlights the requirement for more research examining pacing. Looking to the long COVID pandemic, future studies should be RCTs utilising objectively quantified digitised pacing, over a longer duration of examination, using the core outcome set for patient reported outcome measures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Between March 2020-June 2021, over 30 million COVID-19 cases were reported in India. We assessed the COVID-19 response across the US Mission India (US Embassy New Delhi, US Consulates - Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata) to plan future mitigation efforts and fill gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 transmission in a unique community like the US Mission. Method We described COVID-19 mitigation activities undertaken by the five US Mission India posts and conducted a secondary analysis of case investigation and contact tracing program data collected by the Health Unit from March 2020-July 2021. Results US Mission in India, in collaboration with multiple internal agencies, initiated COVID-19 mitigation activities in March 2020. Activities included educational sessions, training for infection prevention and control, health and safety assessments, and the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs). The Health Unit and US CDC India office initiated COVID-19 case investigations and conducted contact tracing. Between March 2020-July 2021, 636 COVID-19 cases (72% males), including 48 clusters (size range 2-10 cases), were reported. Overall case fatality rate was 1.5%. Of case patients, 82% (523) were Indians, and 18% (113) were Americans. On presentation, 22% (138/625) of cases were asymptomatic. The median time from symptom onset to notification to the Health Unit was three days (Interquartile range 1-5). The Health Unit identified 2,484 contacts (positivity rate 25%). Frequency of case presentation in the US Mission India closely resembled the pattern of COVID-19 waves in India. The attack rates ranged over the time period between 10-19%, the highest at 19% in Delhi. Conclusions COVID-19 mitigation strategies were implemented in collaboration with multiple agencies and helped prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and large COVID-19 clusters in the US Mission India.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEthnic minorities living in high-income countries have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of infection rates and hospitalisations; however, less is known about long COVID in this population. Our aim was to examine the risk of long COVID and associated symptoms among ethnic minorities.

Methods and FindingsA Danish nationwide register-based cohort study of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 aged [&amp;ge;]18 years (n=2 334 271) between January 2020 and August 2022. We calculated the risk of long COVID diagnosis and long COVID symptoms among ethnic minorities compared with native Danes using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression, respectively.

Ethnic minorities from North Africa (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.41; 95% CI 1.12-1.79), Middle East (aHR 1.38; 95% CI 1.24-1.55), Eastern Europe (aHR 1.35; 95% CI 1.22-1.49), and Asia (aHR 1.23; 95% CI 1.09-1.40) had significantly greater risk of long COVID diagnosis than native Danes in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In the analysis by largest countries of origin, the greater risks of long COVID diagnosis were found in Iraqis (aHR 1.56; 95% CI 1.30- 1.88), Turks (aHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.24-1.63), and Somalis (aHR 1.42; 95% CI 1.07-1.91) after adjustment for confounders. Significant factor associated with an increased risk of long COVID diagnosis was COVID-19 hospitalisation. Furthermore, the odds of reporting cardiopulmonary symptoms (including dyspnoea, cough, and chest pain) and any long COVID symptoms were higher among North African, Middle Eastern, Eastern European, and Asian than among native Danes in both unadjusted and adjusted models.

ConclusionsBelonging to an ethnic minority group was significantly associated with an increased risk of long COVID indicating the need to better understand long COVID drivers and address care and treatment strategies in this population.</p>

To develop public health interventions to address the increasing burden of overweight and obesity, estimates of the prevalence and associated factors are needed in specific populations. The study sought to determine the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity among low-income adults in Kiambu County, Kenya. This community-based cross-sectional survey involved 1656 adults residing in Ruiru and Juja Sub-counties. Data were collected by trained community health volunteers (CHVs) in their respective sub-counties using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The CHVs also took anthropometric measurements using relevant tools and standard procedures. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants characteristics and proportions of adults with obesity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with obesity. The overall prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2) was 28.8% (95% CI, 26.6%-30.9%), with a higher prevalence observed among women [33.6% (95% CI, 31.1%-36.2%)] than men [12.5% (95% CI, 9.6%-16.3%)]. A third (33.3%) of the participants were overweight (25 &lt; BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2). The prevalence of abdominal obesity as measured by waist-height-ratio (WHtR) was 79.8%, by waist circumference (WC) was 74.0% and by waist-hip-ratio (WHR) was 32%. Obesity was associated with female gender, increasing age, education level and monthly income. In conclusion, the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity was high in the population. Public health strategies focusing on healthy diet, physical activity, weight reduction, and maintenance strategies are urgently needed among low-income adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEffective delivery of psycho-oncological support requires understanding of client perceptions of counselling service effectiveness, psychosocial outcomes, and meeting of client support needs and expectations.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe perceptions of clients accessing psycho-oncological counselling for people directly or indirectly affected by cancer, and describe perceived psychological distress, depression, and anxiety from pre-to post-counselling.

MethodsSouth Australian psycho-oncological counselling service clients were recruited (n=28). Psychological distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed before and after counselling sessions. Client expectations, experiences, and counselling outcomes were examined via pre-post-tests, and thematic analysis.

ResultsClients reported reduced anxiety (t=-2.31, p=.029), depression (t=-2.51, p=.018), distress (t=-4.19, p&lt;.0001), and global mental health symptomology (t=-2.79, p=.009). Four themes were identified: having no expectations, needing help managing emotions, seeking coping strategies, and seeking better understanding of their experience. Client expectations were satisfied (92.8%), regardless of counselling reason.

ConclusionBenefits of counselling included reduced symptomology, receipt of knowledge and skills, and increased ability to manage everyday life. Supportive counselling significantly reduces distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression while supporting client and family functioning during cancer treatment.

ImplicationsIndividual supportive counselling plays an integral role in lives of cancer patients and family members. Clients face concerns relating to cancer prognosis (e.g., recurrence fear), and to broader related experiences (e.g., social dynamics). Complex needs across cancer experience as a patient, carer, or other family member, requires that psycho-oncological counselling targets major client expectations, promotes benefits of counselling, and strategies for managing daily life events.</p>
