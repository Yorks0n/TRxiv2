B.; Chiwaula, M.; Chavula, Y.; Bukhu, M.; Manda, H.; Chitenje, M.; Malolo, I.; Mwanyongo, A.; Mvula, B.; Nyenje, M.; de Oliveira, T.; Kagoli, M.\nScore: 62.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294324\nSince early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.\nEstimating the population effectiveness of interventions against COVID-19 in France: a modelling study\nAuthors: Ganser, I.; Buckeridge, D. L.; Heffernan, J. M.; Prague, M.; Thiebaut, R.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295425\nBackground Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines have been widely used to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty persists regarding the effectiveness of these interventions due to data quality issues, methodological challenges, and differing contextual factors. Accurate estimation of their effects is crucial for future epidemic preparedness. Methods To address this, we developed a population-based mechanistic model that includes the impact of NPIs and vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospitalization rates. Our statistical approach estimated all parameters in one step, accurately propagating uncertainty. We fitted the model to comprehensive epidemiological data in France from March 2020 to October 2021. With the same model, we simulated scenarios of vaccine rollout. Results The first lockdown was the most effective, reducing transmission by 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83-85). Subsequent lockdowns had diminished effectiveness (reduction of 74% (69-77) and 11% (9-18), respectively). A 6pm curfew was more effective than one at 8 pm (68% (66-69) vs. 48% (45-49) reduction), while school closures reduced transmission by 15% (12-18). In a scenario without vaccines before November 2021, we predicted 159,000 or 194% (95% prediction interval (PI) 74-424) more deaths and 1,488,000 or 340% (136-689) more hospitalizations. If a vaccine had been available after 100 days, over 71,000 deaths (16,507-204,249) and 384,000 (88,579-1,020,386) hospitalizations could have been averted. Conclusion Our results highlight the substantial impact of NPIs, including lockdowns and curfews, in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. We also demonstrate the value of the 100 days objective of the CEPI initiative for vaccine availability.\nSARS-CoV-2 quarantine mandated by contact tracing: burden and infection rate among close contacts in Zurich, Switzerland, 2020-2021\nAuthors: Aschmann, H. E.; Domenghino, A.; Jung, R.; Ballouz, T.; Menges, D.; Fehr, J.; Puhan, M. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294798\nObjectivesBefore vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MethodsWe invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests, during and at the end of quarantine. ResultsAmong 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%-14.7%] were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported quarantine was very or extremely difficult. ConclusionsAlthough quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.\nVitamin D deficiency and toxicity across 2018 to 2022 in several cities of Ecuador: interrupted time series and a cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Zurita-Salinas, C.; Tello, B.; Duenas Espin, I.; Zurita, J.; Acosta-Naranjo, W.; Aguilera-Leon, C.; Andrade-Munoz, J.; Pareja-Maldonado, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295127\nObjectivesto identify differences in mean vitamin D concentrations in samples obtained from a private laboratory in the city of Quito, and to explore their relationship with the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods spanning from 2018 to 2022. DesignA combination of an interrupted time series design and a retrospective cross-sectional approach Setting and participantsThe study involved 9,285 participants who had their 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels tested at a well-known private laboratory in Quito, Ecuador, from 2018 to 2022. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The 25(OH)D levels were analyzed and assessed for correlations with both age and the year in which the measurements were taken. ResultsThe mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level was 27.53 ng/mL ({+/-} 14.11). Approximately 64.58% of participants had insufficient levels, below 20 ng/mL, and 0.62% showed potential harm from excess 25(OH)D, with levels over 100 ng/mL. The analysis indicated a significant monthly increase of 0.133 units in 25(OH)D levels (p=0.006). However, the period after March 2020, compared to before, saw a non-significant decrease of 1.605 units in mean 25(OH)D levels (p=0.477). ConclusionsThe studys findings indicate a significant prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency, underscoring the necessity for preventative measures. Nevertheless, the rise in cases of vitamin D toxicity is concerning, emphasizing the importance of prudent vitamin D supplement prescriptions and public education against self-medication. For efficient resource allocation and targeting those with higher risks, it may be advantageous to concentrate vitamin D testing on specific population groups.\nAssessing the Economic Burden of Alcohol Use in India Compared to Excise Taxes on Alcohol Sales\nAuthors: Zadey, S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295088\nBackgroundAlcohol use is among the topmost public health risk factors. There is a dearth of evidence on the broader impact of alcohol use on society, especially, for lower-middle-income countries like India. We retrospectively studied the economic burden of alcohol use and compared it with revenue from excise taxes on alcohol sales for India and its states in 2019. MethodsFor estimating the overall alcohol-attributable disease burden, disability-adjusted life-years or DALYs for India and its 30 states were extracted for all causes, all age groups, and both sexes with alcohol use as a risk factor from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study. Economic burden was calculated by the value of life-year (VLY) or full-income approach. National and state-level (top 10 revenue-earning states) data on excise taxes on alcohol sales were acquired from the Reserve Bank of India. Net losses were assessed by subtracting the revenue from the economic burden. All values are in Indian rupees (INR). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different discount rates (0%, 3%, and 7%) for VLY values while uncertainty was propagated using 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for DALYs. ResultsThe economic burden of alcohol use in India was 6.2 (95% UI: 4.8, 7.8) trillion INR in 2019. State-level burden varied from 7.3 (4.7, 10.4) billion INR in Mizoram to 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) trillion INR in Maharashtra. Nationally, revenue was 1.8 trillion INR depicting a net loss of 4.4 (3.1, 6.0) trillion. Net loss was largest in Maharashtra and smallest in Telangana. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that all ten states depicted losses in the case of a 3% discount rate, while five and seven states showed losses at 0% and 7% discount rates. ConclusionThese are novel subnational estimates depicting annual net losses due to alcohol use in India with direct policy implications to disincentivize alcohol sales and raise taxes to an adequate level. HighlightsO_LIThe annual economic burden of alcohol use in India runs over six trillion rupees. C_LIO_LIEconomic burden exceeds revenue from excise taxes noting net loss. C_LIO_LIEconomic burden varies across states with Maharashtra having the largest burden. C_LIO_LIAll of the top ten revenue-earning states depict net losses in primary analysis.

Study Protocol for a Prospective, Longitudinal Observational Study.\nAuthors: Wasan, Y.; Baxter, J.-A. B.; Spiegel-Feld, C.; Begum, K.; Rizvi, A.; Iqbal, J.; Hulst, J. M.; Bandsma, R.; Suleman, S.; Soofi, S. B.; Parkinson, J.; Bhutta, Z. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295048\nBackgroundNutritional status critically contributes to maternal and child morbidities and mortality. Undernutrition during pregnancy and preconception is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and has downstream effects on the growth and development of children. The gut microbiome has a profound influence on the nutritional status of the host. Dysbiosis has emerged as a major factor in the development of malnutrition. This phenomenon is understudied in settings with a high prevalence of undernutrition, and further investigation is warranted to better understand such interactions. MethodsThe study is a prospective, longitudinal observational study to investigate the impact and relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the gut and their association with maternal health and birth outcomes among young women, 17-24 years of age in Matiari District, Pakistan. We aim to enroll 400 pregnant women with low and normal BMIs at the time of recruitment (\u003c16 weeks of gestation). Data collection includes demographics, morbidities, medication use, empowerment, dietary recall, and anthropometrics. Stool and blood specimens are collected at several time points for different laboratory assays. DiscussionLimited studies have examined the role of the microbiome in maternal health and birth outcomes where the prevalence of undernutrition is high. Here we aim to investigate the interplay of maternal and child undernutrition with the composition (diversity) and functionality of the gut microbiome and capture how it is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the understanding of undernutrition. Study registrationThe study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05108675.\nBivalent mRNA vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in Portugal: a cohort study based on electronic health records, September 2022 to May 2023\nAuthors: Machado, A.; Kislaya, I.; Soares, P.; Magalhaes, S.; Rodrigues, A. P.; Franco, R.; Leite, P. P.; Dias, C. M.; Nunes, B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295025\nIn Portugal, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster was recommended for those with complete primary COVID-19 vaccination, starting on September 6 2022. This study aims to estimate the mRNA bivalent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death in the Portuguese population aged 65 and more years with a follow-up of more than six months. MethodsWe used a cohort approach to analyse six electronic health registries using deterministic linkage. The follow-up period comprehend September 2022 to May 2023. The outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. Individuals were considered vaccinated 14 days following a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine uptake. For each outcome, COVID-19 bivalent VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio of bivalent vaccine vs no bivalent vaccine, estimated by Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure. ResultsIn the [\u0026ge;] 80 year-olds, bivalent VE was 23.2 (95%CI: 20.1 to 26.2), 41.3 (95%CI: 34.5 to 47.5) and 50.3 (44.6 to 55.3), against infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, respectively. In the 65-79 year-old, bivalent VE against infection was 37.7 (35.5 to 39.8), 58.5 (95%CI: 51.9 to 64.2) against hospitalisation and 65.1 (95%CI: 59 to 70.4) against death. Vaccine effectiveness decay was observed for both age groups and in all outcomes, up to 6 months of vaccine uptake. ConclusionsIn a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed moderate bivalent VE estimates against severe COVID-19 and low protection against infection. The lower VE estimates observed in the [\u0026ge;] 80 year-olds should be interpreted in light of the reference group used for the estimation, i.e., individuals with high vaccine coverage (both primary series and multiple boosters). Significant VE decay was observed up to six months of vaccine uptake, which should be considered when preparing future vaccination campaigns.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Since early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines have been widely used to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty persists regarding the effectiveness of these interventions due to data quality issues, methodological challenges, and differing contextual factors. Accurate estimation of their effects is crucial for future epidemic preparedness. Methods To address this, we developed a population-based mechanistic model that includes the impact of NPIs and vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospitalization rates. Our statistical approach estimated all parameters in one step, accurately propagating uncertainty. We fitted the model to comprehensive epidemiological data in France from March 2020 to October 2021. With the same model, we simulated scenarios of vaccine rollout. Results The first lockdown was the most effective, reducing transmission by 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83-85). Subsequent lockdowns had diminished effectiveness (reduction of 74% (69-77) and 11% (9-18), respectively). A 6pm curfew was more effective than one at 8 pm (68% (66-69) vs. 48% (45-49) reduction), while school closures reduced transmission by 15% (12-18). In a scenario without vaccines before November 2021, we predicted 159,000 or 194% (95% prediction interval (PI) 74-424) more deaths and 1,488,000 or 340% (136-689) more hospitalizations. If a vaccine had been available after 100 days, over 71,000 deaths (16,507-204,249) and 384,000 (88,579-1,020,386) hospitalizations could have been averted. Conclusion Our results highlight the substantial impact of NPIs, including lockdowns and curfews, in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. We also demonstrate the value of the 100 days objective of the CEPI initiative for vaccine availability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesBefore vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests, during and at the end of quarantine.

ResultsAmong 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%-14.7%] were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported quarantine was very or extremely difficult.

ConclusionsAlthough quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objectivesto identify differences in mean vitamin D concentrations in samples obtained from a private laboratory in the city of Quito, and to explore their relationship with the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods spanning from 2018 to 2022.

DesignA combination of an interrupted time series design and a retrospective cross-sectional approach

Setting and participantsThe study involved 9,285 participants who had their 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels tested at a well-known private laboratory in Quito, Ecuador, from 2018 to 2022.

Primary and secondary outcome measures: The 25(OH)D levels were analyzed and assessed for correlations with both age and the year in which the measurements were taken.

ResultsThe mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level was 27.53 ng/mL ({&#43;/-} 14.11). Approximately 64.58% of participants had insufficient levels, below 20 ng/mL, and 0.62% showed potential harm from excess 25(OH)D, with levels over 100 ng/mL. The analysis indicated a significant monthly increase of 0.133 units in 25(OH)D levels (p=0.006). However, the period after March 2020, compared to before, saw a non-significant decrease of 1.605 units in mean 25(OH)D levels (p=0.477).

ConclusionsThe studys findings indicate a significant prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency, underscoring the necessity for preventative measures. Nevertheless, the rise in cases of vitamin D toxicity is concerning, emphasizing the importance of prudent vitamin D supplement prescriptions and public education against self-medication. For efficient resource allocation and targeting those with higher risks, it may be advantageous to concentrate vitamin D testing on specific population groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlcohol use is among the topmost public health risk factors. There is a dearth of evidence on the broader impact of alcohol use on society, especially, for lower-middle-income countries like India. We retrospectively studied the economic burden of alcohol use and compared it with revenue from excise taxes on alcohol sales for India and its states in 2019.

MethodsFor estimating the overall alcohol-attributable disease burden, disability-adjusted life-years or DALYs for India and its 30 states were extracted for all causes, all age groups, and both sexes with alcohol use as a risk factor from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study. Economic burden was calculated by the value of life-year (VLY) or full-income approach. National and state-level (top 10 revenue-earning states) data on excise taxes on alcohol sales were acquired from the Reserve Bank of India. Net losses were assessed by subtracting the revenue from the economic burden. All values are in Indian rupees (INR). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different discount rates (0%, 3%, and 7%) for VLY values while uncertainty was propagated using 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for DALYs.

ResultsThe economic burden of alcohol use in India was 6.2 (95% UI: 4.8, 7.8) trillion INR in 2019. State-level burden varied from 7.3 (4.7, 10.4) billion INR in Mizoram to 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) trillion INR in Maharashtra. Nationally, revenue was 1.8 trillion INR depicting a net loss of 4.4 (3.1, 6.0) trillion. Net loss was largest in Maharashtra and smallest in Telangana. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that all ten states depicted losses in the case of a 3% discount rate, while five and seven states showed losses at 0% and 7% discount rates.

ConclusionThese are novel subnational estimates depicting annual net losses due to alcohol use in India with direct policy implications to disincentivize alcohol sales and raise taxes to an adequate level.

HighlightsO_LIThe annual economic burden of alcohol use in India runs over six trillion rupees.
C_LIO_LIEconomic burden exceeds revenue from excise taxes noting net loss.
C_LIO_LIEconomic burden varies across states with Maharashtra having the largest burden.
C_LIO_LIAll of the top ten revenue-earning states depict net losses in primary analysis.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNutritional status critically contributes to maternal and child morbidities and mortality. Undernutrition during pregnancy and preconception is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and has downstream effects on the growth and development of children. The gut microbiome has a profound influence on the nutritional status of the host. Dysbiosis has emerged as a major factor in the development of malnutrition. This phenomenon is understudied in settings with a high prevalence of undernutrition, and further investigation is warranted to better understand such interactions.

MethodsThe study is a prospective, longitudinal observational study to investigate the impact and relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the gut and their association with maternal health and birth outcomes among young women, 17-24 years of age in Matiari District, Pakistan. We aim to enroll 400 pregnant women with low and normal BMIs at the time of recruitment (&lt;16 weeks of gestation). Data collection includes demographics, morbidities, medication use, empowerment, dietary recall, and anthropometrics. Stool and blood specimens are collected at several time points for different laboratory assays.

DiscussionLimited studies have examined the role of the microbiome in maternal health and birth outcomes where the prevalence of undernutrition is high. Here we aim to investigate the interplay of maternal and child undernutrition with the composition (diversity) and functionality of the gut microbiome and capture how it is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the understanding of undernutrition.

Study registrationThe study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05108675.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Portugal, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster was recommended for those with complete primary COVID-19 vaccination, starting on September 6 2022. This study aims to estimate the mRNA bivalent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death in the Portuguese population aged 65 and more years with a follow-up of more than six months.

MethodsWe used a cohort approach to analyse six electronic health registries using deterministic linkage. The follow-up period comprehend September 2022 to May 2023. The outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. Individuals were considered vaccinated 14 days following a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine uptake. For each outcome, COVID-19 bivalent VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio of bivalent vaccine vs no bivalent vaccine, estimated by Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure.

ResultsIn the [&amp;ge;] 80 year-olds, bivalent VE was 23.2 (95%CI: 20.1 to 26.2), 41.3 (95%CI: 34.5 to 47.5) and 50.3 (44.6 to 55.3), against infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, respectively. In the 65-79 year-old, bivalent VE against infection was 37.7 (35.5 to 39.8), 58.5 (95%CI: 51.9 to 64.2) against hospitalisation and 65.1 (95%CI: 59 to 70.4) against death. Vaccine effectiveness decay was observed for both age groups and in all outcomes, up to 6 months of vaccine uptake.

ConclusionsIn a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed moderate bivalent VE estimates against severe COVID-19 and low protection against infection. The lower VE estimates observed in the [&amp;ge;] 80 year-olds should be interpreted in light of the reference group used for the estimation, i.e., individuals with high vaccine coverage (both primary series and multiple boosters). Significant VE decay was observed up to six months of vaccine uptake, which should be considered when preparing future vaccination campaigns.</p>
