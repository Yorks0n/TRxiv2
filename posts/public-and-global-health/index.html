We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.\nPrevalence and pattern of Post Covid-19 symptoms in recovered patients of Delhi: A Population-Based study\nAuthors: Bhatnagar, N.; Singh, M. M.; Sharma, H.; Mishra, S.; Singh, G.; Rao, S.; Borle, A.; Anand, T.; Kumar, N.; Goswami, B.; Singh, S.; Kapoor, M.; Singla, S.; Khuraijam, B.; Khurana, N.; Sharma, U.; Garg, S.\nScore: 39.4, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294654\nBackgroundPost-coronavirus disease (COVID) is widely reported but the data of Post COVID-19 after infection with the Omicron variant is limited. This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (\u003e18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 {+/-}54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57{+/-}48.33), shortness of breath (131.89{+/-}60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59{+/-}58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.\nKCL TEST: an open-source inspired asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programme in an academic institution\nAuthors: Reis de Andrade, J.; Scourfield, E.; Peswani-Sajnani, S.; Poulton, K.; Ap Rees, T.; Khooshmehri, P.; Doherty, G.; Ong, S.; Ivan, I.; Goudarzi, N.; Gardiner, I.; Caine, E.; Maguire, T. J. A.; Leightley, D.; Torrico, L.; Gasulla, A.; Menendez-Vazquez, A.; Ortega Prieto, A. M.; Pickering, S.; Jimenez Guardeno, J.; Tan, A. V. F.; Griffin, A.; Papaioannou, S.; Trouillet, C.; Mischo, H.; Giralt, V.; Wilson, S.; Kirk, M.; Neil, S.; Ribeiro Galao, R. P.; Martindale, J.; Curtis, C.; Zuckerman, M.; Razavi, R.; Malim, M. H.; Martinez-Nunez, R. T.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293154\nObjectivesTo establish a SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing programme in an academic institution to analyze saliva samples collected from asymptomatic staff and students. DesignPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva self-collected by asymptomatic students and staff members from Kings College London, and their household contacts. Standards for diagnostics testing set by the DHSC (UK) were followed to develop an automated saliva PCR service for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Prospective study that run from December 2020 until July 2022. SettingTesting took place in an academic institution including 18 different locations in London (UK). ParticipantsThere were no selection criteria; asymptomatic participants were encouraged to test regularly (twice weekly when on campus). Main outcome measuresNumber of tests, number of participants and positive rate. Results158,277 PCR tests were carried out on saliva, of which 2,989 were positive (1.89%), collected by 20,186 participants. Between 10-30% of campus footfall were tested. The positive rate was equivalent to that reported by the Office for National Statistics (UK), except for the period encompassing the delta variant; this wave was nearly absent in our cohort. We employed non-commercial reagents and an open source-inspired automated pipeline for sample processing. This rapidly developed service was awarded UKAS accreditation under the ISO15189 standard. ConclusionsIncluding academic institutions in pandemic preparedness is a critical consideration, considering the experience in developing, validating, and implementing economic and scalable testing solutions. Given the joint ventures in hospital pathology departments across the UK and the move to centralised, automated, commercial tests, focusing on academic centres that can carry out research and development to test for novel and re-emerging pathogens should be a top priority.\nPrevalence and factors associated with abdominal and total obesity among low-income urban population of Kiambu County, Kenya.\nAuthors: Mbuthia, G. W.; Mwangi, J.; Oguta, J. O.; Akoth, C.; Magutah, K.; Kawira, R.; Nyariki, C.; Kimutai, N.; Kinyua, A.; McGarvey, S. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293819\nObesity is a major risk factor for most non-communicable diseases whose burden has been rising rapidly in low and middle-income countries. To develop public health interventions to address the increasing burden of overweight and obesity, estimates of the prevalence and associated factors are needed in specific populations. The study sought to determine the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity among low-income adults in Kiambu County, Kenya. This community-based cross-sectional survey involved 1656 adults residing in Ruiru and Juja Sub-counties. Data were collected by trained community health volunteers (CHVs) in their respective sub-counties using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The CHVs also took anthropometric measurements using relevant tools and standard procedures. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants characteristics and proportions of adults with obesity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with obesity. The overall prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u003e 30 kg/m2) was 28.8% (95% CI, 26.6%-30.9%), with a higher prevalence observed among women [33.6% (95% CI, 31.1%-36.2%)] than men [12.5% (95% CI, 9.6%-16.3%)]. A third (33.3%) of the participants were overweight (25 \u003c BMI \u003c 30 kg/m2). The prevalence of abdominal obesity as measured by waist-height-ratio (WHtR) was 79.8%, by waist circumference (WC) was 74.0% and by waist-hip-ratio (WHR) was 32%. Obesity was associated with female gender, increasing age, education level and monthly income. In conclusion, the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity was high in the population. Public health strategies focusing on healthy diet, physical activity, weight reduction, and maintenance strategies are urgently needed among low-income adults.\nParental intention, attitudes, beliefs, trust and deliberation towards childhood vaccination in the Netherlands in 2022: Indications of change compared to 2013\nAuthors: Knijff, M.; van Lier, A.; Boer, M.; de Vries, M.; Hament, J.-M.; de Melker, H. E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23291934\nBackground and aimVaccine uptake within the Dutch National Immunisation Programme (NIP) has slightly declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied psychosocial factors of vaccine uptake, namely parental intention, attitudes, beliefs, trust and deliberation (i.e., self-evidence), before (2013) and two years into the pandemic (2022). MethodsIn 2022 and 2013, parents with a young child (aged \u003c3.5 years) participated in online surveys on vaccination (n=1,000 and 800, (estimated) response=12.2% and 37.2%, respectively). Psychosocial factors were measured on 7-point Likert scales. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study differences between parents in 2022 and 2013 in negative scores ([\u0026le;]2) of psychosocial factors. ResultsIn both 2022 and 2013, most parents with a young child expressed positive intention (2022=83.1%, 2013=87.0%), attitudes (3 items: 2022=66.7%-70.9%, 2013=62.1%-69.8%) and trust (2022=51.8%, 2013=52.0%) towards the NIP and felt that vaccinating their child was self-evident (2022=57.2%, 2013=67.3%). Compared to parents with a young child in 2013, parents with a young child in 2022 had significantly higher odds of reporting negative attitudes towards vaccination (3 items combined: OR=2.84), believing that vaccinations offer insufficient protection (OR=4.89), that the NIP is not beneficial for the protection of their childs health (OR=2.23), that vaccinating their child does not necessarily protect the health of other children (OR=2.24) or adults (OR=2.22) and that vaccinations could cause severe side effects (OR=2.20), preferring natural infection over vaccination (OR=3.18) and reporting low trust towards the NIP (OR=1.73). ConclusionsAlthough most parents had positive intention, attitudes and trust towards vaccination and perceived vaccinating their child as self-evident, proportions of parents with negative scores were slightly larger in 2022 compared to 2013. Monitoring these determinants of vaccine uptake and developing appropriate interventions could contribute to sustaining high vaccine uptake.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Since early 2022, in the aftermath of two extreme weather events, Malawi experienced its largest ever cholera outbreak, with over 58,000 reported cases and 1,761 deaths as of May 2023. We generated 49 high-quality, near-complete Vibrio cholerae genomes in Malawi from isolates collected between December 2022 and March 2023 from all three regions of Malawi. Using phylogenetic methods with 2159 publicly available genomes, we present evidence suggesting that the Malawi outbreak strains originated from the Pakistan outbreak, the estimated most recent ancestor of this lineage, named T15, was during the Pakistan floods, and once introduced into Malawi was exacerbated by major floods between June and October 2022. The extreme weather events and humanitarian crises in Malawi provided the environment for the spread of Vibrio cholerae, and the subsequent movement of large numbers of people may have facilitated its spread to susceptible populations in areas relatively unaffected by cholera for over a decade.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-coronavirus disease (COVID) is widely reported but the data of Post COVID-19 after infection with the Omicron variant is limited. This prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence, pattern, and duration of symptoms related to Covid-19 recovered patients. Methods: Adults (&gt;18 years old) in 11 districts of Delhi who had recovered from Covid-19 were followed up at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Results: The study found that the participants had a mean age of 42.07 years, with a standard deviation of 14.89. Additionally, a significant proportion of the participants (79.7%) experienced post-Covid symptoms. The participants elicited a history of Joint Pain (36%), Persistent dry cough (35.7%), anxiousness (28.4%) and shortness of breath (27.1%). The other symptoms reported were persistent fatigue (21.6%), persistent headache (20%), forgetfulness (19.7%) and weakness in limbs (18.6%). The longest duration of symptom was observed in participants reporting anxiousness (138.75 {&#43;/-}54.14) followed by fatigue (137.57{&#43;/-}48.33), shortness of breath (131.89{&#43;/-}60.21) and joint pain/swelling (131.59{&#43;/-}58.76). During the first follow-up, 2.2% of participants had an abnormal ECG reading, while no abnormalities were reported during the second follow-up. Additionally, 4.06% of participants had abnormal chest X-ray findings during the first follow-up, with this number decreasing to 2.16% during the second follow-up. Conclusion: Our study concluded that the clinical symptoms persist in participants until 6 months and a multi-system involvement is seen in the post-COVID period. Thus, the findings necessitate long-term, regular follow-ups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo establish a SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing programme in an academic institution to analyze saliva samples collected from asymptomatic staff and students.

DesignPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva self-collected by asymptomatic students and staff members from Kings College London, and their household contacts. Standards for diagnostics testing set by the DHSC (UK) were followed to develop an automated saliva PCR service for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Prospective study that run from December 2020 until July 2022.

SettingTesting took place in an academic institution including 18 different locations in London (UK).

ParticipantsThere were no selection criteria; asymptomatic participants were encouraged to test regularly (twice weekly when on campus).

Main outcome measuresNumber of tests, number of participants and positive rate.

Results158,277 PCR tests were carried out on saliva, of which 2,989 were positive (1.89%), collected by 20,186 participants. Between 10-30% of campus footfall were tested. The positive rate was equivalent to that reported by the Office for National Statistics (UK), except for the period encompassing the delta variant; this wave was nearly absent in our cohort. We employed non-commercial reagents and an open source-inspired automated pipeline for sample processing. This rapidly developed service was awarded UKAS accreditation under the ISO15189 standard.

ConclusionsIncluding academic institutions in pandemic preparedness is a critical consideration, considering the experience in developing, validating, and implementing economic and scalable testing solutions. Given the joint ventures in hospital pathology departments across the UK and the move to centralised, automated, commercial tests, focusing on academic centres that can carry out research and development to test for novel and re-emerging pathogens should be a top priority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a major risk factor for most non-communicable diseases whose burden has been rising rapidly in low and middle-income countries. To develop public health interventions to address the increasing burden of overweight and obesity, estimates of the prevalence and associated factors are needed in specific populations. The study sought to determine the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity among low-income adults in Kiambu County, Kenya. This community-based cross-sectional survey involved 1656 adults residing in Ruiru and Juja Sub-counties. Data were collected by trained community health volunteers (CHVs) in their respective sub-counties using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The CHVs also took anthropometric measurements using relevant tools and standard procedures. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants characteristics and proportions of adults with obesity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with obesity. The overall prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2) was 28.8% (95% CI, 26.6%-30.9%), with a higher prevalence observed among women [33.6% (95% CI, 31.1%-36.2%)] than men [12.5% (95% CI, 9.6%-16.3%)]. A third (33.3%) of the participants were overweight (25 &lt; BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2). The prevalence of abdominal obesity as measured by waist-height-ratio (WHtR) was 79.8%, by waist circumference (WC) was 74.0% and by waist-hip-ratio (WHR) was 32%. Obesity was associated with female gender, increasing age, education level and monthly income. In conclusion, the prevalence of total obesity and abdominal obesity was high in the population. Public health strategies focusing on healthy diet, physical activity, weight reduction, and maintenance strategies are urgently needed among low-income adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimVaccine uptake within the Dutch National Immunisation Programme (NIP) has slightly declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied psychosocial factors of vaccine uptake, namely parental intention, attitudes, beliefs, trust and deliberation (i.e., self-evidence), before (2013) and two years into the pandemic (2022).

MethodsIn 2022 and 2013, parents with a young child (aged &lt;3.5 years) participated in online surveys on vaccination (n=1,000 and 800, (estimated) response=12.2% and 37.2%, respectively). Psychosocial factors were measured on 7-point Likert scales. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study differences between parents in 2022 and 2013 in  negative scores ([&amp;le;]2) of psychosocial factors.

ResultsIn both 2022 and 2013, most parents with a young child expressed positive intention (2022=83.1%, 2013=87.0%), attitudes (3 items: 2022=66.7%-70.9%, 2013=62.1%-69.8%) and trust (2022=51.8%, 2013=52.0%) towards the NIP and felt that vaccinating their child was self-evident (2022=57.2%, 2013=67.3%). Compared to parents with a young child in 2013, parents with a young child in 2022 had significantly higher odds of reporting negative attitudes towards vaccination (3 items combined: OR=2.84), believing that vaccinations offer insufficient protection (OR=4.89), that the NIP is not beneficial for the protection of their childs health (OR=2.23), that vaccinating their child does not necessarily protect the health of other children (OR=2.24) or adults (OR=2.22) and that vaccinations could cause severe side effects (OR=2.20), preferring natural infection over vaccination (OR=3.18) and reporting low trust towards the NIP (OR=1.73).

ConclusionsAlthough most parents had positive intention, attitudes and trust towards vaccination and perceived vaccinating their child as self-evident, proportions of parents with negative scores were slightly larger in 2022 compared to 2013. Monitoring these determinants of vaccine uptake and developing appropriate interventions could contribute to sustaining high vaccine uptake.</p>
