Projections until 2050, under a medium climate change (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5), show a 9.6% mean increase in endemic area size for zoonotic/vector-borne diseases globally (n=101), with expansions common across continents and priority pathogen groups. Range shifts of host and vector animal species appear to drive higher disease risk for many areas near the poles by 2050 and beyond. Projections using lower climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6 \u0026 4.5) indicated similar or slightly worse future population exposure trends than higher scenarios (RCP 6.0 \u0026 8.5), possibly due to host and vector species being unable to track faster climatic changes. Socioeconomic development trajectories, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), mediate future risk through a combination of climate and demographic change, which will disrupt current, regional patterns of disease burden. Overall, our study suggests that climate change will likely exacerbate global animal-borne disease risk, emphasising the need to consider climate change as a health threat.

M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301941\nBarriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, \"WASH\") in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.\nOptimizing test and treat options for vivax malaria: an options assessment toolkit (OAT) for Asia Pacific National Malaria Control Programs\nAuthors: Acharya, S.; Shrestha, M.; Thang, N. D.; Wini, L.; Habib, M. N.; Neukom, J.; Lhazeen, K.; Lynch, C. A.; Thriemer, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.24302447\nIntroductionDesigning policy in public health is a complex process requiring decision making that incorporates available evidence and is suitable to a countrys epidemiological and health system context. The main objective of this study was to develop an options assessment toolkit (OAT) to provide a pragmatic and evidence-based approach to the development of policies for the radical cure (prevention of relapse) of vivax malaria for national malaria control programs in the Asia-Pacific region. Materials and methodsThe OAT was developed using participatory research methods and a Delphi process using a sequential multi-phase design, adapted with a pre-development phase, a development phase, and a final development phase. In the pre-development phase, a literature review was conducted to inform the toolkit development. Data collection in the development phase consisted of core research team discussions, multiple rounds of consultation with participants from National Malaria Control Programs (NMP) (online and in person), and two separate modified e-Delphi processes with experts. The final development phase was the piloting of the toolkit during the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) Vivax Working Group. ResultsWe developed a tool kit containing the following elements: i) Baseline Assessment Tool (BAT) to assess the readiness of NMPs for new or improved coverage of radical cure, ii) eight scenarios representative of Asia Pacific region, iii) matching test and treat options based on available options for G6PD testing and radical cure for the given scenarios, iv) an approaches tool to allow NMPs to visualize considerations for policy change process and different implementation strategies/approaches for each test and treat option. ConclusionsThe OAT can support vivax radical cure policy formulation among NMPs and stakeholders tailoring for their unique country context. Future studies are needed to assess the utility and practicality of using the OAT for specific country context.\nCross-disciplinary rapid scoping review of structural racial and caste discrimination associated with population health disparities in the 21st Century\nAuthors: Rasali, D. P.; WOODRUFF, B. M.; ALZYOUD, F. A.; KIEL, D.; SCHAFFZIN, K. T.; OSEI, W. D.; FORD, C. L.; JOHNSON, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301383\nA cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination. HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories. C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries. C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century. C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste. C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Barriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, &#34;WASH&#34;) in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionDesigning policy in public health is a complex process requiring decision making that incorporates available evidence and is suitable to a countrys epidemiological and health system context. The main objective of this study was to develop an options assessment toolkit (OAT) to provide a pragmatic and evidence-based approach to the development of policies for the radical cure (prevention of relapse) of vivax malaria for national malaria control programs in the Asia-Pacific region.

Materials and methodsThe OAT was developed using participatory research methods and a Delphi process using a sequential multi-phase design, adapted with a pre-development phase, a development phase, and a final development phase. In the pre-development phase, a literature review was conducted to inform the toolkit development. Data collection in the development phase consisted of core research team discussions, multiple rounds of consultation with participants from National Malaria Control Programs (NMP) (online and in person), and two separate modified e-Delphi processes with experts. The final development phase was the piloting of the toolkit during the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) Vivax Working Group.

ResultsWe developed a tool kit containing the following elements: i) Baseline Assessment Tool (BAT) to assess the readiness of NMPs for new or improved coverage of radical cure, ii) eight scenarios representative of Asia Pacific region, iii) matching test and treat options based on available options for G6PD testing and radical cure for the given scenarios, iv) an approaches tool to allow NMPs to visualize considerations for policy change process and different implementation strategies/approaches for each test and treat option.

ConclusionsThe OAT can support vivax radical cure policy formulation among NMPs and stakeholders tailoring for their unique country context. Future studies are needed to assess the utility and practicality of using the OAT for specific country context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause  allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination.

HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories.
C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global  caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries.
C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century.
C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste.
C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism.
