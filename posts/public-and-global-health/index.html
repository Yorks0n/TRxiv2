Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance.">

Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.\nMolecular Epidemiology of Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Kalule, J. B.; Bester, L. A.; Banda, D. L.; Derra, F. A.; Chikuse, F.; Tessema, S. K.; Africa PGI Foodborne Diseases Genomic Surveillance Focus Group, ; Foster-Nyarko, E.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296874\nIntroduction: Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent. Methods: The review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. Results: The reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce. Conclusion: Despite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on non-communicable disease patients in sub-Saharan African countries: systematic review\nAuthors: Basa, M. B.; De Vries, J.; McDonagh, D.; Comiskey, C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296938\nAbstract Background COVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries. Method This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations. Findings This review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems. Conclusion This systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use. The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting. All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.

O.; Carnapete, L.; Haider, S. S.; Hanif, S.; Clech, L.; Ridde, V.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296847\nObjective: We reviewed the evidence regarding the health sector reforms implemented in Bangladesh within the past 30 years to understand their impact on the health system and healthcare outcomes. Method: We completed a scoping review of the most recent and relevant publications on health system reforms in Bangladesh from 1990 through 2023. Studies were included if they identified health sector reforms implemented in the last 30 years in Bangladesh, if they focused on health sector reforms impacting health system dimensions, if they were published between 1991 and 2023 in English or French and were full-text peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, book chapters, grey literature, or reports. Results: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary health sector reform shifted from a project-based approach to financing the health sector to a sector-wide approach. Studies found that implementing reform initiatives such as expanding community clinics and a voucher scheme improved healthcare access, especially for rural districts. Despite government efforts, there is a significant shortage of formally qualified health professionals, especially nurses and technologists, low public financing, a relatively high percentage of out-of-pocket payments, and significant barriers to healthcare access. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that health sector reforms implemented within the last 30 years had a limited impact on health systems. More emphasis should be placed on addressing critical issues such as human resources management and health financing, which may contribute to capacity building to cope with emerging threats, such as climate change.\nAbsence of Care Among Community-Living Older Persons with Dementia and Functional Limitations: A Cross-National Analysis of Population Survey from 22 Countries\nAuthors: Lin, Z.; Qian, Y.; Gill, T. M.; Hou, X.; Chen, S.; Chen, X.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296622\nBackgroundThe provision of long-term care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) who have functional limitations is a significant global public health challenge. However, there is limited evidence on the patterns of care received by PLWD across countries and regions. This study aimed to examine the global trends in the absence of care for PLWD with functional limitations and identify potential sociodemographic disparities. MethodsWe used harmonized longitudinal survey data from four Health and Retirement Global Family of Studies that surveyed community-living persons aged 50 and older in the United States, England, 18 European countries and Israel, and China. The analysis focused on persons who reported functional limitations and developed dementia during the study periods (2012-2018). Functional limitations were assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Absence of care was evaluated as the proportion of PLWD receiving no care for their ADL/IADL limitations. ResultsAt least 20% of PLWD in both developed and developing countries received no care for their functional limitations, and this absence of care remained stable over time. The absence of care was notable for both ADL and IADL limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Moreover, substantial disparities were observed, with less-educated individuals and those living alone experiencing greater absence of formal and informal care, respectively. These patterns and trends were consistent across all countries and regions studied. Discussion and ImplicationsThe findings underscore the pressing need to ensure basic care provision for persons with dementia and functional limitations, especially for those who are less educated or living alone. Policymakers should prioritize addressing these disparities and improving care provision for this population worldwide.\nDrivers of inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia: A systematic review of qualitative literature\nAuthors: Murray, J. L.; Leung, D. T.; Hanson, O. R.; Ahmed, S. M.; Pavia, A. T.; Khan, A. I.; Szymczak, J. E.; Vaughn, V. M.; Patel, P. K.; Biswas, D.; Watt, M. H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296313\nAntimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires an understanding of the factors and context that contribute to inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The goal of this qualitative systematic review was to synthesize themes across levels of the social ecological framework that drive inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia. In September 2023, we conducted a systematic search using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase. Search terms, identified a priori, were related to research methods, topic, and geographic location. We identified 165 articles from the initial search and 8 upon reference review (n=173); after removing duplicates and preprints (n=12) and excluding those that did not meet eligibility criteria (n=115), 46 articles were included in the review. We assessed methodological quality using the qualitative Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. The studies represented 6 countries in South Asia, and included data from patients, health care providers, community members, and policy makers. For each manuscript, we wrote a summary memo to extract the factors that impede antimicrobial stewardship. We coded memos using NVivo software; codes were organized by levels of the social ecological framework. Barriers were identified at multiple levels including the patient (self-treatment with antimicrobials; perceived value of antimicrobials), the provider (antimicrobials as a universal therapy; gaps in knowledge and skills; financial or reputational incentives), the clinical setting (lack of resources; poor regulation of the facility), the community (access to formal health care; informal drug vendors; social norms), and policy (absence of a regulatory framework; poor implementation of existing policies). The findings highlight the importance of working across multiple sectors to design and implement approaches to antimicrobial stewardship in South Asia.\nAssessing health equity in wastewater monitoring programs: Differences in the demographics and social vulnerability of sewered and unsewered populations across North Carolina\nAuthors: Hu, X. C.; Reckling, S. K.; Keshaviah, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296680\nBackgroundWastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied. ObjectivesWe conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county. MethodsAfter intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system--regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring--with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than +/-5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error). ResultsAs a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents. DiscussionOur results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent. Methods: The review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. Results: The reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce. Conclusion: Despite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abstract Background COVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region.  This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries. Method This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations. Findings This review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems. Conclusion This systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use. The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting.  All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.

        <p class="abstract">Objective: We reviewed the evidence regarding the health sector reforms implemented in Bangladesh within the past 30 years to understand their impact on the health system and healthcare outcomes. Method: We completed a scoping review of the most recent and relevant publications on health system reforms in Bangladesh from 1990 through 2023. Studies were included if they identified health sector reforms implemented in the last 30 years in Bangladesh, if they focused on health sector reforms impacting health system dimensions, if they were published between 1991 and 2023 in English or French and were full-text peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, book chapters, grey literature, or reports. Results: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary health sector reform shifted from a project-based approach to financing the health sector to a sector-wide approach. Studies found that implementing reform initiatives such as expanding community clinics and a voucher scheme improved healthcare access, especially for rural districts. Despite government efforts, there is a significant shortage of formally qualified health professionals, especially nurses and technologists, low public financing, a relatively high percentage of out-of-pocket payments, and significant barriers to healthcare access. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that health sector reforms implemented within the last 30 years had a limited impact on health systems. More emphasis should be placed on addressing critical issues such as human resources management and health financing, which may contribute to capacity building to cope with emerging threats, such as climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe provision of long-term care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) who have functional limitations is a significant global public health challenge. However, there is limited evidence on the patterns of care received by PLWD across countries and regions. This study aimed to examine the global trends in the absence of care for PLWD with functional limitations and identify potential sociodemographic disparities.

MethodsWe used harmonized longitudinal survey data from four Health and Retirement Global Family of Studies that surveyed community-living persons aged 50 and older in the United States, England, 18 European countries and Israel, and China. The analysis focused on persons who reported functional limitations and developed dementia during the study periods (2012-2018). Functional limitations were assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Absence of care was evaluated as the proportion of PLWD receiving no care for their ADL/IADL limitations.

ResultsAt least 20% of PLWD in both developed and developing countries received no care for their functional limitations, and this absence of care remained stable over time. The absence of care was notable for both ADL and IADL limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Moreover, substantial disparities were observed, with less-educated individuals and those living alone experiencing greater absence of formal and informal care, respectively. These patterns and trends were consistent across all countries and regions studied.

Discussion and ImplicationsThe findings underscore the pressing need to ensure basic care provision for persons with dementia and functional limitations, especially for those who are less educated or living alone. Policymakers should prioritize addressing these disparities and improving care provision for this population worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires an understanding of the factors and context that contribute to inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The goal of this qualitative systematic review was to synthesize themes across levels of the social ecological framework that drive inappropriate use of antimicrobials in South Asia. In September 2023, we conducted a systematic search using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase. Search terms, identified a priori, were related to research methods, topic, and geographic location. We identified 165 articles from the initial search and 8 upon reference review (n=173); after removing duplicates and preprints (n=12) and excluding those that did not meet eligibility criteria (n=115), 46 articles were included in the review. We assessed methodological quality using the qualitative Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. The studies represented 6 countries in South Asia, and included data from patients, health care providers, community members, and policy makers. For each manuscript, we wrote a summary memo to extract the factors that impede antimicrobial stewardship. We coded memos using NVivo software; codes were organized by levels of the social ecological framework. Barriers were identified at multiple levels including the patient (self-treatment with antimicrobials; perceived value of antimicrobials), the provider (antimicrobials as a universal therapy; gaps in knowledge and skills; financial or reputational incentives), the clinical setting (lack of resources; poor regulation of the facility), the community (access to formal health care; informal drug vendors; social norms), and policy (absence of a regulatory framework; poor implementation of existing policies). The findings highlight the importance of working across multiple sectors to design and implement approaches to antimicrobial stewardship in South Asia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWastewater monitoring is a valuable tool to track community-level disease trends. However, the extent to which vulnerable populations have been included in statewide wastewater monitoring programs remains unstudied.

ObjectivesWe conducted a geospatial analysis to examine (1) the representativeness of wastewater data collected through the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network as of June 2022, and (2) the potential of wastewater data to generalize to unsewered populations in the county.

MethodsAfter intersecting wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) service areas (sewersheds) with census block and tract boundaries for 38 WWTPs across 18 counties, we compared the demographics and social vulnerability of (1) people residing in sewersheds of monitored WWTPs with countywide and statewide populations, and (2) people connected to any sewer system--regardless of inclusion in wastewater monitoring--with unsewered populations. We flagged differences greater than &#43;/-5 percentage points or percent (for categorical and continuous variables, respectively) and noted which were statistically significant (i.e., greater than twice the margin of error).

ResultsAs a whole, populations in monitored sewersheds resembled the statewide population on most demographics analyzed, with a few exceptions. When multiple WWTPs were monitored within a county, their combined service populations resembled the countywide population, although populations in individually monitored sewersheds sometimes differed from the countywide population. In nine counties for which we had comprehensive sewershed maps, we found that sewered residents had higher social vulnerability, a greater share of Hispanics and African Americans, lower income, and lower educational attainment than unsewered residents.

DiscussionOur results suggest that wastewater monitoring in North Carolina well represents the larger community. Ongoing analyses will be needed as sites are added or removed. The approach we present here can be used to ensure that wastewater surveillance programs nationwide are implemented in a manner that informs equitable public health decision-making.</p>
