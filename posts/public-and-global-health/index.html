MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S.

A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; Hurt, B.; Chen,\nScore: 98.8, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nGeographic accessibility to public healthcare facilities and spatial clustering during the wet and dry seasons in Cote d'Ivoire\nAuthors: Sehi, G. T.; Houngbedji, C. A.; Parker, D. M.; Macharia, P. M.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298865\nIntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations. MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([\u0026ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices. ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons. ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access. Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare. C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility. C_LI What this study addsO_LIIn the dry season, the mean travel time to the nearest healthcare facility at the national level is approximately 1.8 hours, whereas in the wet season, it increases to 3.4 hours. C_LIO_LIOver 80% of the population can reach a healthcare facility within 2 hours during the dry season, but only 66% can do so during the wet season. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policy.O_LIPolicymakers can use this study to develop policies that address seasonal variations in accessibility, ensuring that healthcare services remain accessible even during adverse weather conditions.

ObjectivesThis study aims to identify Long Covid clusters and to relate them to the clinical classification devised at the Clinical Research Unit of Brugmann University Hospital, Brussels. MethodA two-stage multidimensional exploratory analysis was performed on a cohort of 205 long Covid patients, involving a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD), and then Hierarchical Clustering Post Component Analysis (HCPC). ResultsThe studys sample comprised 76% women, with an average age of 44.5 years. Three clinical forms were identified: long, persistent, and post-viral syndrome. Multidimensional analysis identified three clusters: cluster 1 (myalgia-like pain) associated with the persistent clinical form; cluster 2 (neurocognitive disorders) linked to the long clinical form; cluster 3 (neurocognitive disorders, anxio-depressive syndrome, joint pain and myalgia, peripheral nervous system disorders with dysautonomia, including Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, along with digestive system disorders). However, biological data did not provide sufficient differentiation between the clusters. ConclusionLong Covid phenotypes, as well as clinical forms, appear to be associated with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms or genetic predisposition, warranting further investigation.\nImproving SARS-CoV-2 variants monitoring in the absence of genomic surveillance capabilities: a serological study in Bolivian blood donors in October 2021 and June 2022\nAuthors: Inchauste, L.; Nurtop, E.; Bautista Machicado, L.; Leigue Roth, Y.; Lenz Gonzales, S.; Herrera, M. L.; Mina Villafan, K.; Mamani Mamani, P.; Ramos Espinoza, M.; Pavel Suarez, J. C.; Garcia Copa, J. C.; Leigue Zabala, Y.; Arancibia Cardozo, E.; Gallian, P.; de Lamballerie, X.; Priet, S.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298957\nUnlike genomic data, serological data have not been previously leveraged to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulation. In Bolivia, sustained genomic surveillance capacities were lacking especially at the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021 and 2022 we estimated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Bolivian blood donors and explored the feasibility of using virus serum neutralization data for variants thought to have circulated to map their circulation across all departments over a year-long follow-up period. Anti-S1 and anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were studied, along with virus neutralization tests for ancestral-D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Between 2021 and 2022, the overall prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies increased reaching values over 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naive to the virus. Viral neutralization data, analyzed through multiple approaches, revealed the spread of the Gamma variant up to 2021, particularly impacting northern departments. In 2022, Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments of the country and the emergence of Omicron BA.1 was detected. These trends align with publicly available genomic data from neighboring countries. Our serological analyses successfully identified both new antigenic groups, such as Omicron BA.1, and individual variants related to previously circulating groups, such as Delta. The study contributes insights into overall population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variant-specific immunity levels across different regions of Bolivia. It also emphasizes the potency of seroprevalence studies in informing public health decisions and underscore their value in capturing the initial phases of emerging epidemics when variant diversity is limited, facilitating timely genomic surveillance setup.\nAffect and post-COVID-19 symptoms in daily life: An exploratory experience sampling study\nAuthors: Schaap, G.; Wensink, M.; Doggen, C. J. M.; van der Palen, J.; Vonkeman, H. E.; Bode, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23298760\nInsight into the daily life experiences of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome is lacking. The current study explored temporal fluctuations of and associations between positive and negative affect and symptoms throughout the day in previously hospitalised post-COVID-19 patients using an experience sampling methodology. Ten participants (age: median = 60, interquartile range = 9 years; 50% women ; 80% [\u0026ge;]1 comorbidity; 8-12 months since hospital discharge) filled out brief online questionnaires, six times a day for 14 consecutive days. Positive and negative affect, and self-reported symptoms (physical and mental fatigue, cognitive functioning, dyspnoea, and pain) were assessed in real-time. Primarily, graphs were analysed to assess the individual longitudinal courses of and (concurrent and time-lagged) associations between affect and symptoms. Secondly, correlations or multilevel linear regression models were used to support these interpretations. Visual assessment showed limited temporal fluctuation in affect and symptoms. All symptoms appeared to associate positively with each other (correlations between .26 and .85). Positive affect was associated with lower symptoms severity ({beta}s between -.28 and -.67), and negative affect with higher symptoms severity ({beta}s between .24 and .66). Time-lagged analyses showed that - adjusted for residual symptom severity of prior measurements - both types of affect predicted symptom severity two hours later ({beta}s between -.09 and -.31 for positive affect; between .09 and .28 for negative affect). These findings suggest that positive and negative affect may play important roles in post-COVID-19 symptom experience and temporal fluctuation.\nPan-Enterovirus Characterization Reveals Cryptic Circulation of Clinically Relevant Subtypes in Arizona Wastewater\nAuthors: Erickson, D.

A.; Whealy, R. N.; Barber, J.; Gordon, N. B.; Sahl, J. W.; Pearson, T.; Fofanov, V. Y.; Furstenau, T.; Driebe, E. M.; Caporaso, J. G.; Terriquez, J.; Engelthaler, D. M.; Hep\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.23297677\nBackgroundMost seasonally circulating enteroviruses result in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease. ObjectiveThe overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics. MethodsThis study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July- October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach. ResultsIn the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis revealed just one importation into the state led to local circulation. SignificanceThis study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms. IMPACT STATEMENTMuch of our response to infectious disease threats is reactive, even in the case of seasonally circulating viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been successfully used for mitigation purposes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and has potential to be implemented for other pathogens that can cause severe infections. While vaccines and treatment beyond supportive care are not available for many infections, this method of surveillance can provide situational awareness to public health agencies, medical professionals, and the general population, possibly paving the way for earlier public health response.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized.

MethodsWe included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience.

ResultsThe median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition.

ConclusionsIn this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionGeographic accessibility to healthcare is a key determinant of health outcomes. Yet, globally, over 4.5 billion people lack access to healthcare, majority of which are located in low and middle-income countries. While metrics of spatial access should consider variation in seasonality, studies in Cote dIvoire have overlooked seasonality impacts and how such metrics are spatially clustered. Here, we assessed geographical accessibility to public health care in Cote dIvoire across wet and dry seasons while assessing clustering and identifying marginalized populations.

MethodsWe assembled spatial data on the location of public healthcare facilities, factors that affect travel, population distribution, and healthcare-seeking behaviour. Using these datasets, plausible travel scenarios reflecting seasonality were combined within a cost-distance algorithm in AccessMod (version 5) to model travel time to the nearest facility at 1km resolution for dry and wet seasons. We determined the proportion of the population within 2 hours travel time at the district level. We assessed marginalization ([&amp;ge;]4 hours from the nearest facility) and spatial autocorrelation using Morans I indices.

ResultsAt the national level, mean travel time to the nearest public healthcare facility was 1.8h during the dry season and 3.4h during the wet season. The travel times were heterogeneous and varied between 23min - 6h and 38min - 10h during both seasons. About 73% (7 to 98%) of the population was within 2h of the nearest public healthcare facility in the dry season and 55% (2 - 97%) during the wet season at the district level. Poor access clusters were in the north and better access clusters in the south-central area of the country during both seasons.

ConclusionHealthcare access inequalities in Cote dIvoire persist, with inadequate access clusters in the north and better access in the south-central region. There is a need for seasonal-based targeted interventions to improve access.

Key SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAdequate geographic access to healthcare is crucial for timely diagnosis and life-saving interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries where individuals face physical barriers to accessing essential and routine healthcare.
C_LIO_LIHealthcare access in Cote dIvoire has been examined without considering weather seasonality or spatial clustering, yet these play a critical in healthcare accessibility.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIIn the dry season, the mean travel time to the nearest healthcare facility at the national level is approximately 1.8 hours, whereas in the wet season, it increases to 3.4 hours.
C_LIO_LIOver 80% of the population can reach a healthcare facility within 2 hours during the dry season, but only 66% can do so during the wet season.
C_LI

How this study might affect research, practice or policy.O_LIPolicymakers can use this study to develop policies that address seasonal variations in accessibility, ensuring that healthcare services remain accessible even during adverse weather conditions.

        <p class="abstract">SARS CoV-2 infection presents complications known as long Covid, a multisystemic organ disease which allow multidimensional analysis.

ObjectivesThis study aims to identify Long Covid clusters and to relate them to the clinical classification devised at the Clinical Research Unit of Brugmann University Hospital, Brussels.

MethodA two-stage multidimensional exploratory analysis was performed on a cohort of 205 long Covid patients, involving a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD), and then Hierarchical Clustering Post Component Analysis (HCPC).

ResultsThe studys sample comprised 76% women, with an average age of 44.5 years. Three clinical forms were identified: long, persistent, and post-viral syndrome. Multidimensional analysis identified three clusters: cluster 1 (myalgia-like pain) associated with the persistent clinical form; cluster 2 (neurocognitive disorders) linked to the long clinical form; cluster 3 (neurocognitive disorders, anxio-depressive syndrome, joint pain and myalgia, peripheral nervous system disorders with dysautonomia, including Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, along with digestive system disorders). However, biological data did not provide sufficient differentiation between the clusters.

ConclusionLong Covid phenotypes, as well as clinical forms, appear to be associated with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms or genetic predisposition, warranting further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unlike genomic data, serological data have not been previously leveraged to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulation. In Bolivia, sustained genomic surveillance capacities were lacking especially at the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021 and 2022 we estimated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Bolivian blood donors and explored the feasibility of using virus serum neutralization data for variants thought to have circulated to map their circulation across all departments over a year-long follow-up period. Anti-S1 and anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were studied, along with virus neutralization tests for ancestral-D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Between 2021 and 2022, the overall prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies increased reaching values over 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naive to the virus. Viral neutralization data, analyzed through multiple approaches, revealed the spread of the Gamma variant up to 2021, particularly impacting northern departments. In 2022, Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments of the country and the emergence of Omicron BA.1 was detected. These trends align with publicly available genomic data from neighboring countries. Our serological analyses successfully identified both new antigenic groups, such as Omicron BA.1, and individual variants related to previously circulating groups, such as Delta. The study contributes insights into overall population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variant-specific immunity levels across different regions of Bolivia. It also emphasizes the potency of seroprevalence studies in informing public health decisions and underscore their value in capturing the initial phases of emerging epidemics when variant diversity is limited, facilitating timely genomic surveillance setup.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insight into the daily life experiences of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome is lacking. The current study explored temporal fluctuations of and associations between positive and negative affect and symptoms throughout the day in previously hospitalised post-COVID-19 patients using an experience sampling methodology. Ten participants (age: median = 60, interquartile range = 9 years; 50% women ; 80% [&amp;ge;]1 comorbidity; 8-12 months since hospital discharge) filled out brief online questionnaires, six times a day for 14 consecutive days. Positive and negative affect, and self-reported symptoms (physical and mental fatigue, cognitive functioning, dyspnoea, and pain) were assessed in real-time. Primarily, graphs were analysed to assess the individual longitudinal courses of and (concurrent and time-lagged) associations between affect and symptoms. Secondly, correlations or multilevel linear regression models were used to support these interpretations. Visual assessment showed limited temporal fluctuation in affect and symptoms. All symptoms appeared to associate positively with each other (correlations between .26 and .85). Positive affect was associated with lower symptoms severity ({beta}s between -.28 and -.67), and negative affect with higher symptoms severity ({beta}s between .24 and .66). Time-lagged analyses showed that - adjusted for residual symptom severity of prior measurements - both types of affect predicted symptom severity two hours later ({beta}s between -.09 and -.31 for positive affect; between .09 and .28 for negative affect). These findings suggest that positive and negative affect may play important roles in post-COVID-19 symptom experience and temporal fluctuation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMost seasonally circulating enteroviruses result in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease.

ObjectiveThe overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics.

MethodsThis study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July- October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach.

ResultsIn the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis revealed just one importation into the state led to local circulation.

SignificanceThis study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms.

IMPACT STATEMENTMuch of our response to infectious disease threats is reactive, even in the case of seasonally circulating viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been successfully used for mitigation purposes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and has potential to be implemented for other pathogens that can cause severe infections. While vaccines and treatment beyond supportive care are not available for many infections, this method of surveillance can provide situational awareness to public health agencies, medical professionals, and the general population, possibly paving the way for earlier public health response.</p>
