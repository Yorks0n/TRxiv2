In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nGWAS of cataract in Puerto Ricans identifies a novel large-effect variant in ITGA6\nAuthors: Shi, J.; O'Connell, J.; Hicks, B.; Wang, W.; Bryc, K.; Brady, J. J.; Vacic, V.; Freyman, W.; Abul-Husn, N. S.; Auton, A.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Shringarpure, S. S.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293173\nCataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.\nThe effect of conflict on medical facilities in Mariupol, Ukraine: a quasi-experimental study\nAuthors: Poole, D. N.; Andersen, D.; Raymond, N. A.; Parham, J.; Howarth, C.; Hathaway, O. A.; Khoshnood, K.; Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, Score: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293508\nMedical facilities are civilian objects specially protected by international humanitarian law. Despite the need for systematic documentation of the effects of war on medical facilities for judiciary accountability, current methods for surveilling damage to protected civilian objects during ongoing armed conflict are insufficient. Satellite imagery damage assessment confers significant possibilities for investigating patterns of war. We leveraged commercially and publicly available satellite imagery and geolocated facility data to conduct a pre-post quasi-experimental study of damage to medical infrastructure in Mariupol, Ukraine as a result of Russias invasion. We found that 77% of medical facilities in Mariupol sustained damage during Russias siege lasting from February 24 - May 20, 2022. Facility size was not associated with damage, suggesting that attacks on medical facilities are not a residual of physical infrastructure characteristics. This is the first geographically comprehensive pre-post study of the effects of an ongoing conflict on specially protected medical infrastructure.\nComparative Immunogenicity, Safety and Efficacy Profiles of four COVID-19 Vaccine types in healthy adults: Systematic Review cum Meta-analysis of Clinical Trial data\nAuthors: Yoong, S. Q.; Bhowmik, P.; Dutta, D.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293964\nFour principal types of authorised COVID-19 vaccines include inactivated whole-virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, viral-vector vaccines and nucleic acid (mRNA and DNA) vaccines. Despite numerous Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), comprehensive systematic review and comparative meta-analysis have not been performed to validate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the healthy adult population. We aim to fulfil this unmet void. We searched for peer-reviewed articles about RCTs of the COVID-19 vaccines on healthy adults (18-64 years) available in eight major bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, POPLINE, HINARI) till August 28, 2022. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted by pooling dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (safety outcomes) and continuous outcomes using standardised mean differences (immunogenicity outcomes). Efficacy outcomes were summarised narratively. Moderate to high-quality evidence suggests that those receiving COVID-19 vaccines had significantly higher immune responses compared to placebo. Serious adverse events were rare, confirming that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and immunogenic for the healthy adult population. Remarkably, adverse events were the least common in inactivated vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines were the most immunogenic. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 21.9% to 95.9% in preventing COVID-19. We endorse all four types of COVID-19 vaccines for public health policy implementing taskforces. Yet, meta-analyses based on individual patient data are warranted for more extensive measurement of differential impacts of COVID-19 vaccines on different genders, ethnicities, comorbidities and types of vaccine jabbed.\nLLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) - Plasmodium infection prevalence and genotypic markers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors from 48 districts of Uganda\nAuthors: Lynd, A. R.; Gonahasa, S.; Staedke, S. G.; Oruni, A.; Maiteki-Sebuguzi, C.; Hancock, P. A.; Knight, E.; Dorsey, G.; Opigo, J.; Yeka, A.; Katureebe, A.; Kyohere, M.; Hemingway, J.; Kamya, M. R.; McDermott, D.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293323\nBackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections. ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda. ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

E.; Tuite, A.; Fisman, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.23293449\nBackgroundSurveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk. MethodsSARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary. ResultsTesting rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%. ConclusionsStandardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.\nSensitivity and consistency of long- and short-read metagenomics and epicPCR for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes and their bacterial hosts in wastewater\nAuthors: Lou, E. G.; Fu, Y.; Wang, Q.; Treangen, T.; Stadler, L.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293828\nWastewater surveillance is a powerful tool to assess the risks associated with antibiotic resistance in communities. One challenge is selecting which analytical tool to deploy to measure risk indicators, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their respective bacterial hosts. Although metagenomics is frequently used for analyzing ARGs, few studies have compared the performance of long-read and short-read metagenomics in identifying which bacteria harbor ARGs in wastewater. Furthermore, for ARG host detection, untargeted metagenomics has not been compared to targeted methods such as epicPCR. Here, we 1) evaluated long-read and short-read metagenomics as well as epicPCR for detecting ARG hosts in wastewater, and 2) investigated the host range of ARGs across the WWTP to evaluate host proliferation. Results highlighted long-read revealed a wider range of ARG hosts compared to short-read metagenomics. Nonetheless, the ARG host range detected by long-read metagenomics only represented a subset of the hosts detected by epicPCR. The ARG-host linkages across the influent and effluent of the WWTP were characterized. Results showed the ARG-host phylum linkages were relatively consistent across the WWTP, whereas new ARG-host species linkages appeared in the WWTP effluent. The ARG-host linkages of several clinically relevant species found in the effluent were identified.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.

ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.

ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cataract is a common cause of vision loss and affects millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family studies of cataract have demonstrated a role for genetics in cataract susceptibility. However, most of these studies have been conducted in populations of European or Asian descent, leaving the genetic etiology of cataract among Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations unclear. Here we perform the first GWAS of cataract in a Puerto Rican population of research participants derived from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc. In our analysis with 3,060 self-reported cases and 41,890 controls, we found a novel association of large effect size with a rare coding variant in the ITGA6 gene (rs200560853, p-value=2.9x10-12, OR=12.7, 95% CI=[6.5, 24.7]). ITGA6 is part of the integrin alpha chain in the laminin receptor subfamily, and likely contributes to eye lens homeostasis, transparency, and cell survival. We found that this coding variant is associated with a 13.7 year earlier disease onset on average, as well as a 4.3-fold higher rate of cataract events in the Puerto Rican population. The variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.089% in Puerto Rico and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. Population genetic analyses showed that the variant is only found in individuals with ancestry from the Americas and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting a North African origin. Our discovery identifies a novel genetic risk factor for cataract in Puerto Ricans and highlights the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomics research to improve our understanding of disease in all populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medical facilities are civilian objects specially protected by international humanitarian law. Despite the need for systematic documentation of the effects of war on medical facilities for judiciary accountability, current methods for surveilling damage to protected civilian objects during ongoing armed conflict are insufficient. Satellite imagery damage assessment confers significant possibilities for investigating patterns of war. We leveraged commercially and publicly available satellite imagery and geolocated facility data to conduct a pre-post quasi-experimental study of damage to medical infrastructure in Mariupol, Ukraine as a result of Russias invasion. We found that 77% of medical facilities in Mariupol sustained damage during Russias siege lasting from February 24 - May 20, 2022. Facility size was not associated with damage, suggesting that attacks on medical facilities are not a residual of physical infrastructure characteristics. This is the first geographically comprehensive pre-post study of the effects of an ongoing conflict on specially protected medical infrastructure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Four principal types of authorised COVID-19 vaccines include inactivated whole-virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, viral-vector vaccines and nucleic acid (mRNA and DNA) vaccines. Despite numerous Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), comprehensive systematic review and comparative meta-analysis have not been performed to validate the immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the healthy adult population. We aim to fulfil this unmet void. We searched for peer-reviewed articles about RCTs of the COVID-19 vaccines on healthy adults (18-64 years) available in eight major bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, POPLINE, HINARI) till August 28, 2022. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted by pooling dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (safety outcomes) and continuous outcomes using standardised mean differences (immunogenicity outcomes). Efficacy outcomes were summarised narratively. Moderate to high-quality evidence suggests that those receiving COVID-19 vaccines had significantly higher immune responses compared to placebo. Serious adverse events were rare, confirming that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and immunogenic for the healthy adult population. Remarkably, adverse events were the least common in inactivated vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines were the most immunogenic. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 21.9% to 95.9% in preventing COVID-19. We endorse all four types of COVID-19 vaccines for public health policy implementing taskforces. Yet, meta-analyses based on individual patient data are warranted for more extensive measurement of differential impacts of COVID-19 vaccines on different genders, ethnicities, comorbidities and types of vaccine jabbed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda. In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density. In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years. In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections.

ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households. The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An. gambiae s.s, but not An. funestus. The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types. The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased. Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda.

ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted. The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSurveillance of communicable diseases typically relies on case counts for estimates of risk, and counts can be strongly influenced by testing rates. In the Canadian province of Ontario, testing rates varied markedly by age, sex, geography and time over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We applied a standardization-based approach to test-adjustment to better understand pandemic dynamics from 2020 to 2022, and to better understand when test-adjustment is necessary for accurate estimation of risk.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 case counts by age, sex, public health unit and week were obtained from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system (CCM), which includes all SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Complete data on testing volumes was obtained from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS). Case counts were adjusted for under-testing using a previously published standardization-based approach that estimates case numbers that would have been expected if the entire population was tested at the same rate as most-tested age and sex groups. Logistic regression was used to identify threshold testing rates beyond which test-adjustment was unnecessary.

ResultsTesting rates varied markedly by age, sex, public health unit and pandemic wave. After adjustment for under-testing, overall case counts increased threefold. Adjusted epidemic curves suggested, in contrast to reported case counts, that the first two pandemic waves were equivalent in size, and that there were three distinct pandemic waves in 2022, due to the emergence of Omicron variants. Under-reporting was greatest in children and young males, and varied significantly across public health units, with variation explained partly by testing rates and prevalence of multigenerational households. Test adjustment resulted in little change in the epidemic curve during pandemic waves when testing rates were highest; we found that test-adjustment did not increase case counts once weekly per capita testing rates exceeded 6.3%.

ConclusionsStandardization-based adjustment for differential testing by age and sex, and for dynamic changes in testing over time, results in a different picture of infection risk during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario; test-adjusted epidemic curves are concordant with observed patterns of mortality during the pandemic and have face validity. This methodology offers an alternative to sero-epidemiology for identification of true burden of infection when reinfection, sero-reversion, and non-specificity of serological assays make sero-epidemiology challenging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance is a powerful tool to assess the risks associated with antibiotic resistance in communities. One challenge is selecting which analytical tool to deploy to measure risk indicators, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their respective bacterial hosts. Although metagenomics is frequently used for analyzing ARGs, few studies have compared the performance of long-read and short-read metagenomics in identifying which bacteria harbor ARGs in wastewater. Furthermore, for ARG host detection, untargeted metagenomics has not been compared to targeted methods such as epicPCR. Here, we 1) evaluated long-read and short-read metagenomics as well as epicPCR for detecting ARG hosts in wastewater, and 2) investigated the host range of ARGs across the WWTP to evaluate host proliferation. Results highlighted long-read revealed a wider range of ARG hosts compared to short-read metagenomics. Nonetheless, the ARG host range detected by long-read metagenomics only represented a subset of the hosts detected by epicPCR. The ARG-host linkages across the influent and effluent of the WWTP were characterized. Results showed the ARG-host phylum linkages were relatively consistent across the WWTP, whereas new ARG-host species linkages appeared in the WWTP effluent. The ARG-host linkages of several clinically relevant species found in the effluent were identified.</p>
