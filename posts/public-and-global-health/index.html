In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates. ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P \u003c 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth. ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.\nHigh-Dose Naloxone Formulations Are Not as Essential as We Thought\nAuthors: Lemen, P. M.; Garrett, D. P.; Thompson, E.; Aho, M.; Vasquez, C.; Park, J.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.23293781\nNaloxone is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved opioid antagonist for reversing opioid overdoses. Naloxone is available to the public, and can be administered through intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), and intranasal spray (IN) routes. Our literature review aimed to improve understanding regarding the adequacy of the regularly distributed two doses of low-dose IM or IN naloxone in effectively reversing fentanyl overdoses and whether high-dose naloxone formulations (HDNF) formulations are an optimal solution to this problem. Moreover, our initiative incorporated the perspectives and experiences of people who use drugs (PWUD), enabling a more practical and contextually-grounded analysis. We began by discussing the knowledge and perspectives of Tennessee Harm Reduction, a small peer-led harm reduction organization. A comprehensive literature review was then conducted to gather relevant scholarly works on the subject matter. The evidence indicates that, although higher doses of naloxone have been administered in both clinical and community settings, the vast majority of fentanyl overdoses can be successfully reversed using standard IM dosages with the exception of carfentanil overdoses and other more potent fentanyl analogs, which necessitate three or more doses for effective reversal. Multiple studies documented the risk of precipitated withdrawal using high doses of naloxone. Notably, the possibility of recurring overdose symptoms after resuscitation exists, contingent upon the half-life of the specific opioid. Considering these findings and the current community practice of distributing multiple doses, we recommend providing at least four standard doses of IN or IM naloxone to each potential bystander, and training them to continue administration until the recipient achieves stability, ensuring appropriate intervals between each dose. Based on the evidence, we do not recommend HDNF in the place of providing four doses of standard naloxone due to the higher cost, risk of precipitated withdrawal and limited evidence compared to standard IN and IM. All results must be taken into consideration with the inclusion of the lived experiences, individual requirements, and consent of PWUD as crucial factors. It is imperative to refrain from formulating decisions concerning PWUD in their absence, as their participation and voices should be integral to the decision-making process.\nA Scoping Review of Pacing for Management of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): Lessons Learned for the Long COVID Pandemic\nAuthors: Sanal-Hayes, N.; Mclaughlin, M.; Hayes, L. D. D.; Mair, J.; Ormerod, J.; Carless, D.; Hilliard, N.; Meach, R.; Ingram, J.; Sculthorpe, N.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293935\nBackgroundControversy over treatment for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a barrier to appropriate treatment. Energy management or pacing is a prominent coping strategy for people with ME/CFS that involves regulating activity to avoid post exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after an activity. Until now, characteristics of pacing, and the effects on patients symptoms had not been systematically reviewed. This is problematic as the most common approach to pacing, pacing prescription, and the pooled efficacy of pacing was unknown. Collating evidence may help advise those suffering with similar symptoms, including long COVID, as practitioners would be better informed on methodological approaches to adopt, pacing implementation, and expected outcomes. ObjectivesIn this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type of, and outcomes of, pacing in people with ME/CFS. Eligibility criteriaOriginal investigations concerning pacing were considered in participants with ME/CFS. Sources of evidenceSix electronic databases (PubMed, Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) were searched; and websites MEPedia, Action for ME, and ME Action were also searched for grey literature. MethodsA scoping review was conducted. Review selection and characterisation was performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. ResultsAuthors reviewed 177 titles and abstracts, resulting in included 17 studies: three randomised control trials (RCTs); one uncontrolled trial; one interventional case series; one retrospective observational study; two prospective observational studies; four cross-sectional observational studies; and five cross-sectional analytical studies. Studies included variable designs, durations, and outcome measures. In terms of pacing administration, studies used educational sessions and diaries for activity monitoring. Eleven studies reported benefits of pacing, four studies reported no effect, and two studies reported a detrimental effect in comparison to the control group. ConclusionsHighly variable study designs and outcome measures, allied to poor to fair methodological quality resulted in heterogenous findings and highlights the requirement for more research examining pacing. Looking to the long COVID pandemic, future studies should be RCTs utilising objectively quantified digitised pacing, over a longer duration of examination, using the core outcome set for patient reported outcome measures.\nCOVID-19 among migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons: systematic review, meta-analysis and qualitative synthesis of the global empirical literature\nAuthors: Hintermeier, M.; Gottlieb, N. D.; Rohleder, S.; Oppenberg, J.; Baroudi, M.; Pernitez-Agan, S.; Lopez, J.; Flores, S.; Mohsenpour, A. M.; Wickramage, K.; Bozorgmehr, K.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293586\nBackgroundPandemic response and preparedness plans aim at mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and protecting public health, but migrants are often side-lined. Evidence amounted early that migrants are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. However, synthesised evidence is lacking that quantifies the inequalities in infection risk and disease outcomes, or contextualises the consequences of pandemic measures and their underlying mechanisms. MethodsSystematic review searching 25 databases and grey literature (12/2019 to 11/2021). We considered empirical articles covering migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced persons reporting SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalisation, ICU admission, mortality, COVID-19 vaccination rates or health consequences of pandemic measures. Random-effects meta-analysis of observational studies and qualitative analysis were performed for evidence synthesis. A Protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021296952). FindingsOut of 6956 studies, we included 241 in the review. For the quantitative studies (n=46), meta-analysis with over 40 million study participants showed that compared to non-migrants, migrants have an elevated risk of infection (RR = 2{middle dot}33; 95%-CI: 1{middle dot}88-2{middle dot}89) but similar risk for hospitalisation (RR = 1{middle dot}05; 0{middle dot}80-1{middle dot}37), while the likelihood of ICU admission was higher (RR = 1{middle dot}36; 1{middle dot}04-1{middle dot}78). Among those hospitalised, migrants had a lower risk of mortality (RR = 0{middle dot}47; 0{middle dot}30-0{middle dot}73), while their population-based excess mortality tended to be higher (RR = 1{middle dot}31; 0{middle dot}95-1{middle dot}80). The qualitative synthesis (n=44) highlighted the complex interplay of social and COVID-19-related factors at different levels. This involved increased exposure, risk, and impact of pandemic measures that compromised the health of migrants. InterpretationEven in the advanced stages of the pandemic, migrants faced higher infection risks and disproportionately suffered from the consequences of COVID-19 disease, including deaths. Population-level interventions in future health emergencies must better consider socio-economic, structural and community-level exposures to mitigate risks among migrants and enhance health information systems, to close coverage gaps in migrant groups.

Although tailored on weekly deaths data from the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat), the logic of the method is applicable to any timely data on infra-annual deaths counts, would they be quarterly, monthly, or other. When the method is applied to a time period still to complete, it is in substance a nowcasting technique whose reliability increases as new data become available, provided a correct specification of the model. It is also presented an application to 30 European countries for the years 2022 and 2023, returning a provisional estimate of life expectancy at birth much earlier than from official statistics. These early estimates show that in Europe the process of recovery in life expectancy at birth from the COVID-19 pandemic will be practically completed in 2023, unless unexpected mortality crises will occur in the second half of the year.\nThe social determinants associated with the advanced stage diagnosis of breast cancer in Egypt\nAuthors: Fekry, M. A.; Kassem, L.; Yang, J. C.; Azim, H. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293931\nBackgroundMajority of Egyptian breast cancer (BC) patients present at advanced stages. We examined the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with late presentation of BC. MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented with BC between 2011 and 2020. Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between sociodemographic factors and advanced BC. ResultsThis cohort included 1,953 patients with median age of 52 years. 1,098 (56.2%) patients were diagnosed at early stages, while 855 (43.8%) patients were diagnosed at advanced stages. Univariate logistic regression analyses revealed that several sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with advanced BC, including having negative family history of BC (OR= 0.1.27; 95% CI:1.05 - 1.54), having no job (OR= 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.53), being married (OR=1.27; 95% CI:1.02 - 1.57), rural residence (OR=1.27; 95% CI:1.02 - 1.57), having more than three children (OR=1.42; 95% CI:1.15 - 1.75), higher KI-67% score (OR=1.01; 95% CI:1.00 - 1.01), having HER2-Enriched or TNBC subtypes (OR= 1.44; 95% CI:1.16 - 1.79), and having tumor grate II/III (OR=4.12; 95% CI:1.58 - 10.77 \u0026 OR= 1.44; 95% CI:1.16 - 1.79, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression model, only KI-67% (aOR=1.01; 95% CI:1.00 - 1.02), having no job (aOR=1.44; 95% CI:1.10 - 1.90), and rural residence (aOR=1.88; 95% CI:1.03 - 3.42) were significantly associated with advanced BC. ConclusionThis study concluded that having no job and rural residence are highly associated with advanced BC. Raising the public awareness is the best strategy to encourage early detection of BC.\nExperiences of psycho-oncological counselling to support mental health in South Australians diagnosed with cancer\nAuthors: Blunt, J.; Trigg, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.23293728\nBackgroundEffective delivery of psycho-oncological support requires understanding of client perceptions of counselling service effectiveness, psychosocial outcomes, and meeting of client support needs and expectations. ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe perceptions of clients accessing psycho-oncological counselling for people directly or indirectly affected by cancer, and describe perceived psychological distress, depression, and anxiety from pre-to post-counselling. MethodsSouth Australian psycho-oncological counselling service clients were recruited (n=28). Psychological distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed before and after counselling sessions. Client expectations, experiences, and counselling outcomes were examined via pre-post-tests, and thematic analysis. ResultsClients reported reduced anxiety (t=-2.31, p=.029), depression (t=-2.51, p=.018), distress (t=-4.19, p\u003c.0001), and global mental health symptomology (t=-2.79, p=.009). Four themes were identified: having no expectations, needing help managing emotions, seeking coping strategies, and seeking better understanding of their experience. Client expectations were satisfied (92.8%), regardless of counselling reason. ConclusionBenefits of counselling included reduced symptomology, receipt of knowledge and skills, and increased ability to manage everyday life. Supportive counselling significantly reduces distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression while supporting client and family functioning during cancer treatment. ImplicationsIndividual supportive counselling plays an integral role in lives of cancer patients and family members. Clients face concerns relating to cancer prognosis (e.g., recurrence fear), and to broader related experiences (e.g., social dynamics). Complex needs across cancer experience as a patient, carer, or other family member, requires that psycho-oncological counselling targets major client expectations, promotes benefits of counselling, and strategies for managing daily life events.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUse of masks and respirators for prevention of respiratory infectious disease transmission is not new, but has proven controversial, and even politically polarizing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the Canadian province of Ontario, mask mandates were introduced by the 34 regional health authorities in an irregular fashion from June to September 2020, creating a quasi-experiment that can be used to evaluate impact of community mask mandates. Ontario SARS-CoV-2 case counts were strongly biased by testing focussed on long-term care facilities and healthcare workers. We developed a simple regression-based test-adjustment method that allowed us to adjust cases for undertesting by age and gender. We used this test- adjusted time series to evaluate mask mandate effectiveness.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of masking using count-based regression models that allowed adjustment for age, sex, public health region and time trends with either reported (unadjusted) cases, or testing-adjusted case counts, as dependent variables. Mask mandates were assumed to take effect in the week after their introduction. Model based estimates of effectiveness were used to estimate the fraction of SARS- CoV-2 cases, severe outcomes, and costs, averted by mask mandates.

ResultsModels that used unadjusted cases as dependent variable identified protective effects of masking (effectiveness 15-42%), though effectiveness was variably statistically significant, depending on model choice. Mask effectiveness in models predicting test-adjusted case counts was substantially higher, ranging from 49% (44- 53%) to 73% (48-86%) depending on model choice. Effectiveness was greater in women than men (P = 0.016), and in urban health units as compared to rural units (P &lt; 0.001). The prevented fraction associated with mask mandates was 46% (41-51%), averting approximately 290,000 clinical cases, averting 3008 deaths and loss of 29,038 QALY. Costs averted represented $CDN 610 million in economic wealth.

ConclusionsLack of adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 undertesting in younger individuals and males generated biased estimates of infection risk and obscures the impact of public health preventive measures. After adjustment for under-testing, the effectiveness of mask mandates emerges as substantial, and robust regardless of model choice. Mask mandates saved substantial numbers of lives, and prevented economic costs, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Naloxone is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved opioid antagonist for reversing opioid overdoses. Naloxone is available to the public, and can be administered through intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), and intranasal spray (IN) routes. Our literature review aimed to improve understanding regarding the adequacy of the regularly distributed two doses of low-dose IM or IN naloxone in effectively reversing fentanyl overdoses and whether high-dose naloxone formulations (HDNF) formulations are an optimal solution to this problem. Moreover, our initiative incorporated the perspectives and experiences of people who use drugs (PWUD), enabling a more practical and contextually-grounded analysis. We began by discussing the knowledge and perspectives of Tennessee Harm Reduction, a small peer-led harm reduction organization. A comprehensive literature review was then conducted to gather relevant scholarly works on the subject matter. The evidence indicates that, although higher doses of naloxone have been administered in both clinical and community settings, the vast majority of fentanyl overdoses can be successfully reversed using standard IM dosages with the exception of carfentanil overdoses and other more potent fentanyl analogs, which necessitate three or more doses for effective reversal. Multiple studies documented the risk of precipitated withdrawal using high doses of naloxone. Notably, the possibility of recurring overdose symptoms after resuscitation exists, contingent upon the half-life of the specific opioid. Considering these findings and the current community practice of distributing multiple doses, we recommend providing at least four standard doses of IN or IM naloxone to each potential bystander, and training them to continue administration until the recipient achieves stability, ensuring appropriate intervals between each dose. Based on the evidence, we do not recommend HDNF in the place of providing four doses of standard naloxone due to the higher cost, risk of precipitated withdrawal and limited evidence compared to standard IN and IM. All results must be taken into consideration with the inclusion of the lived experiences, individual requirements, and consent of PWUD as crucial factors. It is imperative to refrain from formulating decisions concerning PWUD in their absence, as their participation and voices should be integral to the decision-making process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundControversy over treatment for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a barrier to appropriate treatment. Energy management or pacing is a prominent coping strategy for people with ME/CFS that involves regulating activity to avoid post exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after an activity. Until now, characteristics of pacing, and the effects on patients symptoms had not been systematically reviewed. This is problematic as the most common approach to pacing, pacing prescription, and the pooled efficacy of pacing was unknown. Collating evidence may help advise those suffering with similar symptoms, including long COVID, as practitioners would be better informed on methodological approaches to adopt, pacing implementation, and expected outcomes.

ObjectivesIn this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type of, and outcomes of, pacing in people with ME/CFS.

Eligibility criteriaOriginal investigations concerning pacing were considered in participants with ME/CFS.

Sources of evidenceSix electronic databases (PubMed, Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) were searched; and websites MEPedia, Action for ME, and ME Action were also searched for grey literature.

MethodsA scoping review was conducted. Review selection and characterisation was performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms.

ResultsAuthors reviewed 177 titles and abstracts, resulting in included 17 studies: three randomised control trials (RCTs); one uncontrolled trial; one interventional case series; one retrospective observational study; two prospective observational studies; four cross-sectional observational studies; and five cross-sectional analytical studies. Studies included variable designs, durations, and outcome measures. In terms of pacing administration, studies used educational sessions and diaries for activity monitoring. Eleven studies reported benefits of pacing, four studies reported no effect, and two studies reported a detrimental effect in comparison to the control group.

ConclusionsHighly variable study designs and outcome measures, allied to poor to fair methodological quality resulted in heterogenous findings and highlights the requirement for more research examining pacing. Looking to the long COVID pandemic, future studies should be RCTs utilising objectively quantified digitised pacing, over a longer duration of examination, using the core outcome set for patient reported outcome measures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPandemic response and preparedness plans aim at mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and protecting public health, but migrants are often side-lined. Evidence amounted early that migrants are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. However, synthesised evidence is lacking that quantifies the inequalities in infection risk and disease outcomes, or contextualises the consequences of pandemic measures and their underlying mechanisms.

MethodsSystematic review searching 25 databases and grey literature (12/2019 to 11/2021). We considered empirical articles covering migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced persons reporting SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalisation, ICU admission, mortality, COVID-19 vaccination rates or health consequences of pandemic measures. Random-effects meta-analysis of observational studies and qualitative analysis were performed for evidence synthesis. A Protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021296952).

FindingsOut of 6956 studies, we included 241 in the review. For the quantitative studies (n=46), meta-analysis with over 40 million study participants showed that compared to non-migrants, migrants have an elevated risk of infection (RR = 2{middle dot}33; 95%-CI: 1{middle dot}88-2{middle dot}89) but similar risk for hospitalisation (RR = 1{middle dot}05; 0{middle dot}80-1{middle dot}37), while the likelihood of ICU admission was higher (RR = 1{middle dot}36; 1{middle dot}04-1{middle dot}78). Among those hospitalised, migrants had a lower risk of mortality (RR = 0{middle dot}47; 0{middle dot}30-0{middle dot}73), while their population-based excess mortality tended to be higher (RR = 1{middle dot}31; 0{middle dot}95-1{middle dot}80). The qualitative synthesis (n=44) highlighted the complex interplay of social and COVID-19-related factors at different levels. This involved increased exposure, risk, and impact of pandemic measures that compromised the health of migrants.

InterpretationEven in the advanced stages of the pandemic, migrants faced higher infection risks and disproportionately suffered from the consequences of COVID-19 disease, including deaths. Population-level interventions in future health emergencies must better consider socio-economic, structural and community-level exposures to mitigate risks among migrants and enhance health information systems, to close coverage gaps in migrant groups.

        <p class="abstract">This paper proposes a simple method to obtain early estimates of life expectancy at any age using data on weekly deaths. Although tailored on weekly deaths data from the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat), the logic of the method is applicable to any timely data on infra-annual deaths counts, would they be quarterly, monthly, or other. When the method is applied to a time period still to complete, it is in substance a nowcasting technique whose reliability increases as new data become available, provided a correct specification of the model. It is also presented an application to 30 European countries for the years 2022 and 2023, returning a provisional estimate of life expectancy at birth much earlier than from official statistics. These early estimates show that in Europe the process of recovery in life expectancy at birth from the COVID-19 pandemic will be practically completed in 2023, unless unexpected mortality crises will occur in the second half of the year.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajority of Egyptian breast cancer (BC) patients present at advanced stages. We examined the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with late presentation of BC.

MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented with BC between 2011 and 2020. Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between sociodemographic factors and advanced BC.

ResultsThis cohort included 1,953 patients with median age of 52 years. 1,098 (56.2%) patients were diagnosed at early stages, while 855 (43.8%) patients were diagnosed at advanced stages. Univariate logistic regression analyses revealed that several sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with advanced BC, including having negative family history of BC (OR= 0.1.27; 95% CI:1.05 - 1.54), having no job (OR= 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.53), being married (OR=1.27; 95% CI:1.02 - 1.57), rural residence (OR=1.27; 95% CI:1.02 - 1.57), having more than three children (OR=1.42; 95% CI:1.15 - 1.75), higher KI-67% score (OR=1.01; 95% CI:1.00 - 1.01), having HER2-Enriched or TNBC subtypes (OR= 1.44; 95% CI:1.16 - 1.79), and having tumor grate II/III (OR=4.12; 95% CI:1.58 - 10.77 &amp; OR= 1.44; 95% CI:1.16 - 1.79, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression model, only KI-67% (aOR=1.01; 95% CI:1.00 - 1.02), having no job (aOR=1.44; 95% CI:1.10 - 1.90), and rural residence (aOR=1.88; 95% CI:1.03 - 3.42) were significantly associated with advanced BC.

ConclusionThis study concluded that having no job and rural residence are highly associated with advanced BC. Raising the public awareness is the best strategy to encourage early detection of BC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEffective delivery of psycho-oncological support requires understanding of client perceptions of counselling service effectiveness, psychosocial outcomes, and meeting of client support needs and expectations.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe perceptions of clients accessing psycho-oncological counselling for people directly or indirectly affected by cancer, and describe perceived psychological distress, depression, and anxiety from pre-to post-counselling.

MethodsSouth Australian psycho-oncological counselling service clients were recruited (n=28). Psychological distress, anxiety, and depression were assessed before and after counselling sessions. Client expectations, experiences, and counselling outcomes were examined via pre-post-tests, and thematic analysis.

ResultsClients reported reduced anxiety (t=-2.31, p=.029), depression (t=-2.51, p=.018), distress (t=-4.19, p&lt;.0001), and global mental health symptomology (t=-2.79, p=.009). Four themes were identified: having no expectations, needing help managing emotions, seeking coping strategies, and seeking better understanding of their experience. Client expectations were satisfied (92.8%), regardless of counselling reason.

ConclusionBenefits of counselling included reduced symptomology, receipt of knowledge and skills, and increased ability to manage everyday life. Supportive counselling significantly reduces distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression while supporting client and family functioning during cancer treatment.

ImplicationsIndividual supportive counselling plays an integral role in lives of cancer patients and family members. Clients face concerns relating to cancer prognosis (e.g., recurrence fear), and to broader related experiences (e.g., social dynamics). Complex needs across cancer experience as a patient, carer, or other family member, requires that psycho-oncological counselling targets major client expectations, promotes benefits of counselling, and strategies for managing daily life events.</p>
