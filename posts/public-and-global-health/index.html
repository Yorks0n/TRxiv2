We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact. MethodsUsing Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states). ResultsPrevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [\u0026ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [\u0026ge;]3 vaccines vs. \u003c3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%. ConclusionsResults show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.\nBudgeting and advocacy to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene in healthcare facilities: a case study in Nepal\nAuthors: Chettry, L. K.; Bohara, P.; Bohara, R. C.; Jajal, R. H.; Khadha, S.; Subedi, H.; Giri, D.; Sharma, S.; Dhungana, U.; van der Valen, M. T.; Brogan, J.; Anderson, D. M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301941\nBarriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, \"WASH\") in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.\nInvestigating the changing taxonomy and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from door handles in a new infectious disease ward pre- and post-patient admittance\nAuthors: Ackers Johnson, G.; McLaughlin, D.; Doyle, A.; Lewis, J. M.; Neal, T.; Todd, S.; Roberts, A. P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302185\nBackgroundHealthcare associated infections (HAIs) are a significant burden to health systems, with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and increased financial costs. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) further compounds the issue as viable treatment options are constrained. The hospital environment plays a significant role in the development of HAIs, with effective microbial monitoring providing the foundation for targeted interventions and improved infection prevention and control strategies. MethodsThis project sampled door handles in an infectious disease ward at the newly built Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Sampling was performed prior to the first patients being admitted to the ward and then six and twelve months after this date. We also investigated the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of all Staphylococcus spp. identified. ResultsPrior to patient admission, the majority of isolates identified (57%) were Staphylococcus spp., reducing to 32% and 29% at six and twelve months respectively where Bacillus spp. accounted for 51% of isolates. No ESKAPE pathogens were identified. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the Staphylococcus spp. showed the rates of resistance were relatively low for all isolates prior to patient admittance, with the exception of cefoxitin (56%). Overall, resistance was highest after six months of ward use, with only tetracycline showing an increase in resistance at each consecutive time point. Despite an increase in isolates susceptible to all antibiotics after 12 months, the rate of multi-drug resistance remained high. SummaryThis study highlighted the prevalence of a resistant reservoir of bacteria recoverable on high touch surfaces, emphasising the importance of extensive cleaning protocols and efficient, ongoing, environmental surveillance.\nMetatranscriptomic analysis of wastewater sites reveals a high abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes from hospital wastewater.\nAuthors: Musundi, S.; Ng'ang'a, S.; Wanjiru, E. W.; Sagoe, K.; Wandera, E.; Kanoi, B.; Gitaka, J.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302270\nObjectiveThis study analyzed the metatranscriptome of wastewater samples from different sites with a focus of identifying antibiotic resistance genes and the bacterial community. MethodsTwenty-four wastewater samples were collected from a hospital, university sewer, and the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The metatranscriptome was sequenced to identify antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community composition. ResultsMetatranscriptome analysis revealed varying abundances of ARG transcripts across different sites, with 84, 27, 14, and 9 ARG transcripts identified in wastewater collected from the hospital, university, influent, and effluent of a WWTP, respectively. Notably, hospital wastewater contained clinically relevant beta-lactam ARGs, including bla-NDM-1 and several blaOXA transcripts. Four core ARGs, against sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and aminoglycosides aph(6)-ld and aph(3)-lb were also identified. The predominant bacterial community comprised of Gammaproteobacteria, with priority pathogens like Neisseria gonorrhea and Helicobacter pylori present in hospital wastewater and WWTP influent. ConclusionThese findings provide insights into the wastewater resistome and how meta-transcriptomic data can be utilized for the surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Overall, our study highlights the utility of wastewater surveillance in understanding and addressing the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and emphasizes the crucial role of proper wastewater management in protecting public and environmental health.\nClimatic drivers of seasonal dynamics for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in Antananarivo, Madagascar, 2011-2021\nAuthors: RANDRIAMBOLAMANANTSOA, T. H.; RAZANAJATOVO, N. H.; RANAIVOSON, H. C.; RANDRIANASOLO, L.; RABARISON, J. H.; RAZAFINMANJATO, H.; RATSIMBAZAFY, A.; RAKOTO, D. A. D.; HERAUD, J.-M.; LACOSTE, V.; Brook, C. E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302203\nIntroductionRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a primary source of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI), the leading cause of death in children under five. Over 99% of RSV-attributed deaths occur in low-income countries, including Madagascar. RSV transmission is linked to climate, driving highly seasonal dynamics. MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify correlates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar from January 2011-December 2021, then fit catalytic models to cumulative age-structured incidence to estimate age-specific force of infection (FOI). We fit a time series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model to the dataset to estimate weekly RSV transmission, then evaluated associations with precipitation, humidity, and temperature using generalized linear models. We used GAMs to quantify interannual trends in climate and assess whether significant deviations in RSV burden occurred in years representing climatic anomalies. ResultsReported RSV infections in Antananarivo were significantly associated with patient ages [\u0026le;]2 years. Highest FOI was estimated in patients [\u0026le;]1 year, with transmission declining to near-zero by age five before rising in older (60+) cohorts. TSIR models estimated a January-February peak in RSV transmission, which was strongly positively associated with precipitation and more weakly with temperature but negatively related to relative humidity. Precipitation, humidity, and temperature all increased across the study period in Antananarivo, while reported RSV infections remained stable. Significant deviations in RSV burden were not associated with clear climate anomalies. ConclusionsStable rates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo across the past decade may reflect contrasting impacts of elevated precipitation and increased humidity on transmission. If future climate changes yield more rapidly accelerating precipitation than humidity, this could accelerate RSV burden. Introduction of recently-developed public health interventions to combat RSV in low-income settings like Madagascar is essential to mitigating burden of disease (RSV), in particular any future climate-driven increases in transmission or severity. Key MessagesO_LIWhat is already known on this topic: RSV is an important driver of acute lower respiratory tract infections, which represent the leading cause of mortality in children under five across the globe. RSV demonstrates highly seasonal dynamics, as its transmission is linked to climate. C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds: We quantified correlates of RSV infection and estimated the seasonal transmission rate for RSV from reported patient data in Antananarivo, Madagascar. We found that RSV transmission is primarily concentrated in very young children ([\u0026le;]1 year) in Antananarivo and positively associated with high precipitation and low humidity, which focus most transmission in Madagascars January-February rainy season. C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice, or policy: Our study suggests that RSV burden may intensify with future climate change, particularly higher rainfall. We emphasize the high public health importance of accelerating the introduction of recently-developed mAbs (Monoclonal Antibody) and vaccination interventions to combat RSV to low-income settings like Madagascar.

ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\nCross-disciplinary rapid scoping review of structural racial and caste discrimination associated with population health disparities in the 21st Century\nAuthors: Rasali, D. P.; WOODRUFF, B. M.; ALZYOUD, F. A.; KIEL, D.; SCHAFFZIN, K. T.; OSEI, W. D.; FORD, C. L.; JOHNSON, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301383\nA cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination. HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories. C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries. C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century. C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste. C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism.

S.\nScore: 1342.4, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.23298573\nImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects. ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included. Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (\"SAEs\") and severe adverse events (\"Severe AEs\") as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV. ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]). Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAmong adults who test positive for COVID-19, some develop long COVID (symptoms lasting [&amp;ge;]3 months), and some do not. We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact.

MethodsUsing Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states).

ResultsPrevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [&amp;ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [&amp;ge;]3 vaccines vs. &lt;3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%.

ConclusionsResults show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Barriers to achieving and sustaining access to water, sanitation, hygiene, waste management (collectively, &#34;WASH&#34;) in healthcare facilities include a supportive policy environment and adequate funding. While guidelines exist for assessing needs and making initial infrastructure improvements, there is little guidance on how to develop budgets and policies to sustain WASH services in the long-term. We conducted costing and advocacy activities in Thakurbaba municipality, Nepal, with the aim of developing a budget and operations and maintenance policy for WASH in healthcare facilities in partnership with the municipal government. Our objectives for this study are to (1) describe the process and methods used for costing and advocacy, (2) report the costs to achieve and maintain basic WASH services in the eight healthcare facilities of Thakurbaba municipality, and (3) report the outcomes of advocacy activities and policy development. We applied bottom-up costing to enumerate the resources necessary to achieve and maintain basic WASH services and their costs. The annual costs of WASH services ranged from USD 4,881 to 9,527 (including operations and maintenance and annualized capital investments). Cost findings were used to prepare annual budgets recommended to achieve and maintain basic access, which were presented to municipal government and incorporated into an operations and maintenance policy. To-date, the municipality has adopted the policy and established a recovery fund of USD 3,831 for repair and maintenance of infrastructure, and an additional USD 192 per facility for discretionary WASH spending. Advocacy at the national level for WASH in healthcare facilities is currently being championed by the municipality, and findings from this project are being used to inform development of a nationally costed plan for universal access. This study is intended to provide a roadmap for how cost data can be collected and applied to inform policy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHealthcare associated infections (HAIs) are a significant burden to health systems, with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and increased financial costs. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) further compounds the issue as viable treatment options are constrained. The hospital environment plays a significant role in the development of HAIs, with effective microbial monitoring providing the foundation for targeted interventions and improved infection prevention and control strategies.

MethodsThis project sampled door handles in an infectious disease ward at the newly built Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Sampling was performed prior to the first patients being admitted to the ward and then six and twelve months after this date. We also investigated the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of all Staphylococcus spp. identified.

ResultsPrior to patient admission, the majority of isolates identified (57%) were Staphylococcus spp., reducing to 32% and 29% at six and twelve months respectively where Bacillus spp. accounted for 51% of isolates. No ESKAPE pathogens were identified. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the Staphylococcus spp. showed the rates of resistance were relatively low for all isolates prior to patient admittance, with the exception of cefoxitin (56%). Overall, resistance was highest after six months of ward use, with only tetracycline showing an increase in resistance at each consecutive time point. Despite an increase in isolates susceptible to all antibiotics after 12 months, the rate of multi-drug resistance remained high.

SummaryThis study highlighted the prevalence of a resistant reservoir of bacteria recoverable on high touch surfaces, emphasising the importance of extensive cleaning protocols and efficient, ongoing, environmental surveillance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis study analyzed the metatranscriptome of wastewater samples from different sites with a focus of identifying antibiotic resistance genes and the bacterial community.

MethodsTwenty-four wastewater samples were collected from a hospital, university sewer, and the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The metatranscriptome was sequenced to identify antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community composition.

ResultsMetatranscriptome analysis revealed varying abundances of ARG transcripts across different sites, with 84, 27, 14, and 9 ARG transcripts identified in wastewater collected from the hospital, university, influent, and effluent of a WWTP, respectively. Notably, hospital wastewater contained clinically relevant beta-lactam ARGs, including bla-NDM-1 and several blaOXA transcripts. Four core ARGs, against sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and aminoglycosides aph(6)-ld and aph(3)-lb were also identified. The predominant bacterial community comprised of Gammaproteobacteria, with priority pathogens like Neisseria gonorrhea and Helicobacter pylori present in hospital wastewater and WWTP influent.

ConclusionThese findings provide insights into the wastewater resistome and how meta-transcriptomic data can be utilized for the surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Overall, our study highlights the utility of wastewater surveillance in understanding and addressing the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and emphasizes the crucial role of proper wastewater management in protecting public and environmental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a primary source of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI), the leading cause of death in children under five. Over 99% of RSV-attributed deaths occur in low-income countries, including Madagascar. RSV transmission is linked to climate, driving highly seasonal dynamics.

MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify correlates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar from January 2011-December 2021, then fit catalytic models to cumulative age-structured incidence to estimate age-specific force of infection (FOI). We fit a time series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model to the dataset to estimate weekly RSV transmission, then evaluated associations with precipitation, humidity, and temperature using generalized linear models. We used GAMs to quantify interannual trends in climate and assess whether significant deviations in RSV burden occurred in years representing climatic anomalies.

ResultsReported RSV infections in Antananarivo were significantly associated with patient ages [&amp;le;]2 years. Highest FOI was estimated in patients [&amp;le;]1 year, with transmission declining to near-zero by age five before rising in older (60&#43;) cohorts. TSIR models estimated a January-February peak in RSV transmission, which was strongly positively associated with precipitation and more weakly with temperature but negatively related to relative humidity. Precipitation, humidity, and temperature all increased across the study period in Antananarivo, while reported RSV infections remained stable. Significant deviations in RSV burden were not associated with clear climate anomalies.

ConclusionsStable rates of reported RSV infections in Antananarivo across the past decade may reflect contrasting impacts of elevated precipitation and increased humidity on transmission. If future climate changes yield more rapidly accelerating precipitation than humidity, this could accelerate RSV burden. Introduction of recently-developed public health interventions to combat RSV in low-income settings like Madagascar is essential to mitigating burden of disease (RSV), in particular any future climate-driven increases in transmission or severity.

Key MessagesO_LIWhat is already known on this topic: RSV is an important driver of acute lower respiratory tract infections, which represent the leading cause of mortality in children under five across the globe. RSV demonstrates highly seasonal dynamics, as its transmission is linked to climate.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds: We quantified correlates of RSV infection and estimated the seasonal transmission rate for RSV from reported patient data in Antananarivo, Madagascar. We found that RSV transmission is primarily concentrated in very young children ([&amp;le;]1 year) in Antananarivo and positively associated with high precipitation and low humidity, which focus most transmission in Madagascars January-February rainy season.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice, or policy: Our study suggests that RSV burden may intensify with future climate change, particularly higher rainfall. We emphasize the high public health importance of accelerating the introduction of recently-developed mAbs (Monoclonal Antibody) and vaccination interventions to combat RSV to low-income settings like Madagascar.

        <p class="abstract">Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure.

ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States.

DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline.

Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems.

Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines.

ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children.

ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A cross-disciplinary rapid scoping review was carried out generally following PRIMA-SCR protocol to examine historical racial and caste-based discrimination as structural determinants of health disparities in the 21st century. We selected 48 peer-reviewed full-text articles available from the University of Memphis Libraries database search, focusing on three selected case-study countries-the United States (US), Canada and Nepal. Authors read each article, extracted highlights and tabulated the thematic contents on structural health disparities attributed to racism or casteism. Results linked the historical racism/casteism to health disparities occurring in Blacks and African Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups in the US, in Indigenous peoples and other visible minorities in Canada, and in Dalits of Nepal, a population racialized by caste, grounded on at least four foundational theories explaining structural determinants of health disparities. The evidence from the literature indicates that genetic variations and biological differences (e.g., disease occurrence) occur within and between races/castes for various reasons (e.g., random gene mutations, geographic isolation, and endogamy). However, historical races/castes as socio-cultural constructs have no inherently exclusive basis of biological differences. Disregarding genetic discrimination based on pseudo-scientific theories, genetic testing is a valuable scientific means to achieve better health of the populations. Epigenetic changes (e.g., weathering - early aging of racialized women) due to DNA methylation of genes among racialized populations are markers of intergenerational trauma due to racial/caste discrimination. Likewise, chronic stresses resulting from intergenerational racial/caste discrimination cause  allostatic load, characterized by an imbalance of neuronal and hormonal dysfunction, leading to occurrences of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, mental health) at disproportionate rates among racialized populations. Major areas identified for reparative policy changes and interventions for eliminating health impacts of racism/casteism include health disparity research, organizational structures, programs and processes, racial justice in population health, cultural trauma, equitable healthcare system, and genetic discrimination.

HighlightsO_LIResearch on the relationship between structural racism and population-level health outcomes and on the health impacts of policy changes and interventions has largely overlooked caste, which is a system of racialization that pre-dates US racial categories.
C_LIO_LIA cross-disciplinary global  caste approach is adopted to examine various forms of historical decent-based racial and caste discrimination in three case-study countries.
C_LIO_LIMajor theories and praxis explaining research and experiences of structural racial and caste discrimination impacting health disparities are consolidated to synthesize a unified body of knowledge for the 21st century.
C_LIO_LIWhile genetic variations occur naturally, they do not inherently contribute to the social constructs of race or caste.
C_LIO_LIReparative policy changes and interventions are necessary to eliminate deeply entrenched structural health disparities rooted in racism and casteism.

        <p class="abstract">ImportancePhase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents showed efficacy in preventing COVID-19 infections. Vaccines may have non-specific effects.

ObjectiveConduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the phase 3 trials to assess overall and non-specific health effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and regulatory websites were searched for RCTs of mRNA vaccines. The latest trial data was included.

Study SelectionAll RCTs conducted with mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 in children and adolescents below 18 years, with placebo, adjuvant, or other vaccines as controls. 1199 studies were screened; six were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and SynthesisData on serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and severe adverse events (&#34;Severe AEs&#34;) as well as organ-specific diseases was extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline, with a focus on non-specific infectious events. Risk Ratios (RRs) comparing vaccine vs placebo were calculated for each vaccine and combined in Mantel-Haenszel estimates.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcomes were SAEs: overall, non-accident SAEs, and infectious SAEs, respectively. Secondary outcomes were Severe AEs and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including RSV.

ResultsThe analyses included 25,549 individuals (17,538 received mRNA; 8,011 received placebo). The risk of SAEs was similar for vaccine and placebo recipients. Both mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of severe AEs in older children. In a combined analysis, the RR was 3.77 (1.56-9.13[0.4% vs 0.1% in vaccine vs placebo recipients]) in above 5 year-olds, and 0.82 (0.53-1.29)[0.8% vs 0.9%])in younger children, who received a lower dose of vaccine (p=0.003 for same effect in older and younger children). In the younger children, mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of LRTI (RR=2.80 (1.32-5.94)[0.6% vs 0.3%]) including a higher risk of RSV infections (RR=2.78 (1.09-7.06)[0.4% vs 0.2%]).

Conclusions and RelevancemRNA vaccines did not increase the risk of SAEs but were associated with an increased risk of severe AEs in older children, and an increased risk of LRTI, including RSV, in the young. Further research into the overall and non-specific health effects of mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>
