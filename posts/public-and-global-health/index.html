Methods: We included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. Results: The median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. Conclusions: In this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.\nEast-West mortality disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic widen the historical longevity divide in Europe.\nAuthors: Shkolnikov, V. M.; Timonin, S.; Jdanov, D.; Islam, N.; Leon, D. A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298275\nFor over half a century, life expectancy in Eastern European (former communist) countries has been appreciably lower than in Western Europe, although this difference has been narrowing since 2000. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these differences. The pandemic reversed the recent convergence and widened the gap to levels observed more than two decades ago (7.9 years for males and 4.9 for females in 2021). Moreover, the trajectory of excess mortality in the pandemic differed between East and West, with the first major peaks in Eastern Europe occurring on average six months after the first peaks seen in Western countries. Despite this, the East suffered greater losses in life expectancy, especially in 2021. This was due to larger relative mortality increases in the East rather than greater frailty of the Eastern European populations as indexed by higher pre-pandemic mortality levels. East-West differences in life expectancy losses in 2021 were substantially explained by COVID-19 vaccination, which together with trust in government accounted for half the gap. We conclude that the East-West differences in life expectancy losses are associated with structural and psychosocial traits that have their roots in the communist era. This includes differences in the connectivity of populations (which drives the differences in timing), as well as profound contrasts in levels of trust in science, authorities, and their capacity to enforce lockdowns and other regulatory measures (driving the huge differences in excess mortality from autumn 2020 onwards).\nPotential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub\nAuthors: Jung, S.-m.; Loo, S.

A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Adiga, A.; Lewis, B.; Klahn, B.; H\nScore: 41.4, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297581\nImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SettingThe entire United States. ParticipantsNone. ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths? FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines. MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.\nEffectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the period January 2021 until May 2022: A systematic literature review\nAuthors: Vardavas, C. I.; Nikitara, K.; Aslanoglou, K.; Marou, V.; Plyta, Z.; Phalkey, R.; Leonardi Bee, J.; Condell, O.; Lamb, F.; Suk, J. E.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298350\nObjectives: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. Design: We searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator. Main outcome measures: Outcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively. Results: 49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive. Conclusions: This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs.\nIschemic Stroke after Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccination: A Self-Controlled Case Series Study\nAuthors: Xu, S.; Sy, L. S.; Hong, V.; Holmquist, K. J.; Qian, L.; Farrington, P.; Bruxvoort, K. J.; Klein, N. P.; Fireman, B.; Han, B.; Lewin, B. J.\nScore: 155.2, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [\u0026ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nRegional variation and epidemiological insights in malaria underestimation in Cameroon\nAuthors: Iyaniwura, S. A.; Han, Q.; Yong, N. B.; Rutayisire, G.; Adom-Konadu, A.; Mbah, O. P.; Tchouassi, D. P.; Badu, K.; Kong, J. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298167\nMalaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, is most common in tropical regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite significant global effort to control and eradicate the disease, many cases and deaths are still reported yearly. These efforts are hindered by several factors, including the severe underestimation of cases and deaths, especially in Africa, making it difficult to assess the disease burden accurately. We used a mathematical model of malaria, incorporating the underestimation of cases and seasonality in mosquito biting rate, to study the disease dynamics in Cameroon. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrated our model to the monthly reported malaria cases in ten regions of Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021 to quantify the underestimation of cases and estimate other important epidemiological parameters. We performed Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components analysis to understand regional disparities, looking at underestimation rates, population sizes, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities per 1,000 people. We found varying levels of underestimation of cases across regions, with the East region having the lowest underestimation (14%) and the Northwest region with the highest (70%). The mosquito biting rate peaks once every year in most of the regions, except in the Northwest region where it peaks every 6.02 months and in Littoral every 15 months. We estimated a median mosquito biting rate of over five bites per day for most of the regions with Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). Two regions have rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day). The notably low estimation of malaria cases in Cameroon underscore the pressing requirement to bolster reporting and surveillance systems. Regions in Cameroon display a range of unique features, which may contribute to the differing levels of malaria underestimation. These distinctions should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of community-based interventions. Author summaryO_LIWe used a deterministic mathematical model of malaria that incorporated the underestimation of cases and seasonality in the biting rate of mosquitoes to retroactively study the dynamics of the disease in Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021. C_LIO_LIWe found varying levels of underestimation of malaria cases across regions in Cameroon, with the East region having 14% underestimation and the Northwest region having 70%. C_LIO_LIWe found consistent malaria-induced death rates and natural immunity duration across Cameroon. We estimated that the mosquito biting rate for the Northwest region oscillated with a period of 6.02 months, while those of the remaining regions had a period of 12 months or more. Most regions had median mosquito biting rates exceeding five bites per day, with the Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). In comparison, two regions had rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day). C_LIO_LIWe clustered the ten regions into four major groups using the case underestimation rate, population size, total healthcare human resources per 1,000, and total healthcare facilities per 1,000. C_LI\nA Systematic Review of the Attitude, Beliefs, and Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine in the Western and Eastern Hemisphere.\nAuthors: Chander, S.; Kumari, R.; Luhana, S.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298274\nBackground: The availability of an effective vaccine does not equate to its use; its effectiveness primarily depends on vaccine acceptance by the targeted population. Despite the rapid development and widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity is yet to be achieved, with vaccine hesitancy as a major barrier. This study sought to systematically assess the beliefs, attitudes, and acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, including factors contributing to vaccination hesitancy in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Methods: A comprehensive search of articles was conducted through Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to May 2023 using the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search yielded 1154, of which 21 were eligible for inclusion. The rate of willingness or intention to vaccinate varied with the geographic region, from 12% in the USA to 93.9% in China. Four studies from the Western and two from Eastern regions reported a low acceptance rate (defined as \u003c50%): USA (12%), Spain (48.3%), Switzerland (38.6%), Europe (multi-national, 31%), Nepal (38.3%), and Oman (43%). Overall, vaccine acceptance was low-to-moderate in the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in both Eastern and Western hemispheres except for China which reported high acceptance (defined as \u003e75%) among the general population and HCWs. Demographic characteristics (female, younger age, and higher education) and non-demographic factors (knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and its development, history of influenza vaccination, perceived susceptibility or severity of infection, and the belief that vaccines are effective in controlling the pandemic were associate with high acceptance rates or intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, mistrust of the vaccine, its safety and effectiveness, disinformation or poor awareness of the vaccine, side effects concerns, belief in natural immunity, previous adverse experience with the vaccines, and distrust in the information sources about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with vaccination hesitancy. Conclusion: For better acceptance, COVID-19 vaccination campaign strategies should be modeled based on regional political, economic, and social contexts.\nGods Lockdown: the effect of the April 2022 Colorado low blizzard on SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the midwest United States\nAuthors: Strobel, S.; Daly, M.\nScore: 18.3, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297908\nBackgroundLockdowns have been used as a primary non-pharmaceutical intervention to stop transmission of COVID19. There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission. MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties. ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19. ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.\nReach and public health implications of proposed new food marketing regulation in Germany: an updated analysis\nAuthors: Leibinger, A.; Holliday, N.; Huizinga, O.; von Philipsborn, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298259\nIntroduction Advertising of unhealthy foods to children is a key public health concern as exposure to such advertising has been shown to adversly affect children's food preferences, choices, purchases and intake. The proposed Children's Food Advertising Act (Kinder-Lebensmittel-Werbegesetz or KLWG) in Germany aims to regulate such marketing by using an adapted version of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe Nutrient Profile Model (WHO NPM). Since the first announcement of the proposed new legislation in February 2023, several revisions to the proposed law have been made. In the present study, we evaluate the reach and public health implications of the planned law's latest draft proposed in June 2023, updating a previously published analysis of the initial proposal. Methods Our analysis is based on a dataset from the open-source online database Open Food Facts, comprising 660 food products randomly selected from the German market. We assigned these products to the 22 food and beverage categories covered the WHO NPM. We then applied the nutrient and ingredient thresholds of the the June 2023 version of the KLWG to this sample to assess the share of products permitted for marketing to children under the proposed legislation. Results Applying the adjustments from the June 2023 KLWG version increased the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children in three product categories, namely plant-based milks (from 70% to 73%), yogurt and cream (from 13% to 73%) and fresh and frozen meat, fish and eggs (from 93% to 100%). Overall, this raised the median share of products across all 22 product categories permitted for marketing to children from 38% to 55%, with an interquartile range of 11%-73%. Conclusion Our previous study found the use of the WHO NPM, as part of the KLWG, to be feasible in the German context and suggested additional threshold adjustments. The latest draft of the KLWG from June 2023 incorporated several of these, substantially increasing the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children. This analysis provides an updated perspective on the evolving debate and its implications for public health.\nDoes domestic violence legislation reduce permissive attitudes about intimate partner violence? Longitudinal evidence from men and women from 61 countries.\nAuthors: Richardson, R.; Hadd, A. R.; Rodriguez-Planas, N.; Wiederkehr, K.; Jamshed, F.; Benmarhnia, T.; Clark, C. J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297413\nBackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) is highly prevalent and has substantial implications for womens health. Changing IPV attitudes is one pathway to reduce IPV. While evidence suggests that interventions targeting individuals may change IPV attitudes, the effect of wider-scale interventions, such as legislation, remain unknown. MethodsWe used individual-level IPV attitudes information collected between 1997 and 2020 by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which we linked with national-level domestic violence (DV) legislation information. We evaluated the effect of adoption of DV legislation on changes in IPV attitudes using a difference-in-differences study design that controlled for time-varying country-level confounding and accounted for staggered timing of legislation adoption. FindingsOur sample included 2,184,047 women from 60 countries and 390,877 men from 40 countries. After controlling for country-level confounders, adoption of DV legislation reduced IPV acceptability among women (average treatment effect among treated (ATT) = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.16, 0.06) and men (ATT = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.22, 0.03) although estimates were imprecise and included the null. InterpretationDV legislation may reduce permissive IPV attitudes, especially among men, although conclusions should be interpreted cautiously due to imprecise estimates. FundingEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (5R00HD104896). PUTTING RESEARCH INTO CONTEXT Evidence before this studyEcological models identify attitudes about intimate partner violence (IPV) as an important driver of IPV. Almost all empirical research has focused on individual-level determinants of permissive IPV attitudes, and the effect of large-scale factors, including domestic violence (DV) legislation, is not well known. We performed a search in Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, without language restrictions, using search terms relevant to DV legislation (e.g., DV law, IPV legislation, etc.) and IPV attitudes (e.g., intimate partner violence beliefs, attitudes on wife beating, perception about acceptability of violence, etc.). The terminal date of this search was May 23, 2023. We also searched reference lists of relevant studies to widen our search. We found two papers that estimated the association between DV legislation and IPV attitudes, both of which investigated multiple individual and contextual risk factors simultaneously using cross-sectional data from a large selection of low-and middle-income countries (i.e., 41 and 49 countries). Both studies found no association between DV legislation and IPV attitudes among women (first study) or among men and women (second study). Added value of this studyThe present study is the first longitudinal assessment of DV legislation on changing IPV attitudes. Prior research was cross-sectional and investigated many determinants simultaneously, which may obscure specific relationships (e.g., by over-controlling for factors that are consequences of changes in IPV attitudes, such as womens household decision-making) and cannot establish temporal ordering (e. g., if countries with less permissive attitudes about IPV enacted legislation vs. if legislation reduced permissive IPV attitudes). Using comprehensive longitudinal data from men and women from 61 countries, coupled with a difference-in-differences study design that accounts for inherent differences across countries, the present study provides the most rigorous evidence to-date of this relationship. Implications for all available evidenceWe found that DV legislation resulted in modest reductions in permissive IPV attitudes among women and slightly more pronounced reduction in permissive IPV attitudes among men, although estimates were imprecise. Given that the majority of IPV is perpetrated by men, coupled with the fact that IPV attitudes is a strong predictor of IPV perpetration, our results suggest that DV legislation may be one strategy to reduce IPV. However, estimates were imprecise, and more research is needed to confirm this relationship. Future research could replicate findings in additional countries and could clarify this relationship among men by exploring specific aspects of DV legislation that may be most relevant for changing IPV attitudes (e.g., criminal sanctions) or evaluate if DV legislation is only effective in the presence of other contextual factors (e.g., equitable gender norms, government institutions with high levels of democracy).\n",

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: A chronic post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) after covid-19 vaccination has been reported but has yet to be well characterized. Methods: We included 241 individuals aged 18 and older who self-reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination and who joined the online Yale Listen to Immune, Symptom and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) Study from May 2022 to July 2023. We summarized their demographics, health status, symptoms, treatments tried, and overall experience. Results: The median age of participants was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38 to 56), with 192 (80%) identifying as female, 209 (87%) as non-Hispanic White, and 211 (88%) from the United States. Among these participants with PVS, 127 (55%) had received the BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] vaccine, and 86 (37%) received the mRNA-1273 [Moderna] vaccine. The median time from the day of index vaccination to symptom onset was three days (IQR: 1 day to 8 days). The time from vaccination to symptom survey completion was 595 days (IQR: 417 to 661 days). The median Euro-QoL visual analogue scale score was 50 (IQR: 39 to 70). The five most common symptoms were exercise intolerance (71%), excessive fatigue (69%), numbness (63%), brain fog (63%), and neuropathy (63%). In the week before survey completion, participants reported feeling unease (93%), fearfulness (82%), and overwhelmed by worries (81%), as well as feelings of helplessness (80%), anxiety (76%), depression (76%), hopelessness (72%), and worthlessness (49%) at least once. Participants reported a median of 20 (IQR: 13 to 30) interventions to treat their condition. Conclusions: In this study, individuals who reported PVS after covid-19 vaccination had low health status, high symptom burden, and high psychosocial stress despite trying many treatments. There is a need for continued investigation to understand and treat this condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For over half a century, life expectancy in Eastern European (former communist) countries has been appreciably lower than in Western Europe, although this difference has been narrowing since 2000. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these differences. The pandemic reversed the recent convergence and widened the gap to levels observed more than two decades ago (7.9 years for males and 4.9 for females in 2021). Moreover, the trajectory of excess mortality in the pandemic differed between East and West, with the first major peaks in Eastern Europe occurring on average six months after the first peaks seen in Western countries. Despite this, the East suffered greater losses in life expectancy, especially in 2021. This was due to larger relative mortality increases in the East rather than greater frailty of the Eastern European populations as indexed by higher pre-pandemic mortality levels. East-West differences in life expectancy losses in 2021 were substantially explained by COVID-19 vaccination, which together with trust in government accounted for half the gap. We conclude that the East-West differences in life expectancy losses are associated with structural and psychosocial traits that have their roots in the communist era. This includes differences in the connectivity of populations (which drives the differences in timing), as well as profound contrasts in levels of trust in science, authorities, and their capacity to enforce lockdowns and other regulatory measures (driving the huge differences in excess mortality from autumn 2020 onwards).</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65&#43;, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65&#43; results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objectives: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs). With this systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission by assessing empirical evidence and data obtained through modelling studies. Design: We searched Medline(OVID) and EMBASE until 26 May 2022. The PICO framework was used to determine the eligibility of the studies. Populations were restricted to studies on humans, and there was no geographical limitation. The included articles assessed NPIs at the regional or national level as mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission for human population without geographical limitation. Unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission or the period before the implementation of the assessed NPI were used as the comparator. Main outcome measures: Outcome indicators were extracted and included COVID-19 cases, incidence and peaks, reproduction rate, growth rate, case mortality, and hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, statistical analysis was not possible and hence the results were presented narratively. Results: 49 studies were included; 21 based on empirical evidence and 28 modelling studies. Among the latter, the effectiveness of facemasks was evaluated in 11 studies, five assessed stay-at-home orders and five school closures. Regarding face mask use, the majority of studies presented a beneficial effect when appropriate social distancing measures could not be maintained. Restrictions on mass gatherings, stay-at-home-orders and lockdown measures were found to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission when timely and properly implemented. The results related to school closures were inconclusive. Conclusions: This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission from January 2021 until May 2022. It suggests the importance of timely implementation and the optimised impact when implementing multiple NPIs in parallel. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of NPIs is required to determine the most suitable nature, time, and duration of the implemented NPIs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination.

MethodsA self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged [&amp;ge;]12 years who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk.

RESULTSWith 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review.

CONCLUSIONSThe potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, is most common in tropical regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite significant global effort to control and eradicate the disease, many cases and deaths are still reported yearly. These efforts are hindered by several factors, including the severe underestimation of cases and deaths, especially in Africa, making it difficult to assess the disease burden accurately. We used a mathematical model of malaria, incorporating the underestimation of cases and seasonality in mosquito biting rate, to study the disease dynamics in Cameroon. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrated our model to the monthly reported malaria cases in ten regions of Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021 to quantify the underestimation of cases and estimate other important epidemiological parameters. We performed Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components analysis to understand regional disparities, looking at underestimation rates, population sizes, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities per 1,000 people. We found varying levels of underestimation of cases across regions, with the East region having the lowest underestimation (14%) and the Northwest region with the highest (70%). The mosquito biting rate peaks once every year in most of the regions, except in the Northwest region where it peaks every 6.02 months and in Littoral every 15 months. We estimated a median mosquito biting rate of over five bites per day for most of the regions with Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). Two regions have rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day). The notably low estimation of malaria cases in Cameroon underscore the pressing requirement to bolster reporting and surveillance systems. Regions in Cameroon display a range of unique features, which may contribute to the differing levels of malaria underestimation. These distinctions should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of community-based interventions.

Author summaryO_LIWe used a deterministic mathematical model of malaria that incorporated the underestimation of cases and seasonality in the biting rate of mosquitoes to retroactively study the dynamics of the disease in Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021.
C_LIO_LIWe found varying levels of underestimation of malaria cases across regions in Cameroon, with the East region having 14% underestimation and the Northwest region having 70%.
C_LIO_LIWe found consistent malaria-induced death rates and natural immunity duration across Cameroon. We estimated that the mosquito biting rate for the Northwest region oscillated with a period of 6.02 months, while those of the remaining regions had a period of 12 months or more. Most regions had median mosquito biting rates exceeding five bites per day, with the Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day). In comparison, two regions had rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day).
C_LIO_LIWe clustered the ten regions into four major groups using the case underestimation rate, population size, total healthcare human resources per 1,000, and total healthcare facilities per 1,000.

        <p class="abstract">Background: The availability of an effective vaccine does not equate to its use; its effectiveness primarily depends on vaccine acceptance by the targeted population. Despite the rapid development and widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity is yet to be achieved, with vaccine hesitancy as a major barrier. This study sought to systematically assess the beliefs, attitudes, and acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, including factors contributing to vaccination hesitancy in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Methods: A comprehensive search of articles was conducted through Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to May 2023 using the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search yielded 1154, of which 21 were eligible for inclusion. The rate of willingness or intention to vaccinate varied with the geographic region, from 12% in the USA to 93.9% in China. Four studies from the Western and two from Eastern regions reported a low acceptance rate (defined as &lt;50%): USA (12%), Spain (48.3%), Switzerland (38.6%), Europe (multi-national, 31%), Nepal (38.3%), and Oman (43%). Overall, vaccine acceptance was low-to-moderate in the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in both Eastern and Western hemispheres except for China which reported high acceptance (defined as &gt;75%) among the general population and HCWs. Demographic characteristics (female, younger age, and higher education) and non-demographic factors (knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and its development, history of influenza vaccination, perceived susceptibility or severity of infection, and the belief that vaccines are effective in controlling the pandemic were associate with high acceptance rates or intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, mistrust of the vaccine, its safety and effectiveness, disinformation or poor awareness of the vaccine, side effects concerns, belief in natural immunity, previous adverse experience with the vaccines, and distrust in the information sources about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with vaccination hesitancy. Conclusion: For better acceptance, COVID-19 vaccination campaign strategies should be modeled based on regional political, economic, and social contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLockdowns have been used as a primary non-pharmaceutical intervention to stop transmission of COVID19. There are many issues with interpreting the causal effects of most of these intentional, policy driven interventions. We leverage a natural experiment to avoid many of these issues to better understand the direct effects of lockdown like conditions on COVID19 transmission.

MethodsWe exploit a blizzard that interrupted activity across several midwestern states in April 2022. This blizzard broke records for snowfall and caused economic disruption. We leverage this to create control and treatment counties that were more or less affected by the snowfall. We demonstrate effects using event studies comparing these treatment and control counties.

ResultsWe find that mobility within treatment counties was severely curtailed as a result of the blizzard relative to control counties. We find cumulative declines in the number of COVID19 cases per country by 400 and cumulative declines in COVID19 deaths by 1 per county over the 30 days after the storm. We find declines in by one per hospitalization due to COVID19.

ConclusionsThe April 2022 blizzard caused disruption in activity across the midwest United States akin to a lockdown. It reduced the number of COVID19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in treatment counties relative to control counties suggesting that similar policies do limit transmissions of SARS-Cov-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Advertising of unhealthy foods to children is a key public health concern as exposure to such advertising has been shown to adversly affect children&#39;s food preferences, choices, purchases and intake. The proposed Children&#39;s Food Advertising Act (Kinder-Lebensmittel-Werbegesetz or KLWG) in Germany aims to regulate such marketing by using an adapted version of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe Nutrient Profile Model (WHO NPM). Since the first announcement of the proposed new legislation in February 2023, several revisions to the proposed law have been made. In the present study, we evaluate the reach and public health implications of the planned law&#39;s latest draft proposed in June 2023, updating a previously published analysis of the initial proposal. Methods Our analysis is based on a dataset from the open-source online database Open Food Facts, comprising 660 food products randomly selected from the German market. We assigned these products to the 22 food and beverage categories covered the WHO NPM. We then applied the nutrient and ingredient thresholds of the the June 2023 version of the KLWG to this sample to assess the share of products permitted for marketing to children under the proposed legislation. Results Applying the adjustments from the June 2023 KLWG version increased the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children in three product categories, namely plant-based milks (from 70% to 73%), yogurt and cream (from 13% to 73%) and fresh and frozen meat, fish and eggs (from 93% to 100%). Overall, this raised the median share of products across all 22 product categories permitted for marketing to children from 38% to 55%, with an interquartile range of 11%-73%. Conclusion Our previous study found the use of the WHO NPM, as part of the KLWG, to be feasible in the German context and suggested additional threshold adjustments. The latest draft of the KLWG from June 2023 incorporated several of these, substantially increasing the proportion of products allowed for marketing to children. This analysis provides an updated perspective on the evolving debate and its implications for public health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) is highly prevalent and has substantial implications for womens health. Changing IPV attitudes is one pathway to reduce IPV. While evidence suggests that interventions targeting individuals may change IPV attitudes, the effect of wider-scale interventions, such as legislation, remain unknown.

MethodsWe used individual-level IPV attitudes information collected between 1997 and 2020 by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which we linked with national-level domestic violence (DV) legislation information. We evaluated the effect of adoption of DV legislation on changes in IPV attitudes using a difference-in-differences study design that controlled for time-varying country-level confounding and accounted for staggered timing of legislation adoption.

FindingsOur sample included 2,184,047 women from 60 countries and 390,877 men from 40 countries. After controlling for country-level confounders, adoption of DV legislation reduced IPV acceptability among women (average treatment effect among treated (ATT) = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.16, 0.06) and men (ATT = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.22, 0.03) although estimates were imprecise and included the null.

InterpretationDV legislation may reduce permissive IPV attitudes, especially among men, although conclusions should be interpreted cautiously due to imprecise estimates.

FundingEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (5R00HD104896).

PUTTING RESEARCH INTO CONTEXT Evidence before this studyEcological models identify attitudes about intimate partner violence (IPV) as an important driver of IPV. Almost all empirical research has focused on individual-level determinants of permissive IPV attitudes, and the effect of large-scale factors, including domestic violence (DV) legislation, is not well known. We performed a search in Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, without language restrictions, using search terms relevant to DV legislation (e.g., DV law, IPV legislation, etc.) and IPV attitudes (e.g., intimate partner violence beliefs, attitudes on wife beating, perception about acceptability of violence, etc.). The terminal date of this search was May 23, 2023. We also searched reference lists of relevant studies to widen our search. We found two papers that estimated the association between DV legislation and IPV attitudes, both of which investigated multiple individual and contextual risk factors simultaneously using cross-sectional data from a large selection of low-and middle-income countries (i.e., 41 and 49 countries). Both studies found no association between DV legislation and IPV attitudes among women (first study) or among men and women (second study).

Added value of this studyThe present study is the first longitudinal assessment of DV legislation on changing IPV attitudes. Prior research was cross-sectional and investigated many determinants simultaneously, which may obscure specific relationships (e.g., by over-controlling for factors that are consequences of changes in IPV attitudes, such as womens household decision-making) and cannot establish temporal ordering (e. g., if countries with less permissive attitudes about IPV enacted legislation vs. if legislation reduced permissive IPV attitudes). Using comprehensive longitudinal data from men and women from 61 countries, coupled with a difference-in-differences study design that accounts for inherent differences across countries, the present study provides the most rigorous evidence to-date of this relationship.

Implications for all available evidenceWe found that DV legislation resulted in modest reductions in permissive IPV attitudes among women and slightly more pronounced reduction in permissive IPV attitudes among men, although estimates were imprecise. Given that the majority of IPV is perpetrated by men, coupled with the fact that IPV attitudes is a strong predictor of IPV perpetration, our results suggest that DV legislation may be one strategy to reduce IPV. However, estimates were imprecise, and more research is needed to confirm this relationship. Future research could replicate findings in additional countries and could clarify this relationship among men by exploring specific aspects of DV legislation that may be most relevant for changing IPV attitudes (e.g., criminal sanctions) or evaluate if DV legislation is only effective in the presence of other contextual factors (e.g., equitable gender norms, government institutions with high levels of democracy).</p>
