J.\nScore: 128.6, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296968\nIntroduction The potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Methods A self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged 12 years and older who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTS With 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals \u003c65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals \u003c65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONS The potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals \u003c65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nEstimating changes in antibiotic consumption with the introduction of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States\nAuthors: Oliveira Roster, K. I.; Grad, Y.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295787\nDoxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.\nMolecular Epidemiology of Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Kalule, J. B.; Bester, L. A.; Banda, D. L.; Derra, F. A.; Chikuse, F.; Tessema, S. K.; Africa PGI Foodborne Diseases Genomic Surveillance Focus Group, ; Foster-Nyarko, E.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296874\nIntroductionDiarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent. MethodsThe review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. ResultsThe reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce. ConclusionDespite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on non-communicable disease patients in sub-Saharan African countries: systematic review\nAuthors: Basa, M. B.; De Vries, J.; McDonagh, D.; Comiskey, C.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296938\nBackgroundCOVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries. MethodThis systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations. FindingsThis review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems. ConclusionThis systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use. The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting. All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.\nHealth Systems Reforms in Bangladesh: An Analysis of the Last Three Decades\nAuthors: Udechukwu, T.; Fofana, T. O.; Carnapete, L.; Haider, S. S.; Hanif, S.; Clech, L.; Ridde, V.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296847\nObjectiveWe reviewed the evidence regarding the health sector reforms implemented in Bangladesh within the past 30 years to understand their impact on the health system and healthcare outcomes. MethodWe completed a scoping review of the most recent and relevant publications on health system reforms in Bangladesh from 1990 through 2023. Studies were included if they identified health sector reforms implemented in the last 30 years in Bangladesh, if they focused on health sector reforms impacting health system dimensions, if they were published between 1991 and 2023 in English or French and were full-text peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, book chapters, grey literature, or reports. ResultsTwenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary health sector reform shifted from a project-based approach to financing the health sector to a sector-wide approach. Studies found that implementing reform initiatives such as expanding community clinics and a voucher scheme improved healthcare access, especially for rural districts. Despite government efforts, there is a significant shortage of formally qualified health professionals, especially nurses and technologists, low public financing, a relatively high percentage of out-of-pocket payments, and significant barriers to healthcare access. ConclusionEvidence suggests that health sector reforms implemented within the last 30 years had a limited impact on health systems. More emphasis should be placed on addressing critical issues such as human resources management and health financing, which may contribute to capacity building to cope with emerging threats, such as climate change.\nAbsence of Care Among Community-Living Older Persons with Dementia and Functional Limitations: A Cross-National Analysis of Population Survey from 22 Countries\nAuthors: Lin, Z.; Qian, Y.; Gill, T. M.; Hou, X.; Chen, S.; Chen, X.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296622\nBackgroundThe provision of long-term care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) who have functional limitations is a significant global public health challenge. However, there is limited evidence on the patterns of care received by PLWD across countries and regions. This study aimed to examine the global trends in the absence of care for PLWD with functional limitations and identify potential sociodemographic disparities. MethodsWe used harmonized longitudinal survey data from four Health and Retirement Global Family of Studies that surveyed community-living persons aged 50 and older in the United States, England, 18 European countries and Israel, and China. The analysis focused on persons who reported functional limitations and developed dementia during the study periods (2012-2018). Functional limitations were assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Absence of care was evaluated as the proportion of PLWD receiving no care for their ADL/IADL limitations. ResultsAt least 20% of PLWD in both developed and developing countries received no care for their functional limitations, and this absence of care remained stable over time. The absence of care was notable for both ADL and IADL limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Moreover, substantial disparities were observed, with less-educated individuals and those living alone experiencing greater absence of formal and informal care, respectively. These patterns and trends were consistent across all countries and regions studied. Discussion and ImplicationsThe findings underscore the pressing need to ensure basic care provision for persons with dementia and functional limitations, especially for those who are less educated or living alone. Policymakers should prioritize addressing these disparities and improving care provision for this population worldwide.\nPublic but ineffective: Fatality inquiries into childhood deaths in Alberta.\nAuthors: Verbeke, M.-C.; Mitchell, I.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296196\nIntroductionChild Death Review (CDR) processes are public efforts to review a childs death to understand how and why children die, to improve child health and to prevent future deaths. In 2013, the Canadian Paediatric Society made specific recommendations to establish structured and comprehensive CDR systems in each province and territory. In Alberta, there is no comprehensive CDR process but there are some components. The most public and probably the most expensive component is the public fatality inquiry. A new notification policy adopted after in June 2017 appears to be of limited value for child death prevention. MethodsWe examined all Alberta fatality inquiry reports from January 1, 1995 to April 15, 2023 concerning children aged 0-17 years (n=133) to determine whether the fatality inquiry system might be effective in preventing future similar deaths. ResultsRecommendations made by judges in a fatality inquiry were not always followed by action, and hence inquiry recommendations have been largely ineffective. Fatality inquiry recommendations were sometimes untimely, and therefore had little chance of being effective. There is an increasing trend from 1995 (case 1) to 2023 (case 133) in the time taken to initiate a child fatality inquiry review. Discussion and ConclusionInformation and recommendations from fatality inquiries into Alberta childhood deaths tend to be delayed and not followed by action. A comprehensive CDR process is required in Alberta. With system changes, public fatality inquiries could be an effective part of the child death prevention process.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Introduction The potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke remains uncertain, despite several studies conducted thus far. The purpose is to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke following bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Methods A self-controlled case series study was conducted among members aged 12 years and older who experienced ischemic stroke between September 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in a large California health care system. Ischemic strokes were identified using ICD-10 codes in Emergency Department and inpatient settings. Exposures were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Risk intervals were pre-specified as 1-21 days and 1-42 days after bivalent COVID-19 vaccination; all non-risk-interval person-time served as control interval. We conducted overall and subgroup analyses by age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and co-administration of influenza vaccine. When an elevated risk was detected, we performed chart review of ischemic strokes, and re-evaluated the risk. RESULTS With 4933 cases, we found no increased risk within 21-day risk interval across vaccines and by subgroups. However, an elevated risk emerged within 42-day risk interval among individuals &lt;65 years who received co-administration of Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine and influenza vaccine on the same day; relative incidence (RI) was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.02-4.49). Among those who also had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 3.94 (95% CI, 1.10-14.16). After chart review, RIs were 2.35 (95% CI, 0.98-5.65) and 4.33 (95% CI, 0.98-19.11), respectively. Among individuals &lt;65 years who received Moderna bivalent vaccine and had history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RI was 2.62 (95% CI, 1.13-6.03) before chart review and 2.24 (95% CI, 0.78-6.47) after chart review. CONCLUSIONS The potential association between bivalent COVID-19 vaccination and ischemic stroke in the 1-42-day analysis warrants further investigation among individuals &lt;65 years with influenza vaccine co-administration and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) on HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and people living with HIV (PLWH)). Doxy-PEP is an important tool to address the increasing burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but there is concern that increased consumption of doxycycline may drive antimicrobial resistance. We estimated the expected increase in antibiotic use in the US under several doxy-PEP prescribing scenarios. We accounted for doses of antibiotics that may be averted due to the prevention of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infections by doxy-PEP. Under a scenario of 75% adoption among the eligible population, with rates of consumption similar to the DoxyPEP trial population, monthly antibiotic consumption would increase by around 2.52 million doses, driven by doxy-PEP consumption of 2.58 million doses and less 62.1 thousand antibiotic doses that would otherwise have been used for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionDiarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent.

MethodsThe review selectively focused on studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources, and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Employing a robust search strategy, pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines.

ResultsThe reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI: 30% - 55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95%CI: 17% - 32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce.

ConclusionDespite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning the actual impact and resistance continuum of DEC in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 and its prevention measures have had a significant impact on patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by disrupting routine healthcare service and increasing risk factors. These challenges were expected to be more severe in sub-Saharan Africa due to the lack of physical infrastructure and inadequate resources. The quantity of studies conducted was limited, and there was a lack of published systematic reviews in the specified region. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively assess the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan Countries.

MethodThis systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42023387755). Extensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases in November 2022, supplemented by a manual search of references, grey literature, and the WHO COVID-19 database. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that reported on the impact of COVID-19 on NCD patients in sub-Saharan African countries, focusing on access to care, health outcomes, and factors related to NCDs. Critical appraisal of study quality was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) analytical cross-sectional studies critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted and synthesized, highlighting the main findings and relevant limitations.

FindingsThis review included 26 primary studies with a cumulative sample size of 15,722 participants, conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries. Findings of these studies identified that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption of 76% to 80% of regular NCDs patient care provision. The studies also identified a reduction in patient health-seeking behavior and reduced medication adherence (39.0%-63%), leading to poor treatment outcome (35.66%-55.8%). Furthermore, the pandemic and related lockdowns have been implicated in the increased prevalence of substance use, decreased physical exercise, and increased mental health problems.

ConclusionThis systematic review identified the complex challenges faced by NCD patients in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also underlines the need to consider the indirect impact on vulnerable populations while developing pandemic prevention and control strategies for the future. The current NCD management strategies should prioritize the restoration of access to essential healthcare services while considering the multifaceted risks posed by decreased physical activity, poor dietary practices, and increased substance use.

The main limitation of this review was the study design and setting. All of the studies included in this review employed a cross-sectional design, which may result in a low quality of evidence. This study identified research conducted in only six countries among the 46 UN-classified sub-Saharan nations, which may impair the generalizability of the result.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveWe reviewed the evidence regarding the health sector reforms implemented in Bangladesh within the past 30 years to understand their impact on the health system and healthcare outcomes.

MethodWe completed a scoping review of the most recent and relevant publications on health system reforms in Bangladesh from 1990 through 2023. Studies were included if they identified health sector reforms implemented in the last 30 years in Bangladesh, if they focused on health sector reforms impacting health system dimensions, if they were published between 1991 and 2023 in English or French and were full-text peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, book chapters, grey literature, or reports.

ResultsTwenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary health sector reform shifted from a project-based approach to financing the health sector to a sector-wide approach. Studies found that implementing reform initiatives such as expanding community clinics and a voucher scheme improved healthcare access, especially for rural districts. Despite government efforts, there is a significant shortage of formally qualified health professionals, especially nurses and technologists, low public financing, a relatively high percentage of out-of-pocket payments, and significant barriers to healthcare access.

ConclusionEvidence suggests that health sector reforms implemented within the last 30 years had a limited impact on health systems. More emphasis should be placed on addressing critical issues such as human resources management and health financing, which may contribute to capacity building to cope with emerging threats, such as climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe provision of long-term care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) who have functional limitations is a significant global public health challenge. However, there is limited evidence on the patterns of care received by PLWD across countries and regions. This study aimed to examine the global trends in the absence of care for PLWD with functional limitations and identify potential sociodemographic disparities.

MethodsWe used harmonized longitudinal survey data from four Health and Retirement Global Family of Studies that surveyed community-living persons aged 50 and older in the United States, England, 18 European countries and Israel, and China. The analysis focused on persons who reported functional limitations and developed dementia during the study periods (2012-2018). Functional limitations were assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Absence of care was evaluated as the proportion of PLWD receiving no care for their ADL/IADL limitations.

ResultsAt least 20% of PLWD in both developed and developing countries received no care for their functional limitations, and this absence of care remained stable over time. The absence of care was notable for both ADL and IADL limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Moreover, substantial disparities were observed, with less-educated individuals and those living alone experiencing greater absence of formal and informal care, respectively. These patterns and trends were consistent across all countries and regions studied.

Discussion and ImplicationsThe findings underscore the pressing need to ensure basic care provision for persons with dementia and functional limitations, especially for those who are less educated or living alone. Policymakers should prioritize addressing these disparities and improving care provision for this population worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionChild Death Review (CDR) processes are public efforts to review a childs death to understand how and why children die, to improve child health and to prevent future deaths. In 2013, the Canadian Paediatric Society made specific recommendations to establish structured and comprehensive CDR systems in each province and territory. In Alberta, there is no comprehensive CDR process but there are some components. The most public and probably the most expensive component is the public fatality inquiry. A new notification policy adopted after in June 2017 appears to be of limited value for child death prevention.

MethodsWe examined all Alberta fatality inquiry reports from January 1, 1995 to April 15, 2023 concerning children aged 0-17 years (n=133) to determine whether the fatality inquiry system might be effective in preventing future similar deaths.

ResultsRecommendations made by judges in a fatality inquiry were not always followed by action, and hence inquiry recommendations have been largely ineffective. Fatality inquiry recommendations were sometimes untimely, and therefore had little chance of being effective. There is an increasing trend from 1995 (case 1) to 2023 (case 133) in the time taken to initiate a child fatality inquiry review.

Discussion and ConclusionInformation and recommendations from fatality inquiries into Alberta childhood deaths tend to be delayed and not followed by action. A comprehensive CDR process is required in Alberta. With system changes, public fatality inquiries could be an effective part of the child death prevention process.</p>
