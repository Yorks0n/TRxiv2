ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States. DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline. Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems. Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines. ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children. ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\nCore outcome sets for trials of interventions to prevent and to treat multimorbidity in low- and middle-income countries: the COSMOS study\nAuthors: Vidyasagaran, A. L.; Ayesha, R.; Boehnke, J. R.; Kirkham, J. J.; Rose, L.; Hurst, J. R.; Miranda, J. J.; Rana, R. Z.; Vedanthan, R.; Faisal, M. R.; Siddiqi, N.; The COSMOS Collaboration, Score: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301589\nIntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective evidence-based interventions. A core outcome set (COS) appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMIC contexts does not presently exist. This is required to standardise reporting and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two COS for intervention trials aimed at the prevention and treatment of multimorbidity in LMICs. MethodsTo generate a comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with multimorbidity and their caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four stakeholder groups with representation from 33 countries (people with multimorbidity/caregivers, multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers). Consensus meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS. Registration: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580. ResultsThe systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24 outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention, and six treatment outcomes were added from Delphi round one. Delphi round two surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round one participants (72.0%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4%) participants for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) Adverse events, (2) Development of new comorbidity, (3) Health risk behaviour, and (4) Quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1) Adherence to treatment, (2) Adverse events, (3) Out-of-pocket expenditure, and (4) Quality of life. ConclusionFollowing established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment, specific to LMIC contexts. We recommend their inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMICs. KEY MESSAGESWhat is already known on this topic? Although a Core Outcome Set (COS) for the study of multimorbidity has been previously developed, it does not include contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the important differences in disease patterns and healthcare systems between high-income country (HIC) and LMIC contexts, a fit-for-purpose COS for the study of multimorbidity specific to LMICs is urgently needed. What this study addsFollowing rigorous guidelines and best practice recommendations for developing COS, we have identified four core outcomes for including in trials of interventions for the prevention and four for the treatment of multimorbidity in LMIC settings. The outcomes Adverse events and Quality of life (including Health-related quality of life) featured in both prevention and treatment COS. In addition, the prevention COS included Development of new comorbidity and Health risk behaviour, whereas the treatment COS included Adherence to treatment and Out-of-pocket expenditure outcomes. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe multimorbidity prevention and treatment COS will inform future trials and intervention study designs by helping promote consistency in outcome selection and reporting. COS for multimorbidity interventions that are context-sensitive will likely contribute to reduced research waste, harmonise outcomes to be measured across trials, and advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMIC settings to enhance health outcomes for those living with multimorbidity.\nHeterogeneity in deaths of despair: excess mortality in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Kandula, S.; Keyes, K. M.; Shaman, J.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301291\nThe impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.\nFactors associated with decreased anal sphincter tone and the accuracy of forced anal examinations to detect individuals having receptive anal intercourse: An observational study\nAuthors: Nyitray, A.; Rosser, B. R. S.; Hazra, A.; Nitkowski, J.; Smith, D.; Brzezinski, B.; Ridolfi, T. J.; Schneider, J.; Chiao, E. Y.; Sanos, S.; Mkonyi, E.; Mgopa, L. R.; Ross, M. W.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302098\nObjective and DesignForced anal examinations are used to prosecute sexual and gender minorities (SGM) in at least seven countries under the presumption that decreased sphincter tone, estimated by a finger inserted into the anal canal, can detect persons practicing receptive anal intercourse. In a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from a longitudinal study, we aimed to determine factors associated with sphincter tone and the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect persons engaging in receptive anal intercourse. SettingClinicians in Chicago, Houston, and Milwaukee, USA conducted digital anal rectal examinations (DARE) on 838 participants, 94.0% of whom were cisgendered males. Clinicians used the Digital Rectal Examination Scoring System to score sphincter resting tone (RT) and squeeze tone (ST). On a separate survey, individuals reported their preferred position for anal intercourse: i.e., either always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, always/mostly receptive anal intercourse, or both receptive and insertive anal intercourse. Multivariable regression assessed factors associated with decreased sphincter tone while area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC) estimated the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect receptive anal intercourse. Results11.3% had decreased RT (95/838) and 6.3% had decreased ST (53/838). The accuracy of DARE to detect any receptive anal intercourse was little better than random guessing (AUC 0.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.55, and AUC 0.51, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.53, respectively. RT and ST decreased with age regardless of sexual behavior (ptrend\u003c0.01 for both). Compared to individuals having always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, individuals having always/mostly receptive anal intercourse was associated with decreased RT, but not ST, while those equally preferring both insertive and receptive anal intercourse were not associated with decreased RT or ST. ConclusionsDecreased sphincter tone is uncommon among SGM who prefer receptive anal intercourse. Given virtually no accuracy, a finger inserted into the anus has no utility to detect individuals practicing receptive anal intercourse and thus should not be used as such. Trial registrationNCT04090060 Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSTo gather evidence for prosecution of sexual and gender minorities, forced anal exams are used in multiple countries. The examination includes inserting the index finger into the anal canal to detect decreased sphincter tone which is considered evidence of receptive anal intercourse. We found only two small studies (n= 58 and n=24) assessing factors associated with decreased sphincter tone and none assessing the accuracy of sphincter tone to detect sexual and gender minorities having receptive anal intercourse. What this study addsOur study suggests that a finger inserted into the anal canal is not useful to detect a history of receptive anal intercourse. As such, the sexual practices of individuals cannot be known using a forced anal examination.\nAn ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties\nAuthors: Ali, S.; Azarian, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301823\nBackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves. MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors. ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p \u003c 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.\nInformation Bottlenecks in Forecasting COVID-19\nAuthors: Gamarnik, D.; Ma, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24302003\nReliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate. In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20+ days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the \"memoryless\" property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.\nThe Uptake of Critical Perspectives in the Field of Global Mental Health: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis\nAuthors: Limenih, G.; Nouvet, E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301044\nAn emancipatory movement is surging within the of global mental health (GMH) field, advancing the groundwork laid by scholars who champion a more critical, self-reflective, decolonized, and socially responsive discipline. As GMH enters its second decade, there have been numerous critiques of its origins and underlying paradigms, with increasing emphasis on critical approaches in recent publications. However, there is no comprehensive synthesis has yet been undertaken to understand how critical perspectives have been integrated into the GMH literature. To contribute to the ongoing discourse aimed at cultivating GMH as a critical and socially responsive discipline, this article employed the critical interpretive synthesis method. critical interpretive synthesis is designed to navigate the synthesis of extensive and diverse literature while actively engaging with the foundational assumptions that shape and inform the body of research via employing a critical lens to scrutinize the data. We conducted searches using PubMed, MEDLINE(OVID), PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE data bases; published between 2007 and February 2023. We included 58 articles that have embraced critical perspectives, whether explicitly or implicitly. Through this iterative process, five distinct themes or \"four turns\" emerge: (1) the inward turn, focusing on the \"local\" as a source of alterity, resistance, and critique; (2) turning the critical lens outward or political turn; (3) the push for a broader agenda; and (4) the reflexive turn. This article discusses the implications of four \"turns\" in how critical perspectives have been and are being used, in relation to the goal of developing as a socially responsive discipline.\nComparing surveyed adults with long COVID and those with just a positive test helps put COVID into perspective\nAuthors: Adams, M.; Grandpre, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302216\nIntroduction: Among adults who test positive for COVID-19, some develop long COVID (symptoms lasting [\u0026ge;]3 months), and some do not. We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact. Methods: Using Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states). Results: Prevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [\u0026ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [\u0026ge;]3 vaccines vs. \u003c3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%. Conclusions: Results show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes post-licensure.

ObjectiveTo evaluate health outcomes following bivalent COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) vaccination among individuals 6 months and older in the United States.

DesignMonthly monitoring of health outcomes from August 2022 to July 2023 in four administrative claims databases. Descriptive analyses monitored vaccine uptake, outcome counts and coadministration of bivalent COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Sequential analyses tested for elevated risk of each outcome in a prespecified post-vaccination risk interval, or a period of hypothesized elevation based on clinical guidance, compared to a historical baseline.

Participants and ExposuresPersons 6 months and older who received a bivalent COVID-19 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccine during the study period, with continuous enrollment in a medical insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean interval to the COVID-19 vaccination date. Vaccines were identified using product-specific codes from medical coding systems.

Health OutcomesTwenty outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 6 months-4 years, and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6 months-5 years. Twenty-one outcomes were monitored in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients 5-17 years and mRNA-1273.222 vaccine recipients 6-17 years. Eighteen outcomes were monitored in persons 18 years and older for both mRNA vaccines.

ResultsOverall, 13.9 million individuals 6 months and older received a single bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The statistical threshold for a signal was met for two outcomes in one database: anaphylaxis following bivalent BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273.222 vaccines in persons 18-64 years and myocarditis/pericarditis following bivalent BNT162b2 vaccines in individuals 18-35 years. There were no signals identified in young children.

ConclusionsResults were consistent with prior observations from published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety. This study supports the safety profile of bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the conclusion that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective evidence-based interventions. A core outcome set (COS) appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMIC contexts does not presently exist. This is required to standardise reporting and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two COS for intervention trials aimed at the prevention and treatment of multimorbidity in LMICs.

MethodsTo generate a comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with multimorbidity and their caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four stakeholder groups with representation from 33 countries (people with multimorbidity/caregivers, multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers). Consensus meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS. Registration: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580.

ResultsThe systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24 outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention, and six treatment outcomes were added from Delphi round one. Delphi round two surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round one participants (72.0%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4%) participants for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) Adverse events, (2) Development of new comorbidity, (3) Health risk behaviour, and (4) Quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1) Adherence to treatment, (2) Adverse events, (3) Out-of-pocket expenditure, and (4) Quality of life.

ConclusionFollowing established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment, specific to LMIC contexts. We recommend their inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMICs.

KEY MESSAGESWhat is already known on this topic? Although a Core Outcome Set (COS) for the study of multimorbidity has been previously developed, it does not include contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the important differences in disease patterns and healthcare systems between high-income country (HIC) and LMIC contexts, a fit-for-purpose COS for the study of multimorbidity specific to LMICs is urgently needed.


What this study addsFollowing rigorous guidelines and best practice recommendations for developing COS, we have identified four core outcomes for including in trials of interventions for the prevention and four for the treatment of multimorbidity in LMIC settings.
The outcomes  Adverse events and  Quality of life (including Health-related quality of life) featured in both prevention and treatment COS. In addition, the prevention COS included  Development of new comorbidity and  Health risk behaviour, whereas the treatment COS included  Adherence to treatment and  Out-of-pocket expenditure outcomes.


How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe multimorbidity prevention and treatment COS will inform future trials and intervention study designs by helping promote consistency in outcome selection and reporting.
COS for multimorbidity interventions that are context-sensitive will likely contribute to reduced research waste, harmonise outcomes to be measured across trials, and advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMIC settings to enhance health outcomes for those living with multimorbidity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impact of Covid-19 on mortality includes both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects mediated through other causal pathways. In the United States, the indirect effects, particularly from suicides, overdoses and alcohol-induced causes (i.e. deaths of despair) (1) are understudied. Here, we estimated excess non-Covid deaths and deaths of despair, in the US overall, in each state and in 72 demographic strata. Nationally, 114,230 (127,597) excess non-Covid deaths, 19,074 (33,559) excess poisoning deaths and 8,746 (13,771) excess alcohol-induced deaths were estimated during 2020 (2021). Excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality were highest among the 35-44 and the 55-64 year groups, respectively. The Black and the American Indian/Alaskan Native populations had the highest excess poisoning and alcohol-induced mortality, respectively. Fewer suicides than expected occurred nationally, but excess suicides were estimated among Black youth. These findings suggest that additional resources need to be mobilized to limit increases in deaths of despair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective and DesignForced anal examinations are used to prosecute sexual and gender minorities (SGM) in at least seven countries under the presumption that decreased sphincter tone, estimated by a finger inserted into the anal canal, can detect persons practicing receptive anal intercourse. In a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from a longitudinal study, we aimed to determine factors associated with sphincter tone and the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect persons engaging in receptive anal intercourse.

SettingClinicians in Chicago, Houston, and Milwaukee, USA conducted digital anal rectal examinations (DARE) on 838 participants, 94.0% of whom were cisgendered males. Clinicians used the Digital Rectal Examination Scoring System to score sphincter resting tone (RT) and squeeze tone (ST). On a separate survey, individuals reported their preferred position for anal intercourse: i.e., either always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, always/mostly receptive anal intercourse, or both receptive and insertive anal intercourse. Multivariable regression assessed factors associated with decreased sphincter tone while area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUC) estimated the accuracy of sphincter tonality to detect receptive anal intercourse.

Results11.3% had decreased RT (95/838) and 6.3% had decreased ST (53/838). The accuracy of DARE to detect any receptive anal intercourse was little better than random guessing (AUC 0.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.55, and AUC 0.51, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.53, respectively. RT and ST decreased with age regardless of sexual behavior (ptrend&lt;0.01 for both). Compared to individuals having always/mostly insertive anal intercourse, individuals having always/mostly receptive anal intercourse was associated with decreased RT, but not ST, while those equally preferring both insertive and receptive anal intercourse were not associated with decreased RT or ST.

ConclusionsDecreased sphincter tone is uncommon among SGM who prefer receptive anal intercourse. Given virtually no accuracy, a finger inserted into the anus has no utility to detect individuals practicing receptive anal intercourse and thus should not be used as such.

Trial registrationNCT04090060

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSTo gather evidence for prosecution of sexual and gender minorities, forced anal exams are used in multiple countries. The examination includes inserting the index finger into the anal canal to detect decreased sphincter tone which is considered evidence of receptive anal intercourse. We found only two small studies (n= 58 and n=24) assessing factors associated with decreased sphincter tone and none assessing the accuracy of sphincter tone to detect sexual and gender minorities having receptive anal intercourse.

What this study addsOur study suggests that a finger inserted into the anal canal is not useful to detect a history of receptive anal intercourse. As such, the sexual practices of individuals cannot be known using a forced anal examination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida reported some of the highest number of cases and deaths in the US; however, county-level variation in COVID-19 outcomes has not been comprehensively investigated. The present ecological study aimed to assess corelates of COVID-19 outcomes among Florida counties that explain variation in case rates, mortality rates, and case fatality rates (CFR) across pandemic waves.

MethodWe obtained county-level administrative data and COVID-19 case reports from public repositories. We tested spatial autocorrelation to assess geographic clustering in COVID-19 outcomes: case rate, mortality rate, and CFR. Stepwise linear regression was employed to test the association between case, death, and CFR and 18 demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related county-level predictors.

ResultsWe found mortality rate and CFR were significantly higher in rural counties compared to urban counties, among which significant differences in vaccination coverage was also observed. Multivariate analysis found that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, the percentage of the obese people, and the percentage of rural population were significant predictors of COVID-19 case rate. Median age, vaccination coverage, percentage of people who smoke, and percentage of the population with diabetes were significant influencing factors for CFR. Importantly, vaccination coverage was significantly associated with a reduction in case rate (R = - 0.26, p = 0.03) and mortality (R = -0.51, p &lt; 0.001). Last, we found that spatial dependencies play a role in explaining variations in COVID-19 CFR among Florida counties.

ConclusionOur findings emphasize the need for targeted, equitable public health strategies to reduce disparities and enhance population resilience during public health crises. We further inform future spatial-epidemiological analyses and present actionable data for policies related to preparedness and response to current and future epidemics in Florida and elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reliable short term and long term forecasting of the number of COVID-19 incidences is a task of clear importance. Numerous attempts for such forecasting have been attempted historically since the onset of the pandemic. While many successful short-term forecasting models have been put forward, predictions for mid-range time intervals (few weeks) and long-range ones (few months to half a year) appeared to be largely inaccurate.

In this paper we investigate systematically the question as to what extend such predictions are even possible given the information available at the times when the predictions are made. We demonstrate that predictions on the daily basis is practically impossible beyond the horizon of 20&#43; days, and predictions on the weekly basis is similarly impossible beyond the horizon of roughly half a year. We arrive at this conclusion by computing information bottlenecks arising in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bottlenecks stem from the &#34;memoryless&#34; property of the stochastic dynamical systems describing COVID-19 evolution, specifically from the so-called mixing rate of the system. The mixing rate is then used to gage the rate at which the information used at a time when predictions are made no longer impacts the actual outcomes of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An emancipatory movement is surging within the of global mental health (GMH) field, advancing the groundwork laid by scholars who champion a more critical, self-reflective, decolonized, and socially responsive discipline. As GMH enters its second decade, there have been numerous critiques of its origins and underlying paradigms, with increasing emphasis on critical approaches in recent publications. However, there is no comprehensive synthesis has yet been undertaken to understand how critical perspectives have been integrated into the GMH literature. To contribute to the ongoing discourse aimed at cultivating GMH as a critical and socially responsive discipline, this article employed the critical interpretive synthesis method. critical interpretive synthesis is designed to navigate the synthesis of extensive and diverse literature while actively engaging with the foundational assumptions that shape and inform the body of research via employing a critical lens to scrutinize the data. We conducted searches using PubMed, MEDLINE(OVID), PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE data bases; published between 2007 and February 2023. We included 58 articles that have embraced critical perspectives, whether explicitly or implicitly. Through this iterative process, five distinct themes or &#34;four turns&#34; emerge: (1) the inward turn, focusing on the &#34;local&#34; as a source of alterity, resistance, and critique; (2) turning the critical lens outward or political turn; (3) the push for a broader agenda; and (4) the reflexive turn. This article discusses the implications of four &#34;turns&#34; in how critical perspectives have been and are being used, in relation to the goal of developing as a socially responsive discipline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Among adults who test positive for COVID-19, some develop long COVID (symptoms lasting [&amp;ge;]3 months), and some do not. We compared 3 groups on selected measures to help determine strategies to reduce COVID impact. Methods: Using Stata and data for 385,617 adults from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we compared adults reporting long COVID, those with just a positive test, and those who never tested positive, on several health status and risk factor measures plus vaccination rates (data for 178,949 adults in 29 states). Results: Prevalence of just COVID was 26.5% (95% CI 26.2-26.8) and long COVID was 7.4% (7.3-7.6). Compared with adults with just COVID those with long COVID had worse rates for 13 of 17 measures of chronic disease, disability, and poor health status, while those with just COVID had the best results for 15 of the 17 measures among all 3 groups. The 5 risk factors (obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and COPD) previously associated with COVID deaths, increased long COVID but not just COVID rates, which were highest among younger and higher income adults. Adults with long COVID had the highest rate among the 3 groups for any COVID risk factors and data from 29 states showed they had the lowest rates for [&amp;ge;]3 vaccine doses of 35.6%, vs. 42.7% and 50.3% for those with just a positive test, and neither, respectively. Vaccination with [&amp;ge;]3 vaccines vs. &lt;3 reduced long COVID rates by 38%, and just COVID rates by 16%. Conclusions: Results show the seriousness of long COVID vs. just a positive test and that increasing vaccine coverage by targeting adults with risk factors shows promise for reducing COVID impact.</p>
