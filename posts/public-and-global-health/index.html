J.; Malloum, K. B.; Cantalino, J.; Signor, C.; Leclerc, P.; Bergeron, G.; Mercure, S.-A.; Cadieux, G.\nScore: 149.4, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300022\nBackground. Meta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. Methods. Follow-up study by telephone re-interview, [\u0026ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. Results. Of a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). Interpretation. Our findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.\nAsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections tend to occur less frequently in developed nations\nAuthors: Chowdhury, S.; Tiwari, A.; James, A.; Chatterjee, B.; Dixit, N. M.\nScore: 29.8, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299954\nUnlike severe infections, asymptomatic infections occur independently of healthcare access and reflect the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. What determines their prevalence,{psi} , and its variation across nations is unknown. We conducted a systematic review of serosurveys performed on samples representative of national populations before vaccination and the emergence of variants. The studies that met our selection criteria together sampled 4,58,489 individuals and yielded estimates of{psi} in 33 nations. Using random-effects modeling, we found the pooled global{psi} to be 45.3% (95% CI: 33.6%-57.5%).{psi} varied widely across nations (range: 6%-96%; I2=99.7%), highlighting the enormous underlying variation in the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Performing meta-regression with national-level metrics, we found that the human development index (HDI) was negatively correlated with{psi} (p=10-13; R2=65.5%). More developed nations thus experienced less frequent asymptomatic infections on average. These findings have implications for unraveling the origins of asymptomatic infections and for future pandemic preparedness.\nAn electronic cigarette pod system delivering 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog, marketed in the United States as \"PMTA exempt\"\nAuthors: Jordt, S. E.; Jabba, S. V.; Silinski, P.; Berman, M. L.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298778\nAs of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as \"PMTA exempt\", with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing \"Metatine\", a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of \"nicotine\" within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background. Meta-analyses suggest that post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) mostly takes three clinical presentations: fatigue, cognitive and respiratory. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these presentations and the strength of their associations with potential risk/protective factors, activity limitations and healthcare utilization. Methods. Follow-up study by telephone re-interview, [&amp;ge;]5 months after initial interview, of a random sample of Montrealers aged 18 years or more, with a PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection reported between July 18 and December 4, 2021. The re-interview covered age, sex, comorbidities, signs and symptoms (SS), activity limitations, healthcare utilization, perceived stigmatization and psychological distress. Results. Of a sample of 2000 adults, 652 (39.1%) completed the questionnaire. Of 518 with only 1 acute episode of COVID-19, 32.2% met the WHO definition of PCC. Of these, 45.5% reported SS that fit the fatigue presentation, 24.6% the cognitive presentation and 16.8% the respiratory presentation. Neither age nor COVID-19 immunization was associated with PCC, compared to COVID-19 without PCC. However, being female (OR=2.28), hospitalization (OR=2.44) and intensive care (OR=3.21) for the acute COVID-19 episode were. Various activity limitations and types of healthcare utilization were also associated with PCC. All presentations were associated with serious psychological distress. The respiratory presentation was particularly associated with hospitalization for the acute episode (aOR=7.72) and was the only one associated with later hospitalization (aOR=23.6). Interpretation. Our findings suggest that caring for patients with PCC requires adapted organizational models. If they favoured excellence in research, these models could help future studies meet the recommended methodological standards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unlike severe infections, asymptomatic infections occur independently of healthcare access and reflect the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. What determines their prevalence,{psi} , and its variation across nations is unknown. We conducted a systematic review of serosurveys performed on samples representative of national populations before vaccination and the emergence of variants. The studies that met our selection criteria together sampled 4,58,489 individuals and yielded estimates of{psi} in 33 nations. Using random-effects modeling, we found the pooled global{psi} to be 45.3% (95% CI: 33.6%-57.5%).{psi} varied widely across nations (range: 6%-96%; I2=99.7%), highlighting the enormous underlying variation in the natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Performing meta-regression with national-level metrics, we found that the human development index (HDI) was negatively correlated with{psi} (p=10-13; R2=65.5%). More developed nations thus experienced less frequent asymptomatic infections on average. These findings have implications for unraveling the origins of asymptomatic infections and for future pandemic preparedness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As of April 14, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been authorized to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic, requiring manufacturers to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA). A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids or other synthetic nicotine analogs could be used by manufacturers to bypass regulatory schemes focusing on nicotine alone. From October 2023 on, vape stores in the United States started selling a new electronic cigarette pod system, named Spree Bar, advertised as &#34;PMTA exempt&#34;, with youth-appealing flavors and advertising. The products are marketed as containing &#34;Metatine&#34;, a trademarked name for 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog patented by a Chinese electronic cigarette manufacturer. Here we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to confirm the presence of a chemical species with the molecular weight of 6-methyl nicotine in Spree Bar e-liquids. The FDA needs to determine whether, in its view, 6-methyl nicotine is a form of &#34;nicotine&#34; within the meaning of the Tobacco Control Act, or whether 6-methyl nicotine can be regulated as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).</p>
