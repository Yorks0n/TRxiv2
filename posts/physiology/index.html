J.; Bajwa, A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573206\nObesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.\nAge-dependent RGS5 loss in pericytes induces cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in the heart\nAuthors: Tamiato, A.; Tombor, L.

T.; John, D.; Fleming, I.; Wettschureck, N.; Dimmeler, S.; Luxan, G.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570774\nBackgroundAgeing is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Pericytes are capillary-associated mural cells involved in the maintenance and stability of the vascular network. In the heart, the consequences of ageing on cardiac pericytes are unknown. MethodsIn this study, we have combined single nucleus RNA sequencing and histological analysis to determine the effects of ageing on cardiac pericytes. Furthermore, we have conducted in vivo and in vitro analysis of RGS5 loss of function and finally have perfomed pericytes-fibroblasts co-culture studies to understand the effect of RGS5 loss of function in pericytes on the neighbouring fibroblasts. ResultsWe showed that ageing reduces the pericyte area and coverage. Single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis further revealed that the expression of the Regulator of G protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) is reduced in old cardiac pericytes. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that the deletion of RGS5 induces morphological changes and a pro-fibrotic gene expression signature characterized by the expression of different extracellular matrix components and growth factors like TGFB2 and PDGFB in pericytes. Indeed, the culture of fibroblasts with the supernatant of RGS5 deficient pericytes induced their activation characterized by the increased expression of smooth muscle actin in a TFG{beta}2 dependent mechanism. ConclusionsOur results identify RGS5 as a crucial regulator of pericyte function during cardiac ageing. The deletion of RGS5 causes cardiac dysfunction and induces myocardial fibrosis, one of the hallmarks of cardiac ageing.\nPreliminary Insights into the Effects of Spinal Manipulation Therapy of Different Force Magnitudes on Blood Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress and Pro-Resolution of Inflammation Mediators\nAuthors: Duarte, F. C. K.; Funabashi, M.; Starmer, D.; Partata, W. A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573549\nIntroduction: Evidence has reported that spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) leads to spine segmental hypoalgesia through neurophysiological and peripheral mechanisms related to regulating inflammatory biomarker function. However, these studies also showed substantial inter-individual variability in the biomarker responses. Such variability may be due to the incomplete understanding of the fundamental effects of force-based manipulations (e.g., patient-specific force-time characteristics) on a persons physiology in health and disease. This study investigated the short-term effects of distinct SMT force-time characteristics on blood oxidative stress and pro-resolution of inflammation biomarkers. Methods: Nineteen healthy adults were clustered into three groups: control (preload only), target total peak force of 400N, and 800N. A validated force-sensing table technology (FSTT) determined the SMT force-time characteristics. Blood samples were collected at pre-intervention, immediately after SMT, and 20 minutes post-intervention. Parameters of the oxidant system (total oxidant status, lipid peroxidation and lipid hydroperoxide), the antioxidant system (total antioxidant capacity and bilirubin), and lipid-derived resolvin D1 were evaluated in plasma and erythrocytes through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and colorimetric assays. Results: Overall, 400N seemed to decrease blood oxidants, and 800N generally increased blood oxidants, decreased antioxidants and resolvin D1 mediator. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that different single SMT force-time characteristics presented contrasting effects on the systemic redox signalling biomarkers and pro-resolution of inflammation mediators in healthy participants, providing baseline information and direction for future studies in a clinical population.\nRefinement of a technique for collecting and evaluating the osmolality of haemolymph from Drosophila larvae\nAuthors: Kurio, M.; Tsukasa, Y.; Uemura, T.; Usui, T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573325\nex vivo physiological experiments using small insect models such as Drosophila larvae have become increasingly useful to address fundamental biological questions. To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination. Here, we greatly refined existing haemolymph collecting methods, evaluated the purity of the collected haemolymph under melanin-free conditions, and concluded that the true value of haemolymph osmolality is close to 306.0 mOsm kg-1 in Drosophila larvae.\nLipid peroxidation does not mediate muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency\nAuthors: Eshima, H.; Johnson, J. M.; Funai, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573082\nMechanisms by which disuse promotes skeletal muscle atrophy is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that disuse reduces the abundance of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in skeletal muscle. Deletion of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD), an enzyme that generates mitochondrial PE, was sufficient to promote muscle atrophy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deletion is driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Mice with muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) were crossed with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) transgenic mice (GPx4Tg) to suppress the accumulation of LOOH. However, PSD-MKO x GPx4Tg mice and PSD-MKO mice demonstrated equally robust loss of muscle mass. These results suggest that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency is not driven by the accumulation of LOOH.\nAugmented gut hormone response to feeding in older adults exhibiting low appetite.\nAuthors: Dagbasi, A.; Warner, J.; Catterall, V.; Crabtree, D. R.; Carroll, B.; Frost, G.; Holliday, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573652\nAge-related changes in gut hormones may play a role in anorexia of ageing. The aim of this study was to determine concentrations of ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype. Thirteen older adults with healthy appetite (OA-HA; 8f, 75{+/-}7 years, 26.0{+/-}3.2 kg{middle dot}m'2), fifteen older adults with low appetite (OA-LA; 10f, 72{+/-}7 years, 23.6{+/-}3.1 kg{middle dot}m'2), and twelve young adults (YA; 6f, 22{+/-}2 years, 24.4{+/-}2.0 kg{middle dot}m'2) completed the study. Healthy appetite and low appetite were determined based on BMI, habitual energy intake, self-reported appetite, and laboratory-assessed ad libitum lunch intake. Participants provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and blood sample (0 minutes) before consuming a standardised breakfast (450 kcal). Appetite was measured every 30 minutes for 240 minutes and blood was sampled at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. At 240 minutes, an ad libitum lunch meal was consumed. Relative energy intake at lunch (expressed as percentage of estimated total energy requirement) was lower for OA-LA (19.8{+/-}7.7%) compared with YA (41.5{+/-}9.2%, p\u003c0.001) and OA-HA (37.3{+/-}10.0%, p\u003c0.001). Ghrelin suppression was greater for OA-LA than YA at 90 minutes (-512{+/-}477 pg{middle dot}mL'1 vs. 174{+/-}182 pg{middle dot}mL'1, p=0.045) and 180 minutes (-502{+/-}147 pg{middle dot}mL'1 vs. -208{+/-}202 pg{middle dot}mL'1, p=0.049), and lower than OA-HA at 60 minutes (-447{+/-}447 pg{middle dot}mL'1 vs. -125{+/-}169 pg{middle dot}mL'1, p=0.039). GLP-1 concentration was higher for OA-LA compared with YA at 180 minutes (5.00{+/-}4.71 pM vs. 1.07{+/-}2.83 pM, p=0.040). Net AUC for PYY response to feeding was greater for OA-LA compared with OA-HA (p=0.052). No differences were seen in subjective appetite. These observations in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype suggest augmented anorexigenic responses of gut hormones to feeding may be causal mechanisms of anorexia of ageing.\nTRPM8-dependent shaking in mammals and birds\nAuthors: Selescu, T.; Bivoleanu, R.-A.; Iodi Carstens, M.; Manolache, A.; Caragea, V.-M.; Hutanu, D.-E.; Meerupally, R.; Wei, E. T.; Carstens, E.; Zimmermann, K.; Babes, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573364\nRemoving water from wet fur or feathers is important for thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals. The \"wet dog shake\" (WDS) behavior has been largely characterized in mammals but to a much lesser extent in birds. Although it is known that TRPM8 is the main molecular transducer of low temperature in mammals, it is not clear if wetness-induced shaking in furred and feathered animals is dependent on TRPM8. Here, we show that a novel TRPM8 agonist induces WDS in rodents and, importantly, in birds, similar to the shaking behavior evoked by water-spraying. Furthermore, the WDS onset depends on TRPM8, as we show in water-sprayed mice. Overall, our results provide multiple evidence for a TRPM8 dependence of WDS behaviors in all tested species. These suggest that a convergent evolution selected similar shaking behaviors to expel water from fur and feathers, with TRPM8 being involved in wetness sensing in both mammals and birds.\nProfiling cellular heterogeneity and fructose transporter expression in the rat nephron by integrating single-cell and microdissected tubule segment transcriptomes\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Jadhav, D. A.; Kramer, B. K.; Gonzalez-Vicente, A.; Kidney Precision Medicine Project, Score: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572656\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{+/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{+/-}9% S1, 58{+/-}8% S2, and 19{+/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{+/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p\u003c1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p\u003c4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.\nc-fos induction in the choroid plexus, tanycytes and pars tuberalis is an early indicator of spontaneous arousal from torpor in a deep hibernator\nAuthors: Markussen, F. A. F.; Cazarez-Marquez, F.; Melum, V. J.; Hazlerigg, D.; Wood, S. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572338\nHibernation is an extreme state of seasonal energy conservation, reducing metabolic rate to as little as 1% of the active state. During the hibernation season, many species of hibernating mammals cycle repeatedly between the active (aroused) and hibernating (torpid) states (T-A cycling), using brown adipose tissue (BAT) to drive cyclical rewarming. The regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain undefined but are presumed to involve thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus. Here, we use the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and high-resolution monitoring of BAT, core body temperature (Tb), and ventilation rate, to sample at precisely defined phases of the T-A cycle. Using c-fos as a marker of cellular activity we show that although the dorso-medial hypothalamus (DMH) is active during torpor entry, neither it nor the pre-optic area (POA) show any significant changes during the earliest stages of spontaneous arousal. Contrastingly, in 3 non-neuronal sites previously linked to control of metabolic physiology over seasonal and daily timescales, the choroid plexus (CP), pars tuberalis (PT) and third ventricle tanycytes, peak c-fos expression is seen at arousal initiation. We suggest that through their sensitivity to factors in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these sites may mediate metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process. Summary statementNon-neuronal sites linked to control of daily and seasonal metabolic physiology, peak in c-fos expression during arousal from torpor, suggesting metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.\nLight-phase prednisone promotes glucose oxidation in heart through novel transactivation targets of cardiomyocyte-specific GR and KLF15\nAuthors: El Abdellaoui-Soussi, F.; Durumutla, H. B.; Latimer, H.; Prabakaran, A. D.; McFarland, K.; Miz, K.; Piczer, K.; Werbrich, C.; Jain, M. K.; Haldar, S. M.; Quattrocelli, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572210\nCircadian time of intake determines the cardioprotective outcome of glucocorticoids in normal and infarcted hearts. The cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is genetically required to preserve normal heart function in the long-term. The GR co-factor KLF15 is a pleiotropic regulator of cardiac metabolism. However, the cardiomyocyte-autonomous metabolic targets of the GR-KLF15 concerted epigenetic action remain undefined. Here we report that circadian time of intake determines the activation of a transcriptional and functional glucose oxidation program in heart by the glucocorticoid prednisone with comparable magnitude between sexes. We overlayed transcriptomics, epigenomics and cardiomyocyte-specific inducible ablation of either GR or KLF15. Downstream of a light-phase prednisone stimulation in mice, we found that both factors are non-redundantly required in heart to transactivate the adiponectin receptor expression (Adipor1) and promote insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as transactivate the mitochondrial pyruvate complex expression (Mpc1/2) and promote pyruvate oxidation. We then challenged this time-specific drug effect in obese diabetic db/db mice, where the heart shows insulin resistance and defective glucose oxidation. Opposite to dark-phase dosing, light-phase prednisone rescued glucose oxidation in db/db cardiomyocytes and diastolic function in db/db hearts towards control-like levels with sex-independent magnitude of effect. In summary, our study identifies novel cardiomyocyte-autonomous metabolic targets of the GR-KLF15 concerted program mediating the time-specific cardioprotective effects of glucocorticoids on cardiomyocyte glucose utilization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAgeing is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Pericytes are capillary-associated mural cells involved in the maintenance and stability of the vascular network. In the heart, the consequences of ageing on cardiac pericytes are unknown.

MethodsIn this study, we have combined single nucleus RNA sequencing and histological analysis to determine the effects of ageing on cardiac pericytes. Furthermore, we have conducted in vivo and in vitro analysis of RGS5 loss of function and finally have perfomed pericytes-fibroblasts co-culture studies to understand the effect of RGS5 loss of function in pericytes on the neighbouring fibroblasts.

ResultsWe showed that ageing reduces the pericyte area and coverage. Single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis further revealed that the expression of the Regulator of G protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) is reduced in old cardiac pericytes. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that the deletion of RGS5 induces morphological changes and a pro-fibrotic gene expression signature characterized by the expression of different extracellular matrix components and growth factors like TGFB2 and PDGFB in pericytes. Indeed, the culture of fibroblasts with the supernatant of RGS5 deficient pericytes induced their activation characterized by the increased expression of  smooth muscle actin in a TFG{beta}2 dependent mechanism.

ConclusionsOur results identify RGS5 as a crucial regulator of pericyte function during cardiac ageing. The deletion of RGS5 causes cardiac dysfunction and induces myocardial fibrosis, one of the hallmarks of cardiac ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Evidence has reported that spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) leads to spine segmental hypoalgesia through neurophysiological and peripheral mechanisms related to regulating inflammatory biomarker function. However, these studies also showed substantial inter-individual variability in the biomarker responses. Such variability may be due to the incomplete understanding of the fundamental effects of force-based manipulations (e.g., patient-specific force-time characteristics) on a persons physiology in health and disease. This study investigated the short-term effects of distinct SMT force-time characteristics on blood oxidative stress and pro-resolution of inflammation biomarkers. Methods: Nineteen healthy adults were clustered into three groups: control (preload only), target total peak force of 400N, and 800N. A validated force-sensing table technology (FSTT) determined the SMT force-time characteristics. Blood samples were collected at pre-intervention, immediately after SMT, and 20 minutes post-intervention. Parameters of the oxidant system (total oxidant status, lipid peroxidation and lipid hydroperoxide), the antioxidant system (total antioxidant capacity and bilirubin), and lipid-derived resolvin D1 were evaluated in plasma and erythrocytes through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and colorimetric assays. Results: Overall, 400N seemed to decrease blood oxidants, and 800N generally increased blood oxidants, decreased antioxidants and resolvin D1 mediator. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that different single SMT force-time characteristics presented contrasting effects on the systemic redox signalling biomarkers and pro-resolution of inflammation mediators in healthy participants, providing baseline information and direction for future studies in a clinical population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ex vivo physiological experiments using small insect models such as Drosophila larvae have become increasingly useful to address fundamental biological questions. To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination. Here, we greatly refined existing haemolymph collecting methods, evaluated the purity of the collected haemolymph under melanin-free conditions, and concluded that the true value of haemolymph osmolality is close to 306.0 mOsm kg-1 in Drosophila larvae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanisms by which disuse promotes skeletal muscle atrophy is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that disuse reduces the abundance of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in skeletal muscle. Deletion of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD), an enzyme that generates mitochondrial PE, was sufficient to promote muscle atrophy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deletion is driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Mice with muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) were crossed with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) transgenic mice (GPx4Tg) to suppress the accumulation of LOOH. However, PSD-MKO x GPx4Tg mice and PSD-MKO mice demonstrated equally robust loss of muscle mass. These results suggest that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency is not driven by the accumulation of LOOH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-related changes in gut hormones may play a role in anorexia of ageing. The aim of this study was to determine concentrations of ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype. Thirteen older adults with healthy appetite (OA-HA; 8f, 75{&#43;/-}7 years, 26.0{&#43;/-}3.2 kg{middle dot}m&#39;2), fifteen older adults with low appetite (OA-LA; 10f, 72{&#43;/-}7 years, 23.6{&#43;/-}3.1 kg{middle dot}m&#39;2), and twelve young adults (YA; 6f, 22{&#43;/-}2 years, 24.4{&#43;/-}2.0 kg{middle dot}m&#39;2) completed the study. Healthy appetite and low appetite were determined based on BMI, habitual energy intake, self-reported appetite, and laboratory-assessed ad libitum lunch intake. Participants provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and blood sample (0 minutes) before consuming a standardised breakfast (450 kcal). Appetite was measured every 30 minutes for 240 minutes and blood was sampled at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. At 240 minutes, an ad libitum lunch meal was consumed. Relative energy intake at lunch (expressed as percentage of estimated total energy requirement) was lower for OA-LA (19.8{&#43;/-}7.7%) compared with YA (41.5{&#43;/-}9.2%, p&lt;0.001) and OA-HA (37.3{&#43;/-}10.0%, p&lt;0.001). Ghrelin suppression was greater for OA-LA than YA at 90 minutes (-512{&#43;/-}477 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1 vs. 174{&#43;/-}182 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1, p=0.045) and 180 minutes (-502{&#43;/-}147 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1 vs. -208{&#43;/-}202 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1, p=0.049), and lower than OA-HA at 60 minutes (-447{&#43;/-}447 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1 vs. -125{&#43;/-}169 pg{middle dot}mL&#39;1, p=0.039). GLP-1 concentration was higher for OA-LA compared with YA at 180 minutes (5.00{&#43;/-}4.71 pM vs. 1.07{&#43;/-}2.83 pM, p=0.040). Net AUC for PYY response to feeding was greater for OA-LA compared with OA-HA (p=0.052). No differences were seen in subjective appetite. These observations in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype suggest augmented anorexigenic responses of gut hormones to feeding may be causal mechanisms of anorexia of ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Removing water from wet fur or feathers is important for thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals. The &#34;wet dog shake&#34; (WDS) behavior has been largely characterized in mammals but to a much lesser extent in birds. Although it is known that TRPM8 is the main molecular transducer of low temperature in mammals, it is not clear if wetness-induced shaking in furred and feathered animals is dependent on TRPM8. Here, we show that a novel TRPM8 agonist induces WDS in rodents and, importantly, in birds, similar to the shaking behavior evoked by water-spraying. Furthermore, the WDS onset depends on TRPM8, as we show in water-sprayed mice. Overall, our results provide multiple evidence for a TRPM8 dependence of WDS behaviors in all tested species. These suggest that a convergent evolution selected similar shaking behaviors to expel water from fur and feathers, with TRPM8 being involved in wetness sensing in both mammals and birds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{&#43;/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{&#43;/-}9% S1, 58{&#43;/-}8% S2, and 19{&#43;/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{&#43;/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p&lt;1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p&lt;4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hibernation is an extreme state of seasonal energy conservation, reducing metabolic rate to as little as 1% of the active state. During the hibernation season, many species of hibernating mammals cycle repeatedly between the active (aroused) and hibernating (torpid) states (T-A cycling), using brown adipose tissue (BAT) to drive cyclical rewarming. The regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain undefined but are presumed to involve thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus. Here, we use the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and high-resolution monitoring of BAT, core body temperature (Tb), and ventilation rate, to sample at precisely defined phases of the T-A cycle. Using c-fos as a marker of cellular activity we show that although the dorso-medial hypothalamus (DMH) is active during torpor entry, neither it nor the pre-optic area (POA) show any significant changes during the earliest stages of spontaneous arousal. Contrastingly, in 3 non-neuronal sites previously linked to control of metabolic physiology over seasonal and daily timescales, the choroid plexus (CP), pars tuberalis (PT) and third ventricle tanycytes, peak c-fos expression is seen at arousal initiation. We suggest that through their sensitivity to factors in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these sites may mediate metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.

Summary statementNon-neuronal sites linked to control of daily and seasonal metabolic physiology, peak in c-fos expression during arousal from torpor, suggesting metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Circadian time of intake determines the cardioprotective outcome of glucocorticoids in normal and infarcted hearts. The cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is genetically required to preserve normal heart function in the long-term. The GR co-factor KLF15 is a pleiotropic regulator of cardiac metabolism. However, the cardiomyocyte-autonomous metabolic targets of the GR-KLF15 concerted epigenetic action remain undefined. Here we report that circadian time of intake determines the activation of a transcriptional and functional glucose oxidation program in heart by the glucocorticoid prednisone with comparable magnitude between sexes. We overlayed transcriptomics, epigenomics and cardiomyocyte-specific inducible ablation of either GR or KLF15. Downstream of a light-phase prednisone stimulation in mice, we found that both factors are non-redundantly required in heart to transactivate the adiponectin receptor expression (Adipor1) and promote insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as transactivate the mitochondrial pyruvate complex expression (Mpc1/2) and promote pyruvate oxidation. We then challenged this time-specific drug effect in obese diabetic db/db mice, where the heart shows insulin resistance and defective glucose oxidation. Opposite to dark-phase dosing, light-phase prednisone rescued glucose oxidation in db/db cardiomyocytes and diastolic function in db/db hearts towards control-like levels with sex-independent magnitude of effect. In summary, our study identifies novel cardiomyocyte-autonomous metabolic targets of the GR-KLF15 concerted program mediating the time-specific cardioprotective effects of glucocorticoids on cardiomyocyte glucose utilization.</p>
