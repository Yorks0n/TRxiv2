A.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568245\nPancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity. Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells. Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.

A.; Van de Loock, A.; Lievens, E.; Samodova, D.; Marin-Arraiza, L.; Dmytriyeva, O.; Van Vossel, K.; Yigit, N.; Anckaert, J.; Weyns, A.; Van Thienen, R.; Sahl, R. E.; Zanoteli, E.; Wierer, M.; Mestdagh, P.; Lawlor, M. W.; Vandesompele, J.; Ochala, J.; Hostrup, M.; Derave, W.; Deshmukh, A. S.\nScore: 62.1, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.\nMicrobiota-dependent early life programming of gastrointestinal motility\nAuthors: Frith, M. E.; Kashyap, P. C.; Linden, D. R.; Theriault, B.; Chang, E. B.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566304\nGastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.\nFibre-specific mitochondrial protein abundance is linked to resting and post-training mitochondrial content in human muscle.\nAuthors: Reisman, E.; Botella Ruiz, J.; Huang, C.; Schittenhelm, R. B.; Stroud, D. A.; Granata, C.; Chandrasiri, S.; Ramm, G.; Oorschot, V.; Caruana, N. J.; Bishop, D. J.\nScore: 37.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.23.512956\nAnalyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.\nEccentric exercise is not equal to eccentric contraction\nAuthors: Tecchio, P.; Raiteri, B. J.; Hahn, D.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568422\nWhether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9 - 23.2 mm, p [\u0026le;] 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre-activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise. New \u0026 NoteworthyApparent eccentric exercises do not result in isolated eccentric contractions, but shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level. The amount of fascicle shortening and stretch depend on the pre-activation during the exercise and cannot be estimated from the muscle-tendon unit or joint kinematics. As different fascicle mechanics might trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, muscle-tendon unit series elasticity and muscle pre-activation need to be considered when eccentric exercise protocols and designed and evaluated.\nDrosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling reveals age related loss of intestinal amino acid transport regulates longevity\nAuthors: Mornement, A. A.; Dack, R. E.; Doupe, D. P.; Clark, R. I.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564159\nAge-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies. In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies. Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.\nLoss of cardiac PFKFB2 drives Metabolic, Functional, and Electrophysiological Remodeling in the Heart\nAuthors: Harold, K. M.; Matsuzaki, S.; Pranay, A.; Loveland, B. L.; Batushansky, A.; Mendez Garcia, M. F.; Eyster, C. A.; Stavrakis, S.; Chiao, Y. A.; Kinter, M.; Humphries, K. M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568379\nBackgroundPhosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) is a critical glycolytic regulator responsible for upregulation of glycolysis in response to insulin and adrenergic signaling. PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of PFK-2, is degraded in the heart in the absence of insulin signaling, contributing to diabetes-induced cardiac metabolic inflexibility. However, previous studies have not examined how the loss of PFKFB2 affects global cardiac metabolism and function. MethodsTo address this, we have generated a mouse model with a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of PFKFB2 (cKO). Using 9-month-old cKO and control (CON) mice, we characterized impacts of PFKFB2 on cardiac metabolism, function, and electrophysiology. ResultscKO mice have a shortened lifespan of 9 months. Metabolically, cKO mice are characterized by increased glycolytic enzyme abundance and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, as well as decreased mitochondrial abundance and beta oxidation, suggesting a shift toward glucose metabolism. This was supported by a decrease in the ratio of palmitoyl carnitine to pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration in cKO relative to CON animals. Metabolomic, proteomic, and western blot data support the activation of ancillary glucose metabolism, including pentose phosphate and hexosamine biosynthesis pathways. Physiologically, cKO animals exhibited impaired systolic function and left ventricular (LV) dilation, represented by reduced fractional shortening and increased LV internal diameter, respectively. This was accompanied by electrophysiological alterations including increased QT interval and other metrics of delayed ventricular conduction. ConclusionsLoss of PFKFB2 results in metabolic remodeling marked by cardiac ancillary pathway activation. This could delineate an underpinning of pathologic changes to mechanical and electrical function in the heart. Clinical Perspective What is New?O_LIWe have generated a novel cardiomyocyte-specific knockout model of PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of the primary glycolytic regulator Phosphofructokinase-2 (cKO). C_LIO_LIThe cKO model demonstrates that loss of cardiac PFKFB2 drives metabolic reprogramming and shunting of glucose metabolites to ancillary metabolic pathways. C_LIO_LIThe loss of cardiac PFKFB2 promotes electrophysiological and functional remodeling in the cKO heart. C_LI What are the Clinical Implications?O_LIPFKFB2 is degraded in the absence of insulin signaling, making its loss particularly relevant to diabetes and the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy. C_LIO_LIChanges which we observe in the cKO model are consistent with those often observed in diabetes and heart failure of other etiologies. C_LIO_LIDefining PFKFB2 loss as a driver of cardiac pathogenesis identifies it as a target for future investigation and potential therapeutic intervention.

W.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566044\nThe population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.\nAge-related structural and functional changes of the intracardiac nervous system\nAuthors: Hortells, L.; Zgierski-Johnston, C. M.; Kohl, P.; Schneider-Warme, F.; Ravens, U.; Preissl, S.; Cameron, B. A.; Koch, M.; Brennan, T. A.; Madl, J.; Iaconianni, P.; Fernandez, M. C.; Stefanovska, D.; Tumlinson, G.; Sassu, E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568538\nBackgroundAlthough aging is known to be associated with an increased incidence of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, there is limited knowledge about how Schwann cells (SC) and the intracardiac nervous system (iCNS) remodel with age. Here we investigate the differences in cardiac SC, parasympathetic nerve fibers, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) expression in young and old mice. Additionally, we examine age-related changes in cardiac responses to sympathomimetic and parasympathomimetic drugs. Methods and ResultsLower SC density, lower SC proliferation and fewer parasympathetic nerve fibers were observed in cardiac and, as a control sciatic nerves from old (20-24 months) compared to young mice (2-3 months). In old mice, CSPG4 was increased in sciatic but not cardiac nerves. Expression of M2R was lower in ventricular myocardium and ventricular conduction system from old mice compared to young mice, while no significant difference was seen in M2R expression in sino-atrial or atrio-ventricular node pacemaker tissue. Heart rate was slower and PQ intervals were longer in Langendorff-perfused hearts from old mice. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were more frequently observed in response to carbachol administration in hearts from old mice versus those from young mice. ConclusionsOn the background of reduced presence of SC and parasympathetic nerve fibers, and of lower M2R expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes and conduction system of aged hearts, the propensity of ventricular arrhythmogenesis upon parasympathomimetic drug application is increased. Whether this is caused by an increase in heterogeneity of iCNS structure and function remains to be elucidated.

O. C.; Farber, S. A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567840\nEven though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity.

Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells.

Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Analyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9 - 23.2 mm, p [&amp;le;] 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre-activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise.

New &amp; NoteworthyApparent eccentric exercises do not result in isolated eccentric contractions, but shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level. The amount of fascicle shortening and stretch depend on the pre-activation during the exercise and cannot be estimated from the muscle-tendon unit or joint kinematics. As different fascicle mechanics might trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, muscle-tendon unit series elasticity and muscle pre-activation need to be considered when eccentric exercise protocols and designed and evaluated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies.

In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies.

Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPhosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) is a critical glycolytic regulator responsible for upregulation of glycolysis in response to insulin and adrenergic signaling. PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of PFK-2, is degraded in the heart in the absence of insulin signaling, contributing to diabetes-induced cardiac metabolic inflexibility. However, previous studies have not examined how the loss of PFKFB2 affects global cardiac metabolism and function.

MethodsTo address this, we have generated a mouse model with a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of PFKFB2 (cKO). Using 9-month-old cKO and control (CON) mice, we characterized impacts of PFKFB2 on cardiac metabolism, function, and electrophysiology.

ResultscKO mice have a shortened lifespan of 9 months. Metabolically, cKO mice are characterized by increased glycolytic enzyme abundance and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, as well as decreased mitochondrial abundance and beta oxidation, suggesting a shift toward glucose metabolism. This was supported by a decrease in the ratio of palmitoyl carnitine to pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration in cKO relative to CON animals. Metabolomic, proteomic, and western blot data support the activation of ancillary glucose metabolism, including pentose phosphate and hexosamine biosynthesis pathways. Physiologically, cKO animals exhibited impaired systolic function and left ventricular (LV) dilation, represented by reduced fractional shortening and increased LV internal diameter, respectively. This was accompanied by electrophysiological alterations including increased QT interval and other metrics of delayed ventricular conduction.

ConclusionsLoss of PFKFB2 results in metabolic remodeling marked by cardiac ancillary pathway activation. This could delineate an underpinning of pathologic changes to mechanical and electrical function in the heart.

Clinical Perspective What is New?O_LIWe have generated a novel cardiomyocyte-specific knockout model of PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of the primary glycolytic regulator Phosphofructokinase-2 (cKO).
C_LIO_LIThe cKO model demonstrates that loss of cardiac PFKFB2 drives metabolic reprogramming and shunting of glucose metabolites to ancillary metabolic pathways.
C_LIO_LIThe loss of cardiac PFKFB2 promotes electrophysiological and functional remodeling in the cKO heart.
C_LI

What are the Clinical Implications?O_LIPFKFB2 is degraded in the absence of insulin signaling, making its loss particularly relevant to diabetes and the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
C_LIO_LIChanges which we observe in the cKO model are consistent with those often observed in diabetes and heart failure of other etiologies.

        <p class="abstract">The population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlthough aging is known to be associated with an increased incidence of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, there is limited knowledge about how Schwann cells (SC) and the intracardiac nervous system (iCNS) remodel with age. Here we investigate the differences in cardiac SC, parasympathetic nerve fibers, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) expression in young and old mice. Additionally, we examine age-related changes in cardiac responses to sympathomimetic and parasympathomimetic drugs.

Methods and ResultsLower SC density, lower SC proliferation and fewer parasympathetic nerve fibers were observed in cardiac and, as a control sciatic nerves from old (20-24 months) compared to young mice (2-3 months). In old mice, CSPG4 was increased in sciatic but not cardiac nerves. Expression of M2R was lower in ventricular myocardium and ventricular conduction system from old mice compared to young mice, while no significant difference was seen in M2R expression in sino-atrial or atrio-ventricular node pacemaker tissue. Heart rate was slower and PQ intervals were longer in Langendorff-perfused hearts from old mice. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were more frequently observed in response to carbachol administration in hearts from old mice versus those from young mice.

ConclusionsOn the background of reduced presence of SC and parasympathetic nerve fibers, and of lower M2R expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes and conduction system of aged hearts, the propensity of ventricular arrhythmogenesis upon parasympathomimetic drug application is increased. Whether this is caused by an increase in heterogeneity of iCNS structure and function remains to be elucidated.

        <p class="abstract">Even though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.</p>
