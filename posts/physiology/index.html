D.\nScore: 77.6, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nAged male and female Panx3 KO mice develop severe osteoarthritis independent of forced mechanical use.\nAuthors: Wakefield, B.; Hutchinson, J. L.; Kanji, R.; Herold, G.; Tang, J.; O'Donnell, B. L.; Brooks, C.; Kiser, P.; Grol, M.; Seguin, C. A.; Beier, F.; Penuela, S.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547676\nBackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a multi-factorial disease that is strongly associated with aging. As the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of this disease are partially unclear, there are no disease-modifying drugs to combat OA. The mechanosensitive channel Pannexin 3 (PANX3) has been shown to promote cartilage loss during posttraumatic OA. In contrast, the ablation of Panx3 in male mice results in spontaneous full-thickness cartilage lesions at 24 months of age. Additionally, while protected from traumatic intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, Panx3 knockout (KO) mice show signs of IVD disease with altered disc mechanics. Whether the deleterious effects of ablating Panx3 in aging is the result from accumulated mechanical damage is unknown. MethodsMale and female wildtype (WT) and global Panx3 KO C57Bl6 mice were aged to 18 months of age. Mice were then randomized to sedentary (SED) or forced treadmill running (FEX) for 6 weeks (N = 5-14). Knee joint tissues including patellar tendon, quadriceps and distal patellar enthesis, and synovium were analyzed histologically, along with lumbar spine IVDs. ResultsApproximately half of male and female Panx3 KO mice developed full-thickness cartilage lesions, severe synovitis, and ectopic fibrocartilage deposition and calcification of the knee joints. Additionally, Panx3 KO mice with severe OA show signs of quadriceps and patellar enthesitis, characterized by bone and marrow formation. Forced treadmill running did not seem to exacerbate these phenotypes in male or female Panx3 KO mice; however, it may have contributed to the development of lateral compartment OA. The IVDs of aged Panx3 KO mice displayed no apparent differences to control mice, and forced treadmill running had no overt effects in either genotype. ConclusionAged Panx3 KO mice show histological features of late-stage primary OA including full-thickness cartilage erosion, subchondral bone thickening, and severe synovitis. This data suggests the deletion of Panx3 is deleterious to synovial joint health in aging.\nβ-hydroxybutyrate is a metabolic regulator of proteostasis in the aged and Alzheimer disease brain\nAuthors: Madhavan, S. S.; Roa Diaz, S.; Peralta, S.; Nomura, M.; King, C. D.; Lin, A.; Bhaumik, D.; Shah, S.; Blade, T.; Gray, W.; Chamoli, M.; Eap, B.; Panda, O.; Diaz, D.; Garcia, T. Y.; Stubbs, B. J.; Lithgow, G. J.; Schilling, B.; Verdin, E.; Chaudhuri, A.; Newman, J. C.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547547\nLoss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.\nLabile assembly of a tardigrade protein induces biostasis\nAuthors: Sanchez-Martinez, S.; Nguyen, K.; Biswas, S.; Nicholson, V.; Romanyuk, A.

W.; Caporaletti, F.; Giubertoni, G.; Woutersen, S.; Sukenik, S.; Woolfson, D.; Holehouse, A. S.; Boothby, T. C.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547219\nTardigrades are microscopic animals that survive desiccation by inducing biostasis. To survive drying tardigrades rely on intrinsically disordered CAHS proteins that form gels. However, the sequence features and mechanisms underlying gel formation and the necessity of gelation for protection have not been demonstrated. Here we report a mechanism of gelation for CAHS D similar to that of intermediate filaments. We show that gelation restricts molecular motion, immobilizing and protecting labile material from the harmful effects of drying. In vivo, we observe that CAHS D forms fiber-like condensates during osmotic stress. Condensation of CAHS D improves survival of osmotically shocked cells through at least two mechanisms: reduction of cell volume change and reduction of metabolic activity. Importantly, condensation of CAHS D is reversible and metabolic rates return to control levels after CAHS condensates are resolved. This work provides insights into how tardigrades induce biostasis through the self-assembly of CAHS gels.\nFibroblast growth factor-21 induces skeletal muscle atrophy and increases plasma amino acids in female mice: a potential role for glucocorticoids\nAuthors: Larson, K. R.; Jayakrishnan, D.; Soto Sauza, K.; Goodson, M. L.; Chaffin, A. T.; Davidyan, A.; Pathak, S.; Fang, Y.; Gonzalez Magana, D.; Miller, B. F.; Ryan, K. K.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546599\nBackgroundFibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is an intercellular signaling molecule secreted by metabolic organs, including skeletal muscle, in response to intracellular stress. FGF21 crosses the blood brain barrier and acts via the nervous system to coordinate aspects of the adaptive starvation response, including increased lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, hepatic fatty acid oxidation, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Given its beneficial effects for hepatic lipid metabolism, pharmaceutical FGF21 analogues are in clinical trials treatment of fatty liver disease. We predicted pharmacologic treatment with FGF21 in-creases HPA axis activity and skeletal muscle glucocorticoid signaling and induces skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. MethodsWe treated male and female mice with FGF21 or saline, delivered either pe-ripherally or directly to the brain, to determine its effect on skeletal muscle. To identify metabolic pathways affected by FGF21, we analyzed untargeted primary metabolites measured in plasma by GCTOF-MS. To determine mechanisms underlying sex-and FGF21-dependent changes in muscle mass, we measured hormonal and molecular mediators of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. We performed stable isotope labeling with deuterium oxide to directly measure muscle protein synthesis. ResultsA short course of systemic FGF21 treatment decreased muscle protein synthe-sis (P \u003c 0.001) and reduced tibialis anterior weight (P \u003c 0.05); this was driven primarily by its effect in female mice (P \u003c 0.05). Similarly, intracerebroventricular FGF21 reduced TA muscle fiber cross sectional area (P \u003c 0.01); this was more apparent among female mice compared to male littermates (P \u003c 0.05). In agreement with the reduced muscle mass, the topmost enriched meta-bolic pathways in FGF21-treated females were related to amino acid metabolism, and the relative abundance of plasma proteinogenic amino acids were increased up to three-fold (P \u003c 0.05). FGF21 treatment increased hypothalamic Crh mRNA (P \u003c 0.01), plasma corticosterone (P \u003c 0.01), and adrenal weight (P \u003c 0.05), and increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor target genes known to reduce muscle protein synthesis and/or promote degradation including Foxo1, Redd1, and Klf15 (P \u003c 0.05). Again, these changes were driven primarily by effects of FGF21 in females (P \u003c 0.05). ConclusionsFGF21 increased plasma amino acids and decreased skeletal muscle mass, together with activation of the HPA axis and glucocorticoid receptor target genes in skeletal muscle--and female mice were more sensitive to all these outcomes. Given the proposed use of FGF21 analogues for the treatment of metabolic disease, the study is both physiologically relevant and may have important clinical implications.\nA Novel Drosophila Model to Investigate Adipose Tissue Macrophage Infiltration (ATM) and Obesity highlights the Therapeutic Potential of Attenuating Eiger/TNF Signaling to Ameliorate Insulin Resistance and ATM.\nAuthors: Mirzoyan, Z.; Valenza, A. M.; Zola, S.; Bonfanti, C.; Arnaboldi, L.; Ferrari, N.; Pollard, J.; Lupi, V.; Cassinelli, M.; Frattaroli, M.; Sahin, M.; Pasini, M. E.; Bellosta, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548016\nObesity is a global health concern associated with various metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation characterized by adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration. In this study, we present a novel Drosophila model to investigate the mechanisms underlying ATM infiltration and its association with obesity-related pathologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of attenuating Eiger/TNF signaling to ameliorate insulin resistance and ATM. To study ATM infiltration and its consequences, we established a novel Drosophila model (OBL) that mimics key aspects of human adipose tissue and allows for investigating ATM infiltration and other related metabolic disorders in a controlled experimental system. We employed genetic manipulation to reduce ecdysone levels to prolong the larval stage. These animals are hyperphagic, and exhibit features resembling obesity in mammals, including increased lipid storage, adipocyte hypertrophy, and high levels of circulating glucose. Moreover, we observed a significant infiltration of immune cells (hemocytes) in the fat bodies accompanied by insulin resistance and systemic metabolic dysregulation. Furthermore, we found that attenuation of Eiger/TNF signaling and using metformin and anti-oxidant bio-products like anthocyanins led to a reduction in ATM infiltration and improved insulin sensitivity. Our data suggest that the key mechanisms that trigger immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue are evolutionarily conserved and may provide the opportunity to develop Drosophila models to better understand pathways critical for immune cell recruitment into adipose tissue, in relation to the development of insulin resistance in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We believe that our OBL model can also be a valuable tool and provide a platform either to perform genetic screens or to test the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions for these diseases.\nIn vivo characterization of the optical and hemodynamic properties of the human sternocleidomastoid muscle through ultrasound-guided hybrid near-infrared spectroscopies.\nAuthors: Cortese, L.; Fenandez Esteberena, P.; Zanoletti, M.; Lo Presti, G.; Aranda Velazquez, G.; Ruiz Janer, S.; Buttafava, M.; Renna, M.; Di Sieno, L.; Tosi, A.; Dalla Mora, A.; Dehghani, H.; Wojtkiewicz, S.; de Fraguier, S.; Nguyen-Dinh, A.; Rosinski, B.; Weigel, U. M.; Mesquida, J.; Squarcia, M.; Hanzu, F. A.; Contini, D.; Mora Porta, M.; Durduran, T.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.544760\nThe non-invasive monitoring of the hemodynamics and metabolism of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) during respiration became a topic of increased interest partially due to the increased use of mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopies were proposed as potential practical monitors of increased recruitment of SCM during respiratory distress. They can provide clinically relevant information on the degree of the patients respiratory effort that is needed to maintain an optimal minute ventilation, with potential clinical application ranging from evaluating chronic pulmonary diseases to more acute settings, such as acute respiratory failure, or to determine the readiness to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation. In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of the optical properties (wave-length dependent absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and hemodynamic properties (oxy-, deoxy- and total hemoglobin concentrations, blood flow, blood oxygen saturation and metabolic rate of oxygen extraction) of the human SCM, obtained by measuring sixty-five subjects through ultrasound-guided near-infrared time-resolved and diffuse correlation spectroscopies. We provide detailed tables of the results related to SCM baseline (i.e. muscle at rest) properties, and reveal significant differences on the measured parameters due to variables such as side of the neck, sex, age, body mass index and thickness of the overlaying tissues, allowing future clinical studies to take into account such dependencies.\nDual effects of the small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ current on human atrial electrophysiology and Ca2+-driven arrhythmogenesis: an in silico study\nAuthors: Herrera, N. T.; Zhang, X.; Ni, H.; Maleckar, M. M.; Heijman, J.; Dobrev, D.; Grandi, E.; Morotti, S.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-06-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545367\nBy sensing changes in intracellular Ca2+, small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels dynamically regulate the dynamics of the cardiac action potential (AP) on a beat-to-beat basis. Given their predominance in atria vs. ventricles, SK channels are considered a promising atrial-selective pharmacological target against atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. However, the precise contribution of SK current (ISK) to atrial arrhythmogenesis is poorly understood, and may potentially involve different mechanisms that depend on species, heart rates, and degree of AF-induced atrial remodeling. Both reduced and enhanced ISK have been linked to AF. Similarly, both SK channel up- and downregulation have been reported in chronic AF (cAF) vs. normal sinus rhythm (nSR) patient samples. Here, we use our multi-scale modeling framework to obtain mechanistic insights into the contribution of ISK in human atrial myocyte electrophysiology. We simulate several protocols to quantify how ISK modulation affects the regulation of AP duration (APD), Ca2+ transient, refractoriness, and occurrence of alternans and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). Our simulations show that ISK activation shortens the APD and atrial effective refractory period, limits Ca2+ cycling, and slightly increases the propensity for alternans in both nSR and cAF conditions. We also show that increasing ISK counteracts DAD development by reducing the coupling between transmembrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing ISK in human atrial myocytes could promote reentry, while protecting against triggered activity. Depending on the leading arrhythmogenic mechanism, ISK inhibition may thus be a beneficial or detrimental anti-AF strategy.\nAster-dependent non-vesicular transport facilitates dietary cholesterol uptake\nAuthors: Ferrari, A.; Whang, E.; Xiao, X.; Kennelly, J. P.; Romartinez- Alonso, B.; Mack, J. J.; Weston, T.; Chen, K.; Kim, Y.; Tol, M.; Bideyan, L.; Nguyen, A.; Gao, Y.; Cui, L.; Bedard, A. H.; Sandhu, J.; Lee, S. D.; Fairall, L.; Williams, K. J.; Song, W.; Munguia, P.; Russell, R. A.; Martin, M. G.; Jung, M. E.; Jiang, H.; Schwabe, J. W.; Young, S. G.; Tontonoz, P.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548168\nIntestinal cholesterol absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.\nA novel deep proteomic approach in human skeletal muscle unveils distinct molecular signatures affected by aging and resistance training\nAuthors: Roberts, M.; Ruple, B.; Godwin, J.; McIntosh, M.; Chen, S.-Y.; Kontos, N.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Michel, J. M.; Plotkin, D.; Mattingly, M.; Mobley, C. B.; Ziegenfuss, T.; Fruge, A.; Kavazis, A.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543459\nWe examined the myofibrillar (MyoF) and non-myofibrillar (non-MyoF) proteomic profiles of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of younger (Y, 22{+/-}2 years old; n=5) and middle-aged participants (MA, 56{+/-}8 years old; n=6), and MA following eight weeks of knee extensor resistance training (RT, 2d/week). Shotgun/bottom-up proteomics in skeletal muscle typically yields wide protein abundance ranges that mask lowly expressed proteins. Thus, we adopted a novel approach whereby the MyoF and non-MyoF fractions were separately subjected to protein corona nanoparticle complex formation prior to digestion and Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. A total of 10,866 proteins (4,421 MyoF and 6,445 non-MyoF) were identified. Across all participants, the number of non-MyoF proteins detected averaged to be 5,645{+/-}266 (range: 4,888-5,987) and the number of MyoF proteins detected averaged to be 2,611{+/-}326 (range: 1,944-3,101). Differences in the non-MyoF (8.4%) and MyoF (2.5%) proteome were evident between age cohorts. Further, most of these age-related non-MyoF proteins (447/543) were more enriched in MA versus Y. Several biological processes in the non-MyoF fraction were predicted to be operative in MA versus Y including (but not limited to) increased cellular stress, mRNA splicing, translation elongation, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Non-MyoF proteins associated with splicing and proteostasis were further interrogated, and in agreement with bioinformatics, alternative protein variants, spliceosome-associated proteins (snRNPs), and proteolysis-related targets were more abundant in MA versus Y. RT in MA non-significantly increased VL muscle cross-sectional area (+6.5%, p=0.066) and significantly increased knee extensor strength (+8.7%, p=0.048). However, RT modestly altered the MyoF ([~]0.3%, 11 upregulated and two downregulated proteins) and non-MyoF proteomes ([~]1.0%, 56 upregulated and eight downregulated proteins, p\u003c0.01). Further, RT did not affect predicted biological processes in either fraction. Although participant numbers were limited, these preliminary results using a novel deep proteomic approach in skeletal muscle suggest that aging and RT predominantly affects protein abundances in the non-contractile protein pool. However, the marginal proteome adaptations occurring with RT suggest either: a) this may be an aging-associated phenomenon, b) more rigorous RT may stimulate more robust effects, or c) RT, regardless of age, subtly affects skeletal muscle protein abundances in the basal state.\n",

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a multi-factorial disease that is strongly associated with aging. As the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of this disease are partially unclear, there are no disease-modifying drugs to combat OA. The mechanosensitive channel Pannexin 3 (PANX3) has been shown to promote cartilage loss during posttraumatic OA. In contrast, the ablation of Panx3 in male mice results in spontaneous full-thickness cartilage lesions at 24 months of age. Additionally, while protected from traumatic intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, Panx3 knockout (KO) mice show signs of IVD disease with altered disc mechanics. Whether the deleterious effects of ablating Panx3 in aging is the result from accumulated mechanical damage is unknown.

MethodsMale and female wildtype (WT) and global Panx3 KO C57Bl6 mice were aged to 18 months of age. Mice were then randomized to sedentary (SED) or forced treadmill running (FEX) for 6 weeks (N = 5-14). Knee joint tissues including patellar tendon, quadriceps and distal patellar enthesis, and synovium were analyzed histologically, along with lumbar spine IVDs.

ResultsApproximately half of male and female Panx3 KO mice developed full-thickness cartilage lesions, severe synovitis, and ectopic fibrocartilage deposition and calcification of the knee joints. Additionally, Panx3 KO mice with severe OA show signs of quadriceps and patellar enthesitis, characterized by bone and marrow formation. Forced treadmill running did not seem to exacerbate these phenotypes in male or female Panx3 KO mice; however, it may have contributed to the development of lateral compartment OA. The IVDs of aged Panx3 KO mice displayed no apparent differences to control mice, and forced treadmill running had no overt effects in either genotype.

ConclusionAged Panx3 KO mice show histological features of late-stage primary OA including full-thickness cartilage erosion, subchondral bone thickening, and severe synovitis. This data suggests the deletion of Panx3 is deleterious to synovial joint health in aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive desiccation by inducing biostasis. To survive drying tardigrades rely on intrinsically disordered CAHS proteins that form gels. However, the sequence features and mechanisms underlying gel formation and the necessity of gelation for protection have not been demonstrated. Here we report a mechanism of gelation for CAHS D similar to that of intermediate filaments. We show that gelation restricts molecular motion, immobilizing and protecting labile material from the harmful effects of drying. In vivo, we observe that CAHS D forms fiber-like condensates during osmotic stress. Condensation of CAHS D improves survival of osmotically shocked cells through at least two mechanisms: reduction of cell volume change and reduction of metabolic activity. Importantly, condensation of CAHS D is reversible and metabolic rates return to control levels after CAHS condensates are resolved. This work provides insights into how tardigrades induce biostasis through the self-assembly of CAHS gels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is an intercellular signaling molecule secreted by metabolic organs, including skeletal muscle, in response to intracellular stress. FGF21 crosses the blood brain barrier and acts via the nervous system to coordinate aspects of the adaptive starvation response, including increased lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, hepatic fatty acid oxidation, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Given its beneficial effects for hepatic lipid metabolism, pharmaceutical FGF21 analogues are in clinical trials treatment of fatty liver disease. We predicted pharmacologic treatment with FGF21 in-creases HPA axis activity and skeletal muscle glucocorticoid signaling and induces skeletal muscle atrophy in mice.

MethodsWe treated male and female mice with FGF21 or saline, delivered either pe-ripherally or directly to the brain, to determine its effect on skeletal muscle. To identify metabolic pathways affected by FGF21, we analyzed untargeted primary metabolites measured in plasma by GCTOF-MS. To determine mechanisms underlying sex-and FGF21-dependent changes in muscle mass, we measured hormonal and molecular mediators of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. We performed stable isotope labeling with deuterium oxide to directly measure muscle protein synthesis.

ResultsA short course of systemic FGF21 treatment decreased muscle protein synthe-sis (P &lt; 0.001) and reduced tibialis anterior weight (P &lt; 0.05); this was driven primarily by its effect in female mice (P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, intracerebroventricular FGF21 reduced TA muscle fiber cross sectional area (P &lt; 0.01); this was more apparent among female mice compared to male littermates (P &lt; 0.05). In agreement with the reduced muscle mass, the topmost enriched meta-bolic pathways in FGF21-treated females were related to amino acid metabolism, and the relative abundance of plasma proteinogenic amino acids were increased up to three-fold (P &lt; 0.05). FGF21 treatment increased hypothalamic Crh mRNA (P &lt; 0.01), plasma corticosterone (P &lt; 0.01), and adrenal weight (P &lt; 0.05), and increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor target genes known to reduce muscle protein synthesis and/or promote degradation including Foxo1, Redd1, and Klf15 (P &lt; 0.05). Again, these changes were driven primarily by effects of FGF21 in females (P &lt; 0.05).

ConclusionsFGF21 increased plasma amino acids and decreased skeletal muscle mass, together with activation of the HPA axis and glucocorticoid receptor target genes in skeletal muscle--and female mice were more sensitive to all these outcomes. Given the proposed use of FGF21 analogues for the treatment of metabolic disease, the study is both physiologically relevant and may have important clinical implications.</p>

To study ATM infiltration and its consequences, we established a novel Drosophila model (OBL) that mimics key aspects of human adipose tissue and allows for investigating ATM infiltration and other related metabolic disorders in a controlled experimental system. We employed genetic manipulation to reduce ecdysone levels to prolong the larval stage. These animals are hyperphagic, and exhibit features resembling obesity in mammals, including increased lipid storage, adipocyte hypertrophy, and high levels of circulating glucose. Moreover, we observed a significant infiltration of immune cells (hemocytes) in the fat bodies accompanied by insulin resistance and systemic metabolic dysregulation. Furthermore, we found that attenuation of Eiger/TNF signaling and using metformin and anti-oxidant bio-products like anthocyanins led to a reduction in ATM infiltration and improved insulin sensitivity. Our data suggest that the key mechanisms that trigger immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue are evolutionarily conserved and may provide the opportunity to develop Drosophila models to better understand pathways critical for immune cell recruitment into adipose tissue, in relation to the development of insulin resistance in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We believe that our OBL model can also be a valuable tool and provide a platform either to perform genetic screens or to test the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions for these diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The non-invasive monitoring of the hemodynamics and metabolism of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) during respiration became a topic of increased interest partially due to the increased use of mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopies were proposed as potential practical monitors of increased recruitment of SCM during respiratory distress. They can provide clinically relevant information on the degree of the patients respiratory effort that is needed to maintain an optimal minute ventilation, with potential clinical application ranging from evaluating chronic pulmonary diseases to more acute settings, such as acute respiratory failure, or to determine the readiness to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation.

In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of the optical properties (wave-length dependent absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and hemodynamic properties (oxy-, deoxy- and total hemoglobin concentrations, blood flow, blood oxygen saturation and metabolic rate of oxygen extraction) of the human SCM, obtained by measuring sixty-five subjects through ultrasound-guided near-infrared time-resolved and diffuse correlation spectroscopies.

We provide detailed tables of the results related to SCM baseline (i.e. muscle at rest) properties, and reveal significant differences on the measured parameters due to variables such as side of the neck, sex, age, body mass index and thickness of the overlaying tissues, allowing future clinical studies to take into account such dependencies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">By sensing changes in intracellular Ca2&#43;, small-conductance Ca2&#43;-activated K&#43; (SK) channels dynamically regulate the dynamics of the cardiac action potential (AP) on a beat-to-beat basis. Given their predominance in atria vs. ventricles, SK channels are considered a promising atrial-selective pharmacological target against atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. However, the precise contribution of SK current (ISK) to atrial arrhythmogenesis is poorly understood, and may potentially involve different mechanisms that depend on species, heart rates, and degree of AF-induced atrial remodeling. Both reduced and enhanced ISK have been linked to AF. Similarly, both SK channel up- and downregulation have been reported in chronic AF (cAF) vs. normal sinus rhythm (nSR) patient samples. Here, we use our multi-scale modeling framework to obtain mechanistic insights into the contribution of ISK in human atrial myocyte electrophysiology. We simulate several protocols to quantify how ISK modulation affects the regulation of AP duration (APD), Ca2&#43; transient, refractoriness, and occurrence of alternans and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). Our simulations show that ISK activation shortens the APD and atrial effective refractory period, limits Ca2&#43; cycling, and slightly increases the propensity for alternans in both nSR and cAF conditions. We also show that increasing ISK counteracts DAD development by reducing the coupling between transmembrane potential and intracellular Ca2&#43;. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing ISK in human atrial myocytes could promote reentry, while protecting against triggered activity. Depending on the leading arrhythmogenic mechanism, ISK inhibition may thus be a beneficial or detrimental anti-AF strategy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We examined the myofibrillar (MyoF) and non-myofibrillar (non-MyoF) proteomic profiles of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of younger (Y, 22{&#43;/-}2 years old; n=5) and middle-aged participants (MA, 56{&#43;/-}8 years old; n=6), and MA following eight weeks of knee extensor resistance training (RT, 2d/week). Shotgun/bottom-up proteomics in skeletal muscle typically yields wide protein abundance ranges that mask lowly expressed proteins. Thus, we adopted a novel approach whereby the MyoF and non-MyoF fractions were separately subjected to protein corona nanoparticle complex formation prior to digestion and Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. A total of 10,866 proteins (4,421 MyoF and 6,445 non-MyoF) were identified. Across all participants, the number of non-MyoF proteins detected averaged to be 5,645{&#43;/-}266 (range: 4,888-5,987) and the number of MyoF proteins detected averaged to be 2,611{&#43;/-}326 (range: 1,944-3,101). Differences in the non-MyoF (8.4%) and MyoF (2.5%) proteome were evident between age cohorts. Further, most of these age-related non-MyoF proteins (447/543) were more enriched in MA versus Y. Several biological processes in the non-MyoF fraction were predicted to be operative in MA versus Y including (but not limited to) increased cellular stress, mRNA splicing, translation elongation, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Non-MyoF proteins associated with splicing and proteostasis were further interrogated, and in agreement with bioinformatics, alternative protein variants, spliceosome-associated proteins (snRNPs), and proteolysis-related targets were more abundant in MA versus Y. RT in MA non-significantly increased VL muscle cross-sectional area (&#43;6.5%, p=0.066) and significantly increased knee extensor strength (&#43;8.7%, p=0.048). However, RT modestly altered the MyoF ([~]0.3%, 11 upregulated and two downregulated proteins) and non-MyoF proteomes ([~]1.0%, 56 upregulated and eight downregulated proteins, p&lt;0.01). Further, RT did not affect predicted biological processes in either fraction. Although participant numbers were limited, these preliminary results using a novel deep proteomic approach in skeletal muscle suggest that aging and RT predominantly affects protein abundances in the non-contractile protein pool. However, the marginal proteome adaptations occurring with RT suggest either: a) this may be an aging-associated phenomenon, b) more rigorous RT may stimulate more robust effects, or c) RT, regardless of age, subtly affects skeletal muscle protein abundances in the basal state.</p>
