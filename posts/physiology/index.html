A.; McReynolds, M.; Glancy, B.; Hinton, A.\nScore: 23.5, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569095\nThis study, utilizing SBF-SEM, reveals structural alterations in mitochondria and myofibrils in human heart failure (HF). Mitochondria in HF show changes in structure, while myofibrils exhibit increased cross-sectional area and branching. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses indicate concomitant dysregulation in key pathways. The findings underscore the need for personalized treatments considering individualized structural changes in HF.\nBone quality following peripubertal growth in a mouse model of transmasculine gender-affirming hormone therapy\nAuthors: Henry, B.; Dela Cruz, C.; Goulet, R. W.; Nolan, B. T.; Locke, C.; Padmanabhan, V.; Moravec, M.; Shikanov, A.; Killian, M. L.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570840\nDuring peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa + T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender youth.\nProfiling cellular heterogeneity and fructose transporter expression in the rat nephron by integrating single-cell and microdissected tubule segment transcriptomes\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Jadhav, D. A.; Kramer, B. K.; Gonzalez-Vicente, A.; Kidney Precision Medicine Project, Score: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572656\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{+/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{+/-}9% S1, 58{+/-}8% S2, and 19{+/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{+/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p\u003c1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p\u003c4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.\nExogenous mitochondrial transfer increases energy expenditure and attenuates adiposity gains in mice with diet-induced obesity\nAuthors: Namwanje, M.; Mazumdar, S.; Stayton, A.; Patel, P. S.; Watkins, C.; White, C.; Brown, C.; Eason, J. D.; Mozhui, K.; Kuscu, C.; Pabla, N.; Stephenson, E. J.; Bajwa, A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573206\nObesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.\nMotor mirror neurons may not be a predictor of learning but reflect the effect of motor learning\nAuthors: Blagoveshchenski, E.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.572003\nThe mirror neurons system (MNS) fires during both the performance of an action and observation of the same action being performed by another. On the level of motor output, activation of the MNS is thought to be represented in the phenomenon of motor resonance, which manifests in a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focused on how and to what extent sensorimotor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of sensorimotor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was held to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation in different conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions in total), the sensorimotor learning part was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task. We observed a statistically significant decrease of reaction time in the process of learning in the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting the process of putative mirror neurons activity. However, our data demonstrate that the sensorimotor learning rate was not associated with either pretraining or post-training estimates of motor facilitation during action observation and that sensorimotor learning does not affect the pattern of motor resonance.\nSpatially and Blood Flow-Dependent Tissue Distribution of Thyroid Hormones by Plasma Thyroid Hormone Binding Proteins\nAuthors: Bagga, A. D.; Johnson, B. P.; Zhang, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572629\nPlasma thyroid hormone (TH) binding proteins (THBPs), including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB), are important in regulating thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). THBPs carry THs to extrathyroidal sites, where THs are unloaded locally and then taken up via membrane transporters into the tissue proper. The respective roles of THBPs in supplying THs for tissue uptake are not completely understood. To investigate this question, we developed a spatial human physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model of THs, which produces several novel findings. (1) Contrary to postulations that TTR and/or ALB are the major local TH contributors, the three THBPs may unload comparable amounts of T4 in Liver, a rapidly perfused organ; however, their contribution in Rest-of-Body (RB), which is more slowly perfused, follows the order of abundance of T4TBG, T4TTR, and T4ALB. The T3 amounts unloaded in both compartments follow the order of abundance of T3TBG, T3ALB, and T3TTR. (2) Any THBP alone is sufficient to maintain spatially uniform TH tissue distributions. (3) The TH amounts unloaded by each THBP species are spatially dependent and nonlinear in a tissue, with ALB being the dominant contributor near the arterial end but conceding to TBG near the venous end. (4) Spatial gradients of TH transporters and metabolic enzymes may modulate these contributions, producing spatially invariant or heterogeneous TH tissue concentrations depending on whether the blood-tissue TH fluxes operate in near-equilibrium mode. In summary, our modeling provides novel insights into the differential roles of THBPs in local TH tissue distribution and homeostasis.\nInhibition of MMP 2 protects the endothelial glycocalyx and improves diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: Buffonge, S.; Qiu, Y.; Fawaz, S.; Gamez, M.; Crompton, M.; Butler, M. J.; Welsh, G. I.; Madeddu, P.; Foster, R. R.; Satchell, S. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572183\nThe coronary microvascular endothelial glycocalyx (EGlx) is a vital regulator of vascular permeability and EGlx damage contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) have been identified as key enzymes in the degradation of EGlx components, notably syndecan 4 (SDC4), and are upregulated in diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of MMP2/9 can protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Type 1 diabetes was induced in FVB mice by streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Mice were treated with daily injections of the MMP2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, for 2 weeks from 7 weeks post STZ. Echocardiography was utilised to assess heart function and lectin staining for the measurement of EGlx depth. Immunolabelling of heart sections for albumin provided an indication of albumin extravasation. A mechanism of EGlx shedding was investigated in vitro in human coronary microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF- and SB-3CT. Diabetic mice developed diastolic dysfunction from 6 weeks post STZ. MMP2/9 inhibition reversed diastolic dysfunction, EGlx thinning and albumin extravasation in diabetic animals. In vitro, TNF- caused an increase in MMP9 activity and SDC4 shedding from human coronary microvascular endothelial cells. Treatment with SB-3CT reduced MMP9 activity and prevented SDC4 shedding. Knockdown of MMP9 expression prevented TNF- induced SDC4 shedding. This study demonstrates MMP2/9 inhibition as a strategy to protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our findings suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.

C.; Vu, N.; Westermark, A. M.; Danai, L. V.; Lau, A. N.; Gultekin, Y.; Kukurugya, M. A.; Bennett, B. D.; Vander Heiden, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572088\nAging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD+, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD+ regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD+-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD+/NADH during healthy aging.\nAge-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are moreaffected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging\nAuthors: Kurochkina, N. S.; Orlova, M. A.; Vigovskiy, M. A.; Vepkhvadze, T. F.; Zgoda, V. G.; Vavilov, N. E.; Makhnovskii, P. A.; Grigorieva, O. A.; Boroday, Y. R.; Philippov, V. V.; Lednev, E. M.; Efimenko, A. Y.; Popov, D. V.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569524\nEvaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa &#43; T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender youth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{&#43;/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{&#43;/-}9% S1, 58{&#43;/-}8% S2, and 19{&#43;/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{&#43;/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p&lt;1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p&lt;4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mirror neurons system (MNS) fires during both the performance of an action and observation of the same action being performed by another. On the level of motor output, activation of the MNS is thought to be represented in the phenomenon of motor resonance, which manifests in a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focused on how and to what extent sensorimotor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of sensorimotor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was held to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation in different conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions in total), the sensorimotor learning part was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task. We observed a statistically significant decrease of reaction time in the process of learning in the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting the process of putative mirror neurons activity. However, our data demonstrate that the sensorimotor learning rate was not associated with either pretraining or post-training estimates of motor facilitation during action observation and that sensorimotor learning does not affect the pattern of motor resonance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plasma thyroid hormone (TH) binding proteins (THBPs), including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB), are important in regulating thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). THBPs carry THs to extrathyroidal sites, where THs are unloaded locally and then taken up via membrane transporters into the tissue proper. The respective roles of THBPs in supplying THs for tissue uptake are not completely understood. To investigate this question, we developed a spatial human physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model of THs, which produces several novel findings. (1) Contrary to postulations that TTR and/or ALB are the major local TH contributors, the three THBPs may unload comparable amounts of T4 in Liver, a rapidly perfused organ; however, their contribution in Rest-of-Body (RB), which is more slowly perfused, follows the order of abundance of T4TBG, T4TTR, and T4ALB. The T3 amounts unloaded in both compartments follow the order of abundance of T3TBG, T3ALB, and T3TTR. (2) Any THBP alone is sufficient to maintain spatially uniform TH tissue distributions. (3) The TH amounts unloaded by each THBP species are spatially dependent and nonlinear in a tissue, with ALB being the dominant contributor near the arterial end but conceding to TBG near the venous end. (4) Spatial gradients of TH transporters and metabolic enzymes may modulate these contributions, producing spatially invariant or heterogeneous TH tissue concentrations depending on whether the blood-tissue TH fluxes operate in near-equilibrium mode. In summary, our modeling provides novel insights into the differential roles of THBPs in local TH tissue distribution and homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The coronary microvascular endothelial glycocalyx (EGlx) is a vital regulator of vascular permeability and EGlx damage contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) have been identified as key enzymes in the degradation of EGlx components, notably syndecan 4 (SDC4), and are upregulated in diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of MMP2/9 can protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Type 1 diabetes was induced in FVB mice by streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Mice were treated with daily injections of the MMP2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, for 2 weeks from 7 weeks post STZ. Echocardiography was utilised to assess heart function and lectin staining for the measurement of EGlx depth. Immunolabelling of heart sections for albumin provided an indication of albumin extravasation. A mechanism of EGlx shedding was investigated in vitro in human coronary microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF- and SB-3CT. Diabetic mice developed diastolic dysfunction from 6 weeks post STZ. MMP2/9 inhibition reversed diastolic dysfunction, EGlx thinning and albumin extravasation in diabetic animals. In vitro, TNF- caused an increase in MMP9 activity and SDC4 shedding from human coronary microvascular endothelial cells. Treatment with SB-3CT reduced MMP9 activity and prevented SDC4 shedding. Knockdown of MMP9 expression prevented TNF- induced SDC4 shedding. This study demonstrates MMP2/9 inhibition as a strategy to protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our findings suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.

        <p class="abstract">Aging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD&#43;, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD&#43;, NADH, and the NAD&#43;/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD&#43; from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD&#43; regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD&#43;-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD&#43;/NADH during healthy aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.</p>
