C.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547547\nLoss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.\nA Medium Chain Fatty Acid, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (6-HHA), Protects Against Obesity and Insulin Resistance\nAuthors: Sebag, S. S.; Qian, Q.; Upara, C.; Ding, Q.; Hong, L.; Yang, L.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549684\nObesity, a worldwide health problem, increases the risk for developing metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and diabetes. It is well recognized that obesity-associated chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of systemic metabolic dysfunction. Previously, we revealed an anti-inflammatory role for spent culture supernatants isolated from the oral commensal bacterial species Streptococcus gordonii (Sg-SCS). Here, we identified that 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (6-HHA), a medium chain fatty acid (MCFA), is the one of the key components of Sg-SCS. We found that treatment of 6-HHA in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly reduced HFD-mediated weight gain which was largely attributed to a decrease in fat mass. Systemically, 6-HHA improves obesity-associated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, administration of 6-HHA suppressed obesity-associated systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia. At the cellular level, treatment of 6-HHA ameliorated aberrant inflammatory and metabolic transcriptomic signatures in white adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity (HFD). Mechanistically, we found that 6-HHA suppressed adipocyte-proinflammatory cytokine production and lipolysis, the latter through Gi-mediated signaling. This work provides direct evidence for the anti-obesity effects of a novel MCFA, which could be a new therapeutic treatment for combating obesity. KEY POINTSO_LIHydroxyhexanoic medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are dietary and bacterial-derived energy sources, however, the outcomes of using MCFAs in treating metabolic disorders are diverse and complex. C_LIO_LIThe MCFA 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (6-HHA) is a metabolite secreted by the oral bacterial commensal species Streptococcus gordonii; here we investigated its role in modulating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic dysfunction. C_LIO_LIIn a murine model of obesity, we found 6-HHA-mediated improvement of diet-mediated adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation were in part due to actions on white adipose tissue (WAT). C_LIO_LI6-HHA suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and lipolysis through Gi-mediated signaling in differentiated white adipocytes. C_LI\nA temperature-controlled, circular maintenance system for studying growth and development of pelagic tunicates (Salps)\nAuthors: Mueller, S. J.; Wessels, W.; Driscoll, S.; Pakhomov, E. A.; Auerswald, L.; Michael, K.; Meyer, B.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.547827\nSalps are pelagic tunicates that are able to form large blooms under favorable conditions by alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction. While their role in the regional carbon cycle is receiving attention, our knowledge of their physiology is still limited. This knowledge gap is mainly due to their fragile gelatinous nature, which makes it difficult to capture intact specimens and maintain them in the laboratory. We present here a modified kreisel tank system, that was tested onboard using the Southern Ocean salp Salpa thompsoni and station-based using the Mediterranean species Salpa fusiformis. Successful maintenance over days to weeks allowed us to obtain comparable relative growth and developmental rates as in situ, and provided insight into their potential life cycle strategies. By providing a starting point for successful maintenance, we hope to stimulate future experimental research on this understudied taxonomic group.\nNew body typology method based on the combination of coupling motion of pelvis, thorax, and cranium.\nAuthors: Niitsuma, M.; Imai, S.; Mimuro, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549262\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen the understanding of unconscious intrinsic individuality by proposing and verifying the hypothesis of \"Integrated Spine Coupling\" which is defined by the combination of the way of the coupling motion of 3 major units of our body: pelvis, thorax, and cranium. This paper, as the first step of the verification, examines how each of the three units -- pelvis, thorax, and cranium as the representative units of cervical, thoracic, and lumber spines -- produces a coupling motion during body rotational movement, and how the types of combinations are related to other movements such as breathing. The measurement results suggest that there exist only four types of coupling motion patterns and it significantly affects the way they breath and move their ankle and toe.\nThe Effect of Gradual Ovarian Failure on Dynamic Muscle Function and the Role of High Intensity Interval Training on Mitigating Impairments\nAuthors: Hubbard, E. F.; Mashouri, P.; Pyle, W. G.; Power, G. A.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548999\nSkeletal muscle function is impaired in menopause and exercise may mitigate tshis decline. We used the VCD model of menopause to investigate the effects of gradual ovarian failure on skeletal muscle contractile function and whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) can mitigate impairments. Sexually mature female CD-1 mice were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=5), VCD-sedentary (n=5), or VCD-training (n=5). Following ovarian failure, the VCD-training group underwent 8 weeks of uphill HIIT. Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after ovarian failure, representing late menopause. Single muscle fibres from the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected, chemically permeabilized, and mechanically tested. Single muscle fibres were maximally activated (pCa 4.5) then isotonic load clamps were performed to calculate force-velocity-power curves. Absolute force and peak power were 31% and 32% lower in VCD-sedentary fibres compared to control fibres, respectively, in both SOL and EDL muscles. Despite reductions in absolute force and therefore lighter relative loads imposed during the isotonic contractions in VCD-sedentary fibres, there were no concomitant increases in contractile velocity. HIIT was partially effective at mitigating power loss (22% higher peak power in VCD-training compared to VCD-sedentary), but only in fast-type SOL fibres. These findings indicate that ovarian failure impairs dynamic contractile function - likely through a combination of lower force-generating capacity and slower shortening velocity - and that HIIT may be insufficient to completely counteract the deleterious effects of menopause at the cellular level. New \u0026 NoteworthyO_LIReductions in circulating ovarian hormones impair static muscle contractile performance, but less is known about dynamic properties like power. C_LIO_LITypically, rodent models of menopause completely remove the ovaries and fail to mimic the prolonged and complex hormonal transition that includes a retention in ovarian androgen production. C_LIO_LIUsing an ovary intact VCD model of ovarian failure, we found that single fibre power was impaired compared with controls in both SOL and EDL fibres. C_LIO_LIOur uphill high intensity interval training program was partially sufficient to reverse power loss, but only in fast-type SOL fibres. C_LIO_LIImpairments in muscle power following ovarian failure are likely driven by a combination of decreased muscle size and force-generating capacity. C_LI\nPIEZO1 force sensing controls global lipid homeostasis\nAuthors: Lichtenstein, L.; Cheng, C. W.; Evans, E. L.; Gaunt, H. J.; Bartoli, F.; Chuntharpursat-Bon, E.; Patel, S.; Konstantinou, C.; Futers, S.; Reay, M.; Parsonage, G.; Bertrand-Michel, J.; Sukumar, P.; Roberts, L. D.; Beech, D. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550198\nHow cardiovascular activity beneficially regulates lipid homeostasis is unclear. Here we hypothesise a mechanism in which mechanical force sensed by PIEZO1 ion channels in endothelium links blood flow to lipid regulation. We engineered mice for conditional deletion of PIEZO1 in endothelium and determined consequences for lipid regulation. Prominent are upregulated expression of hepatic Cyp7a1 and intestinal Ldlr genes, which are pivotal in cholesterol catabolism and excretion. Consistent with such regulation is endothelial PIEZO1-dependence of hepatic, intestinal and whole body cholesterol and bile homeostasis. There is organ perfusion-dependent gene regulation via endothelial PIEZO1 and downstream nitric oxide synthase. Endothelial PIEZO1-deleted mice are protected against hyperlipidaemia and ectopic fat deposition. Human PIEZO1 gene variants and a recapitulated human PIEZO1 gain-of-function variant in mice associate with dyslipidaemia. The data suggest lipid-promoting effects of endothelial force sensing and new opportunity for understanding and addressing problems of hyperlipidaemia.\nCRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of ESR1 in preoptic GABA-kisspeptin neurons abolishes the preovulatory surge and estrous cycles in female mice\nAuthors: Clarkson, J.; Yip, S. H.; Porteous, R.; Kauff, A.; Heather, A. K.; Herbison, A. E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.548652\nEvidence suggests that estradiol-sensing preoptic area GABA neurons are involved in the pre-ovulatory surge mechanism necessary for ovulation. In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to achieve a 60-70% knockdown in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression by GABA neurons located within the region of the rostral periventricular of the third ventricle (RP3V) and medial preoptic nuclei (MPN) in adult female mice. Mice exhibited variable reproductive phenotypes with the only significant finding being those mice with bilateral ESR1 deletion in RP3V GABA neurons that had reduced cFos expression in GnRH neurons at the time of the surge. One sub-population of RP3V GABA neurons expresses kisspeptin. Re-grouping ESR1-edited mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression revealed a highly consistent phenotype; mice with a near complete loss of kisspeptin immunoreactivity displayed constant estrus and failed to exhibit surge activation but retained pulsatile LH secretion. These observations demonstrate ESR1-expressing GABA-kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are essential for the murine preovulatory LH surge mechanism.\nExposure to early life stress impairs weight loss maintenance success in mice.\nAuthors: Foright, R. M.; McQuillan, T. E.; Frick, J. M.; Minchella, P. M.; Levasseur, B. M.; Tinoco, O.; Birmingham, L.; Lewis, A. E.; Thyfault, J. P.; Christianson, J. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549724\nEarly life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.\nNetwork and structural analysis of quail mucins with expression pattern of MUC1 and MUC4 in the intestines of the Iraqi Common Quail (Coturnix Coturnix)\nAuthors: Almhanna, H.; AL-Mahmodi, A. M. M.; Kadhim, A. B.; Kumar, A. H.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549497\nBackgroundMucins have vital pathophysiological role in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of avian and other species. However, despite this very little is known about the types of mucins expressed in quail GIT. Hence in this study we examined the expression pattern of mucins (MUC1, and MUC4) in the GIT of the Iraqi Common Quail (Coturnix Coturnix) and performed the network and structural analysis of all reported types of mucins in various breeds of quails. Materials and methodsThis study protocol was approved by the animal ethics research committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Qadisiyah, Iraq. Fresh samples of small and large intestines were used for histological and gene expression analysis of MUC1, and MUC4. Network and structural analysis of all reported types of mucins in quails was performed using the STRING Database, Chimera software and PrankWeb-Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool. ResultsThe histological analysis using Alcian blue and PAS stains indicated that most mucins in the intestines of quails were of the acidic mucin type, with minimal prevalence of neutral mucins. The expression of acidic mucins was relatively higher in the duodenum, ileum, caecum, and colon, while the jejunum showed a relatively higher expression of neutral mucins. Gene expression analysis revealed higher expression levels of MUC1 and MUC4 mRNA in the jejunum and colon, with its least expression in the duodenum and ilium. Network analysis indicated predominantly mucin-mucin interactions, with MUC 1, 15, 16 and 24 showing preferential homologous networks while the MUC 2, 4, 5 and 6 showed heterologous networks. Detailed evaluation of intermolecular hydrogen bond formation highlighted the interactions between specific mucin combinations, with certain combinations showing higher affinity, such as MUC5A-MUC6, MUC5A-MUC5B, and MUC5B-MUC6. In contrast, MUC15, MUC16, and MUC24 exhibited limited interactions with other mucin types. Binding site analysis indicated that MUC5B and MUC6 had the most number of binding sites with high probability scores, while MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5A showed lower probability scores despite having more binding sites. In contrast MUC 1, 15, and 16 had very few binding sites (\u003c3 binding sites) all with very low probability scores. ConclusionThe findings of this study provide valuable insights into the composition, expression, network interactions, and binding sites of mucins in the quails, contributing to the understanding of mucin-related processes in gastrointestinal physiology and potential implications for gastrointestinal diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity, a worldwide health problem, increases the risk for developing metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and diabetes. It is well recognized that obesity-associated chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of systemic metabolic dysfunction. Previously, we revealed an anti-inflammatory role for spent culture supernatants isolated from the oral commensal bacterial species Streptococcus gordonii (Sg-SCS). Here, we identified that 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (6-HHA), a medium chain fatty acid (MCFA), is the one of the key components of Sg-SCS. We found that treatment of 6-HHA in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly reduced HFD-mediated weight gain which was largely attributed to a decrease in fat mass. Systemically, 6-HHA improves obesity-associated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, administration of 6-HHA suppressed obesity-associated systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia. At the cellular level, treatment of 6-HHA ameliorated aberrant inflammatory and metabolic transcriptomic signatures in white adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity (HFD). Mechanistically, we found that 6-HHA suppressed adipocyte-proinflammatory cytokine production and lipolysis, the latter through Gi-mediated signaling. This work provides direct evidence for the anti-obesity effects of a novel MCFA, which could be a new therapeutic treatment for combating obesity.

KEY POINTSO_LIHydroxyhexanoic medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are dietary and bacterial-derived energy sources, however, the outcomes of using MCFAs in treating metabolic disorders are diverse and complex.
C_LIO_LIThe MCFA 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid (6-HHA) is a metabolite secreted by the oral bacterial commensal species Streptococcus gordonii; here we investigated its role in modulating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic dysfunction.
C_LIO_LIIn a murine model of obesity, we found 6-HHA-mediated improvement of diet-mediated adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation were in part due to actions on white adipose tissue (WAT).
C_LIO_LI6-HHA suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and lipolysis through Gi-mediated signaling in differentiated white adipocytes.

        <p class="abstract">Salps are pelagic tunicates that are able to form large blooms under favorable conditions by alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction. While their role in the regional carbon cycle is receiving attention, our knowledge of their physiology is still limited. This knowledge gap is mainly due to their fragile gelatinous nature, which makes it difficult to capture intact specimens and maintain them in the laboratory. We present here a modified kreisel tank system, that was tested onboard using the Southern Ocean salp Salpa thompsoni and station-based using the Mediterranean species Salpa fusiformis. Successful maintenance over days to weeks allowed us to obtain comparable relative growth and developmental rates as in situ, and provided insight into their potential life cycle strategies. By providing a starting point for successful maintenance, we hope to stimulate future experimental research on this understudied taxonomic group.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The purpose of this study is to deepen the understanding of unconscious intrinsic individuality by proposing and verifying the hypothesis of &#34;Integrated Spine Coupling&#34; which is defined by the combination of the way of the coupling motion of 3 major units of our body: pelvis, thorax, and cranium. This paper, as the first step of the verification, examines how each of the three units -- pelvis, thorax, and cranium as the representative units of cervical, thoracic, and lumber spines -- produces a coupling motion during body rotational movement, and how the types of combinations are related to other movements such as breathing. The measurement results suggest that there exist only four types of coupling motion patterns and it significantly affects the way they breath and move their ankle and toe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle function is impaired in menopause and exercise may mitigate tshis decline. We used the VCD model of menopause to investigate the effects of gradual ovarian failure on skeletal muscle contractile function and whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) can mitigate impairments. Sexually mature female CD-1 mice were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=5), VCD-sedentary (n=5), or VCD-training (n=5). Following ovarian failure, the VCD-training group underwent 8 weeks of uphill HIIT. Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after ovarian failure, representing late menopause. Single muscle fibres from the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected, chemically permeabilized, and mechanically tested. Single muscle fibres were maximally activated (pCa 4.5) then isotonic load clamps were performed to calculate force-velocity-power curves. Absolute force and peak power were 31% and 32% lower in VCD-sedentary fibres compared to control fibres, respectively, in both SOL and EDL muscles. Despite reductions in absolute force and therefore lighter relative loads imposed during the isotonic contractions in VCD-sedentary fibres, there were no concomitant increases in contractile velocity. HIIT was partially effective at mitigating power loss (22% higher peak power in VCD-training compared to VCD-sedentary), but only in fast-type SOL fibres. These findings indicate that ovarian failure impairs dynamic contractile function - likely through a combination of lower force-generating capacity and slower shortening velocity - and that HIIT may be insufficient to completely counteract the deleterious effects of menopause at the cellular level.

New &amp; NoteworthyO_LIReductions in circulating ovarian hormones impair static muscle contractile performance, but less is known about dynamic properties like power.
C_LIO_LITypically, rodent models of menopause completely remove the ovaries and fail to mimic the prolonged and complex hormonal transition that includes a retention in ovarian androgen production.
C_LIO_LIUsing an ovary intact VCD model of ovarian failure, we found that single fibre power was impaired compared with controls in both SOL and EDL fibres.
C_LIO_LIOur uphill high intensity interval training program was partially sufficient to reverse power loss, but only in fast-type SOL fibres.
C_LIO_LIImpairments in muscle power following ovarian failure are likely driven by a combination of decreased muscle size and force-generating capacity.

        <p class="abstract">How cardiovascular activity beneficially regulates lipid homeostasis is unclear. Here we hypothesise a mechanism in which mechanical force sensed by PIEZO1 ion channels in endothelium links blood flow to lipid regulation. We engineered mice for conditional deletion of PIEZO1 in endothelium and determined consequences for lipid regulation. Prominent are upregulated expression of hepatic Cyp7a1 and intestinal Ldlr genes, which are pivotal in cholesterol catabolism and excretion. Consistent with such regulation is endothelial PIEZO1-dependence of hepatic, intestinal and whole body cholesterol and bile homeostasis. There is organ perfusion-dependent gene regulation via endothelial PIEZO1 and downstream nitric oxide synthase. Endothelial PIEZO1-deleted mice are protected against hyperlipidaemia and ectopic fat deposition. Human PIEZO1 gene variants and a recapitulated human PIEZO1 gain-of-function variant in mice associate with dyslipidaemia. The data suggest lipid-promoting effects of endothelial force sensing and new opportunity for understanding and addressing problems of hyperlipidaemia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evidence suggests that estradiol-sensing preoptic area GABA neurons are involved in the pre-ovulatory surge mechanism necessary for ovulation. In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to achieve a 60-70% knockdown in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression by GABA neurons located within the region of the rostral periventricular of the third ventricle (RP3V) and medial preoptic nuclei (MPN) in adult female mice. Mice exhibited variable reproductive phenotypes with the only significant finding being those mice with bilateral ESR1 deletion in RP3V GABA neurons that had reduced cFos expression in GnRH neurons at the time of the surge. One sub-population of RP3V GABA neurons expresses kisspeptin. Re-grouping ESR1-edited mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression revealed a highly consistent phenotype; mice with a near complete loss of kisspeptin immunoreactivity displayed constant estrus and failed to exhibit surge activation but retained pulsatile LH secretion. These observations demonstrate ESR1-expressing GABA-kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are essential for the murine preovulatory LH surge mechanism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.</p>

Hence in this study we examined the expression pattern of mucins (MUC1, and MUC4) in the GIT of the Iraqi Common Quail (Coturnix Coturnix) and performed the network and structural analysis of all reported types of mucins in various breeds of quails.

Materials and methodsThis study protocol was approved by the animal ethics research committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Qadisiyah, Iraq. Fresh samples of small and large intestines were used for histological and gene expression analysis of MUC1, and MUC4. Network and structural analysis of all reported types of mucins in quails was performed using the STRING Database, Chimera software and PrankWeb-Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool.

ResultsThe histological analysis using Alcian blue and PAS stains indicated that most mucins in the intestines of quails were of the acidic mucin type, with minimal prevalence of neutral mucins. The expression of acidic mucins was relatively higher in the duodenum, ileum, caecum, and colon, while the jejunum showed a relatively higher expression of neutral mucins. Gene expression analysis revealed higher expression levels of MUC1 and MUC4 mRNA in the jejunum and colon, with its least expression in the duodenum and ilium. Network analysis indicated predominantly mucin-mucin interactions, with MUC 1, 15, 16 and 24 showing preferential homologous networks while the MUC 2, 4, 5 and 6 showed heterologous networks. Detailed evaluation of intermolecular hydrogen bond formation highlighted the interactions between specific mucin combinations, with certain combinations showing higher affinity, such as MUC5A-MUC6, MUC5A-MUC5B, and MUC5B-MUC6. In contrast, MUC15, MUC16, and MUC24 exhibited limited interactions with other mucin types. Binding site analysis indicated that MUC5B and MUC6 had the most number of binding sites with high probability scores, while MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5A showed lower probability scores despite having more binding sites. In contrast MUC 1, 15, and 16 had very few binding sites (&lt;3 binding sites) all with very low probability scores.

ConclusionThe findings of this study provide valuable insights into the composition, expression, network interactions, and binding sites of mucins in the quails, contributing to the understanding of mucin-related processes in gastrointestinal physiology and potential implications for gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
