H.; Bashir, A.; Beyers, R. J.; Henselmans, M.; Contreras, B. M.; Roberts, M. D.\nScore: 40.3, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nMetabolic transitions regulate global protein fatty acylation\nAuthors: Talwadekar, M.; Khatri, S.; Balaji, C.; Chakraborty, A.; Basak, N.-P.; Kamat, S.; Kolthur-Seetharam, U.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545712\nIntermediary metabolites and flux through various pathways have emerged as key determinants of post-translational modifications. Independently, dynamic fluctuations in their concentrations are known to drive cellular energetics in a bi-directional manner. Notably, intracellular fatty acid pools that drastically change during fed and fasted states act as precursors for both ATP production and fatty acylation of proteins. Protein fatty acylation is well regarded for its role in regulating structure and functions of diverse proteins, however the effect of intracellular concentrations of fatty acids on protein modification is less understood. In this regard, we unequivocally demonstrate that metabolic contexts, viz. fed and fasted states, dictate the extent of global fatty acylation. Moreover, we show that presence or absence of glucose, that influences cellular and mitochondrial uptake/utilization of fatty acids, affects palmitoylation and oleoylation, which is consistent with their intracellular abundance in fed and fasted states. Employing complementary approaches including click-chemistry, lipidomics and imaging, we show the top-down control of cellular metabolic state. Importantly, our results establish the crucial role of mitochondria and retrograde signaling components like SIRT4, AMPK and mTOR in orchestrating protein fatty acylation at a whole cell level. Specifically, pharmacogenetic perturbations that alter either mitochondrial functions and/or retrograde signaling affect protein fatty acylation. Besides illustrating the cross-talk between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mediating bulk post-translational modification, our findings also highlight the involvement of mitochondrial energetics.\nCross-species comparison of pregnancy-induced GDF15\nAuthors: Klein, A.; Ranea-Robles, P.; Nicolaisen, T.; Gil, C.; Johann, K.; Quesada, J.; Pistolevij, N.; Hviid, K.; Olsen, L.; Offersen, S.; Helge, J.; Svarre-Nielsen, H.; Bakker, J.; Kleinert, M.; Clemmensen, C.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545552\nGDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is a stress-induced cytokine. Although the exact physiological function of GDF15 is not yet fully comprehended, the significant elevation of circulating GDF15 levels during gestation suggests a potential role for this hormone in pregnancy. This is corroborated by genetic association studies in which GDF15 and the GDF15 receptor, GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL) have been linked to morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in humans. Here, we studied GDF15 biology during pregnancy in mice, rats, macaques, and humans. In contrast to macaques and humans, mice and rats exhibited an underwhelming induction in plasma GDF15 levels in response to pregnancy ([~]75-fold increase in macaques vs. [~]2-fold increase in rodents). The changes in circulating GDF15 levels were corroborated by the magnitude of Gdf15 mRNA and GDF15 protein expression in placentae from mice, rats, and macaques. These species-specific findings may help guide future studies focusing on GDF15 in pregnancy and on the evaluation of pharmacological strategies to interfere with GDF15-GFRAL signaling to treat severe nausea and HG.\nNo sex differences in oxygen uptake or extraction kinetics in the moderate or heavy exercise intensity domains\nAuthors: Solleiro Pons, M.; Bernert, L.; Hume, E.; Hughes, L.; Williams, Z.; Burnley, M.; Ansdell, P.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546455\nThe integrative response to exercise differs between sexes, with oxidative energy provision purported as a potential mechanism. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the kinetics of oxygen uptake ([V]O2) and extraction (HHb+Mb) during exercise in both sexes. Sixteen young adults (8 females, age: 27{+/-}5 years) completed three experimental visits. Incremental exercise testing was performed to obtain lactate threshold and [V]O2peak. Subsequent visits involved three six-minute cycling bouts at 80% of lactate threshold and one 30-minute bout at a work rate 30% between the lactate threshold and maximal ramp test power. Pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy continuously sampled [V]O2 and HHb+Mb, respectively. The mean of six moderate and two heavy intensity transitions were modelled with mono-exponential curves to quantify the phase II response to exercise. Slow component amplitudes were also quantified for the heavy intensity domain. Males and females demonstrated similar relative [V]O2peak values (46.2{+/-}6.6 vs 40.5{+/-}6.7 ml.kg-1.min-1, p=0.111), with males achieving ~30% greater power outputs (p=0.002). In both the moderate and heavy intensity domains, the relative amplitude of the phase II transition was similar between sexes for [V]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.179) and HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.193). Similarly, there were no sex differences in the time constants for [V]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.385) or HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.274). In the heavy intensity domain, neither [V]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.686) or HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.432) slow component amplitudes were different between sexes. The oxidative response to moderate and heavy intensity exercise did not differ between males and females, suggesting both sexes experience similar degrees of bioenergetic stress during intensity-matched exercise.\nCalcineurin inhibition enhances Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan by defecation defects-mediated calorie restriction and nuclear hormone signaling\nAuthors: Das, P.; Aballay, A.; Singh, J.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545873\nCalcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan via multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating by calcineurin inhibition mimics calorie restriction that results in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan enhancement by triggering lipolysis. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is required for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.\nGDF15 is a Critical Renostat in the Defense Against Hypoglycemia\nAuthors: Li, Z.; Zhang, X.; Zhu, W.; Xu, Q.; Yu, C.; Zhao, Q.; Siebel, S.; Zhang, C.; Costa Lima, B. G.; Li, X.; Israni-Winger, K.; Nasiri, A. R.; Caplan, M. J.; Chang, R. B.; Wang, A.; Belfort de Aguiar, R.; Hwang, J. J.; Perry, R. J.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546095\nEpisodic hypoglycemia is one of the best honed, evolutionary conserved phenomena in biology, because of the constant feast-fast cycles that have characterized most of history. The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, mobilizing substrate stores to produce glucose, is the primary adaptive mechanism to enable survival. Catecholamines and glucagon have long been considered the key hypoglycemia counterregulatory hormones, but here we identify a new hypoglycemia counterregulatory factor. We employed the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp to mimic the two common settings in which hypoglycemia can occur in patients: postprandial insulin overdose and elevated basal insulin administration, respectively. We found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) production is induced in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubules and its release increases hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing intrahepatic lipolysis in a beta-adrenergic receptor-2 (Adrb2)-dependent manner. In addition, mice exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia and patients with T1D exhibit impaired GDF15 production in the setting of hypoglycemia. These data demonstrate that GDF15 acts acutely as a gluco-counterregulatory hormone and identify a critical role for kidney-derived GDF15 in glucose homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.\nAccommodation and wavelength: the effect of longitudinal chromatic aberration on the stimulus-response curve.\nAuthors: Fernandez-Alonso, M.; Finch, A.; Love, G. D.; Read, J. C. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545755\nThe longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) of the eye creates a chromatic blur on the retina that is an important cue for accommodation. While this mechanism can work optimally in broadband illuminants such as daylight, it is not clear how the system responds to the narrowband illuminants used by many modern displays. Here, we measured pupil and accommodative responses as well as visual acuity under narrowband LED illuminants of different peak wavelengths. Observers were able to accommodate under narrowband light and compensate for the LCA of the eye, with no difference in the variability of the steady-state accommodation response between narrowband and broadband illuminants. Intriguingly, our subjects compensated more fully for LCA at nearer distances. That is, the difference in accommodation to different wavelengths became larger when the object was placed nearer the observer, causing the slope of the accommodation response curve to become shallower for shorter wavelengths and steeper for longer ones. Within the accommodative range of observers, accommodative errors were small and visual acuity normal. When comparing between illuminants, when accommodation was accurate, visual acuity was worst for blue narrowband light. This cannot be due to the sparser spacing for S-cones, since our stimuli had equal luminance and thus activated M-cones roughly equally. It is likely because ocular LCA changes more rapidly at shorter wavelength, and so the finite spectral bandwidth of LEDs corresponds to a greater dioptric range at shorter wavelengths. This effect disappears for larger accommodative errors, due to the increased depth-of-focus of the eye.\nWhy not both? A case study measuring cortisol and corticosterone in poison frogs\nAuthors: Westrick, S. E.; Paitz, R. T.; Fischer, E. K.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545597\nA general tenet in stress physiology is that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis predominantly produces one glucocorticoid (GC) in response to stressors. Researchers typically measure only the GC believed to be dominant in their species of interest; however, the two main glucocorticoids produced by vertebrates- cortisol and corticosterone -- show variation across species in absolute levels, relative proportions, and stress responsivity. Therefore, generalizing assumptions and focusing on a single GC may not tell the whole story. In this study, we measured both cortisol and corticosterone in water samples collected from five species of Dendrobatid poison frogs. Understanding the full picture of the physiological stress response in poison frogs is of special interest due to their susceptibility to environmental stressors and conservation status. Counter to the dogma that corticosterone is dominant and more abundant in amphibians, we found cortisol was more abundant than corticosterone in four of the five species. Dendrobates tinctorius was unique in releasing equal amounts of cortisol and corticosterone. When we stimulated the HPA axis in D. tinctorius, we found corticosterone was responsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), while cortisol did not change. Comparing plasma and water samples, we found water-borne cortisol was positively correlated with cortisol in plasma and the relationship between plasma and water-borne corticosterone was positive but not statistically significant. These results challenge the broadly accepted assumption that corticosterone is dominant in amphibians and add to the growing literature highlighting the importance of measuring both GCs to understand (stress) physiology.\nEstimating Insulin Sensitivity and Beta-Cell Function from the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: Validation of a new Insulin Sensitivity and Secretion (ISS) Model\nAuthors: Ha, J.; Chung, S. T.; Springer, M.; Kim, J. Y.; Chen, P.; Cree, M. G.; Behn, C. D.; Sumner, A. E.; Arslanian, S.; Sherman, A. S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545377\nEfficient and accurate methods to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI) and beta-cell function (BCF) are of great importance for studying the pathogenesis and treatment effectiveness of type 2 diabetes. Many methods exist, ranging in input data and technical requirements. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are preferred because they are simpler and more physiological. However, current analytical methods for OGTT-derived SI and BCF also range in complexity; the oral minimal models require mathematical expertise for deconvolution and fitting differential equations, and simple algebraic models (e.g., Matsuda index, insulinogenic index) may produce unphysiological values. We developed a new ISS (Insulin Secretion and Sensitivity) model for clinical research that provides precise and accurate estimates of SI and BCF from a standard OGTT, focusing on effectiveness, ease of implementation, and pragmatism. The model was developed by fitting a pair of differential equations to glucose and insulin without need of deconvolution or C-peptide data. The model is derived from a published model for longitudinal simulation of T2D progression that represents glucose-insulin homeostasis, including post-challenge suppression of hepatic glucose production and first- and second-phase insulin secretion. The ISS model was evaluated in three diverse cohorts including individuals at high risk of prediabetes (adult women with a wide range of BMI and adolescents with obesity). The new model had strong correlation with gold-standard estimates from intravenous glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The ISS model has broad clinical applicability among diverse populations because it balances performance, fidelity, and complexity to provide a reliable phenotype of T2D risk.\nMaternal, placental and fetal response to a non-viral, polymetric nanoparticle gene therapy in nonhuman primates\nAuthors: Wilson, R. L.; Kropp Schmidt, J.; Davenport, B. N.; Ren, E.; Keding, L. T.; Shaw, S.; Schotzko, M. L.; Antony, K.; Simmons, H. A.; Golos, T.; Jones, H.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545278\nBackgroundCurrently, there are no placenta-targeted treatments to alter the in utero environment. Water-soluble polymers have a distinguished record of clinical relevance outside of pregnancy. We have demonstrated the effective delivery of polymer-based nanoparticles containing a non-viral human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) transgene to correct placental insufficiency in small animal models of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Our goal was to extend these studies to the pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) and assess maternal, placental and fetal responses to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment. MethodsPregnant macaques underwent ultrasound-guided intraplacental injections of nanoparticles (GFP- or IGF1-expressing plasmid under the control of the trophoblast-specific PLAC1 promoter complexed with a HPMA-DMEAMA co-polymer) at approximately gestational day 100 (term = 165 days). Fetectomy was performed 24 h (GFP; n =1), 48 h (IGF1; n = 3) or 10 days (IGF1; n = 3) after nanoparticle delivery. Routine pathological assessment was performed on biopsied maternal tissues, and placental and fetal tissues. Maternal blood was analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), immunomodulatory proteins and growth factors, progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Placental ERK/AKT/mTOR signaling was assessed using western blot and qPCR. FindingsFluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization confirmed placental uptake and transgene expression in villous syncytiotrophoblast. No off-target expression was observed in maternal and fetal tissues. Histopathological assessment of the placenta recorded observations not necessarily related to the IGF1 nanoparticle treatment. In maternal blood, CBCs, P4 and E2 remained within the normal range for pregnant macaques across the treatment period. Changes to placental ERK and AKT signaling at 48 h and 10 d after IGF1 nanoparticle treatment indicated an upregulation in placental homeostatic mechanisms to prevent over activity in the normal pregnancy environment. InterpretationMaternal toxicity profile analysis and lack of adverse reaction to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment, combined with changes in placental signaling to maintain homeostasis indicates no deleterious impact of treatment.

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intermediary metabolites and flux through various pathways have emerged as key determinants of post-translational modifications. Independently, dynamic fluctuations in their concentrations are known to drive cellular energetics in a bi-directional manner. Notably, intracellular fatty acid pools that drastically change during fed and fasted states act as precursors for both ATP production and fatty acylation of proteins. Protein fatty acylation is well regarded for its role in regulating structure and functions of diverse proteins, however the effect of intracellular concentrations of fatty acids on protein modification is less understood. In this regard, we unequivocally demonstrate that metabolic contexts, viz. fed and fasted states, dictate the extent of global fatty acylation. Moreover, we show that presence or absence of glucose, that influences cellular and mitochondrial uptake/utilization of fatty acids, affects palmitoylation and oleoylation, which is consistent with their intracellular abundance in fed and fasted states. Employing complementary approaches including click-chemistry, lipidomics and imaging, we show the top-down control of cellular metabolic state. Importantly, our results establish the crucial role of mitochondria and retrograde signaling components like SIRT4, AMPK and mTOR in orchestrating protein fatty acylation at a whole cell level. Specifically, pharmacogenetic perturbations that alter either mitochondrial functions and/or retrograde signaling affect protein fatty acylation. Besides illustrating the cross-talk between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mediating bulk post-translational modification, our findings also highlight the involvement of mitochondrial energetics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is a stress-induced cytokine. Although the exact physiological function of GDF15 is not yet fully comprehended, the significant elevation of circulating GDF15 levels during gestation suggests a potential role for this hormone in pregnancy. This is corroborated by genetic association studies in which GDF15 and the GDF15 receptor, GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL) have been linked to morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) in humans. Here, we studied GDF15 biology during pregnancy in mice, rats, macaques, and humans. In contrast to macaques and humans, mice and rats exhibited an underwhelming induction in plasma GDF15 levels in response to pregnancy ([~]75-fold increase in macaques vs. [~]2-fold increase in rodents). The changes in circulating GDF15 levels were corroborated by the magnitude of Gdf15 mRNA and GDF15 protein expression in placentae from mice, rats, and macaques. These species-specific findings may help guide future studies focusing on GDF15 in pregnancy and on the evaluation of pharmacological strategies to interfere with GDF15-GFRAL signaling to treat severe nausea and HG.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The integrative response to exercise differs between sexes, with oxidative energy provision purported as a potential mechanism. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the kinetics of oxygen uptake ([V]O2) and extraction (HHb&#43;Mb) during exercise in both sexes. Sixteen young adults (8 females, age: 27{&#43;/-}5 years) completed three experimental visits. Incremental exercise testing was performed to obtain lactate threshold and [V]O2peak. Subsequent visits involved three six-minute cycling bouts at 80% of lactate threshold and one 30-minute bout at a work rate 30% between the lactate threshold and maximal ramp test power. Pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy continuously sampled [V]O2 and HHb&#43;Mb, respectively. The mean of six moderate and two heavy intensity transitions were modelled with mono-exponential curves to quantify the phase II response to exercise. Slow component amplitudes were also quantified for the heavy intensity domain. Males and females demonstrated similar relative [V]O2peak values (46.2{&#43;/-}6.6 vs 40.5{&#43;/-}6.7 ml.kg-1.min-1, p=0.111), with males achieving ~30% greater power outputs (p=0.002). In both the moderate and heavy intensity domains, the relative amplitude of the phase II transition was similar between sexes for [V]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.179) and HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.193). Similarly, there were no sex differences in the time constants for [V]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.385) or HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.274). In the heavy intensity domain, neither [V]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.686) or HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.432) slow component amplitudes were different between sexes. The oxidative response to moderate and heavy intensity exercise did not differ between males and females, suggesting both sexes experience similar degrees of bioenergetic stress during intensity-matched exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan via multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating by calcineurin inhibition mimics calorie restriction that results in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan enhancement by triggering lipolysis. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is required for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Episodic hypoglycemia is one of the best honed, evolutionary conserved phenomena in biology, because of the constant feast-fast cycles that have characterized most of history. The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, mobilizing substrate stores to produce glucose, is the primary adaptive mechanism to enable survival. Catecholamines and glucagon have long been considered the key hypoglycemia counterregulatory hormones, but here we identify a new hypoglycemia counterregulatory factor. We employed the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp to mimic the two common settings in which hypoglycemia can occur in patients: postprandial insulin overdose and elevated basal insulin administration, respectively. We found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) production is induced in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubules and its release increases hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing intrahepatic lipolysis in a beta-adrenergic receptor-2 (Adrb2)-dependent manner. In addition, mice exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia and patients with T1D exhibit impaired GDF15 production in the setting of hypoglycemia. These data demonstrate that GDF15 acts acutely as a gluco-counterregulatory hormone and identify a critical role for kidney-derived GDF15 in glucose homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) of the eye creates a chromatic blur on the retina that is an important cue for accommodation. While this mechanism can work optimally in broadband illuminants such as daylight, it is not clear how the system responds to the narrowband illuminants used by many modern displays. Here, we measured pupil and accommodative responses as well as visual acuity under narrowband LED illuminants of different peak wavelengths. Observers were able to accommodate under narrowband light and compensate for the LCA of the eye, with no difference in the variability of the steady-state accommodation response between narrowband and broadband illuminants. Intriguingly, our subjects compensated more fully for LCA at nearer distances. That is, the difference in accommodation to different wavelengths became larger when the object was placed nearer the observer, causing the slope of the accommodation response curve to become shallower for shorter wavelengths and steeper for longer ones. Within the accommodative range of observers, accommodative errors were small and visual acuity normal. When comparing between illuminants, when accommodation was accurate, visual acuity was worst for blue narrowband light. This cannot be due to the sparser spacing for S-cones, since our stimuli had equal luminance and thus activated M-cones roughly equally. It is likely because ocular LCA changes more rapidly at shorter wavelength, and so the finite spectral bandwidth of LEDs corresponds to a greater dioptric range at shorter wavelengths. This effect disappears for larger accommodative errors, due to the increased depth-of-focus of the eye.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A general tenet in stress physiology is that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis predominantly produces one glucocorticoid (GC) in response to stressors. Researchers typically measure only the GC believed to be dominant in their species of interest; however, the two main glucocorticoids produced by vertebrates- cortisol and corticosterone -- show variation across species in absolute levels, relative proportions, and stress responsivity. Therefore, generalizing assumptions and focusing on a single GC may not tell the whole story. In this study, we measured both cortisol and corticosterone in water samples collected from five species of Dendrobatid poison frogs. Understanding the full picture of the physiological stress response in poison frogs is of special interest due to their susceptibility to environmental stressors and conservation status. Counter to the dogma that corticosterone is dominant and more abundant in amphibians, we found cortisol was more abundant than corticosterone in four of the five species. Dendrobates tinctorius was unique in releasing equal amounts of cortisol and corticosterone. When we stimulated the HPA axis in D. tinctorius, we found corticosterone was responsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), while cortisol did not change. Comparing plasma and water samples, we found water-borne cortisol was positively correlated with cortisol in plasma and the relationship between plasma and water-borne corticosterone was positive but not statistically significant. These results challenge the broadly accepted assumption that corticosterone is  dominant in amphibians and add to the growing literature highlighting the importance of measuring both GCs to understand (stress) physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Efficient and accurate methods to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI) and beta-cell function (BCF) are of great importance for studying the pathogenesis and treatment effectiveness of type 2 diabetes. Many methods exist, ranging in input data and technical requirements. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are preferred because they are simpler and more physiological. However, current analytical methods for OGTT-derived SI and BCF also range in complexity; the oral minimal models require mathematical expertise for deconvolution and fitting differential equations, and simple algebraic models (e.g., Matsuda index, insulinogenic index) may produce unphysiological values. We developed a new ISS (Insulin Secretion and Sensitivity) model for clinical research that provides precise and accurate estimates of SI and BCF from a standard OGTT, focusing on effectiveness, ease of implementation, and pragmatism. The model was developed by fitting a pair of differential equations to glucose and insulin without need of deconvolution or C-peptide data. The model is derived from a published model for longitudinal simulation of T2D progression that represents glucose-insulin homeostasis, including post-challenge suppression of hepatic glucose production and first- and second-phase insulin secretion. The ISS model was evaluated in three diverse cohorts including individuals at high risk of prediabetes (adult women with a wide range of BMI and adolescents with obesity). The new model had strong correlation with gold-standard estimates from intravenous glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The ISS model has broad clinical applicability among diverse populations because it balances performance, fidelity, and complexity to provide a reliable phenotype of T2D risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCurrently, there are no placenta-targeted treatments to alter the in utero environment. Water-soluble polymers have a distinguished record of clinical relevance outside of pregnancy. We have demonstrated the effective delivery of polymer-based nanoparticles containing a non-viral human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) transgene to correct placental insufficiency in small animal models of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Our goal was to extend these studies to the pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) and assess maternal, placental and fetal responses to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment.

MethodsPregnant macaques underwent ultrasound-guided intraplacental injections of nanoparticles (GFP- or IGF1-expressing plasmid under the control of the trophoblast-specific PLAC1 promoter complexed with a HPMA-DMEAMA co-polymer) at approximately gestational day 100 (term = 165 days). Fetectomy was performed 24 h (GFP; n =1), 48 h (IGF1; n = 3) or 10 days (IGF1; n = 3) after nanoparticle delivery. Routine pathological assessment was performed on biopsied maternal tissues, and placental and fetal tissues. Maternal blood was analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), immunomodulatory proteins and growth factors, progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Placental ERK/AKT/mTOR signaling was assessed using western blot and qPCR.

FindingsFluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization confirmed placental uptake and transgene expression in villous syncytiotrophoblast. No off-target expression was observed in maternal and fetal tissues. Histopathological assessment of the placenta recorded observations not necessarily related to the IGF1 nanoparticle treatment. In maternal blood, CBCs, P4 and E2 remained within the normal range for pregnant macaques across the treatment period. Changes to placental ERK and AKT signaling at 48 h and 10 d after IGF1 nanoparticle treatment indicated an upregulation in placental homeostatic mechanisms to prevent over activity in the normal pregnancy environment.

InterpretationMaternal toxicity profile analysis and lack of adverse reaction to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment, combined with changes in placental signaling to maintain homeostasis indicates no deleterious impact of treatment.
