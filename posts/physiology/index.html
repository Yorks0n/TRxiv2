This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis. Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.\nCardiac Localized Polycystin-2 plays a Functional Role in Natriuretic Peptide Production and its Absence Contributes to Hypertension\nAuthors: Elliott, B.; Marquez-Nogueraz, K. M.; Thuo, P.; DiNello, E.; Knutila, R. M.; Fritzmann, G. E.; Willis, M.; Chapman, A. B.; Cao, Q.; Barefield, D. Y.; Kuo, I. Y.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573922\nCardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hypertension is seen in 70% of patients by the age of 30 prior to decline in kidney function. The natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released by cardiomyocytes in response to membrane stretch, increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. Mice heterozygous for Pkd2 have attenuated NP responses and we hypothesized that cardiomyocyte-localized polycystin proteins contribute to production of NPs. Cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out models of polycystin-2 (PC2), one of the causative genes of ADPKD, demonstrate diurnal hypertension. These mice have decreased ANP and BNP expression in the left ventricle. Analysis of the pathways involved in production, maturation, and activity of NPs identified decreased transcription of CgB, PCSK6, and NFAT genes in cPC2-KOs. Engineered heart tissue with human iPSCs driven into cardiomyocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 KO of PKD2 failed to produce ANP. These results suggest that PC2 in cardiomyocytes are involved in NP production and lack of cardiac PC2 predisposes to a hypertensive volume expanded phenotype, which may contribute to the development of hypertension in ADPKD.\nHistone Deacetylase Inhibitors Prevent Cytokine-Induced β Cell Dysfunction Through Restoration of Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 Expression and Activation of Store-Operated Calcium Entry\nAuthors: Lee, C.-C.; Kono, T. M.; Syed, F.; Weaver, S. A.; Sohn, P.; Wu, W.; Chang, G.; Liu, J.; Rupnik, M. S.; Evans-Molina, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570443\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) modulate {beta} cell function in preclinical models of diabetes; however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects have not been determined. In this study, we investigated the impact of the HDI sodium butyrate (NaB) on {beta} cell function and calcium (Ca2+) signaling using ex vivo and in vitro models of diabetes. Our results show that NaB significantly improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets from human organ donors with type 2 diabetes and in cytokine-treated INS-1 {beta} cells. Consistently, NaB partially rescued glucose-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations in mouse islets treated with proinflammatory cytokines. Because the oscillatory phenotype of Ca2+ in the {beta} cell is governed by changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ levels, next we explored the relationship between NaB and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a rescue mechanism that acts to refill ER Ca2+ levels through STIM1-mediated gating of plasmalemmal Orai channels. We found that NaB treatment preserved basal ER Ca2+ levels and restored SOCE in IL-1{beta}-treated INS-1 cells. Furthermore, we linked these changes with the restoration of STIM1 levels in cytokine-treated INS-1 cells and mouse islets, and we found that NaB treatment was sufficient to prevent {beta} cell death in response to IL-1{beta} treatment. Mechanistically, NaB counteracted cytokine-mediated reductions in phosphorylation levels of key signaling molecules, including AKT, ERK1/2, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and GSK-3{beta}. Taken together, these data support a model whereby HDI treatment promotes {beta} cell function and Ca2+ homeostasis under proinflammatory conditions through STIM1-mediated control of SOCE and AKT-mediated inhibition of GSK-3.\n3D-Printable Non-invasive Head Immobilization System for Non-Human Primates\nAuthors: Shahbazi, E.; Swedan, T.; Ma, T.; Lafer-Sousa, R.; Azadi, R.; Nguyen, D.; Ryan, A.; Afraz, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573832\nWe introduce a novel 3D-printed non-invasive head immobilization system (NHIS) for macaque monkeys, addressing the limitations of traditional head fixation methods in behavioral experiments. Traditional techniques, crucial for precise eye movement tracking and neural recording, often lead to biological complications like infection and bone softening. Our innovative NHIS, designed using CT/MRI scans and custom software FLoRIN, offers a tailored, comfortable fit for each subject. It accommodates essential experimental equipment such as eye-tracking and physiological monitoring devices, providing a more adaptable and efficient alternative for nonhuman primate research.\nDietary methionine/choline deficiency affects behavioural and molecular circadian rhythms\nAuthors: Saer, B.; Taylor, G.; Hayes, A.; Ananthasubramaniam, B.; Fustin, J.-M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574014\nThe feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders. Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis. We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hypertension is seen in 70% of patients by the age of 30 prior to decline in kidney function. The natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released by cardiomyocytes in response to membrane stretch, increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. Mice heterozygous for Pkd2 have attenuated NP responses and we hypothesized that cardiomyocyte-localized polycystin proteins contribute to production of NPs. Cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out models of polycystin-2 (PC2), one of the causative genes of ADPKD, demonstrate diurnal hypertension. These mice have decreased ANP and BNP expression in the left ventricle. Analysis of the pathways involved in production, maturation, and activity of NPs identified decreased transcription of CgB, PCSK6, and NFAT genes in cPC2-KOs. Engineered heart tissue with human iPSCs driven into cardiomyocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 KO of PKD2 failed to produce ANP. These results suggest that PC2 in cardiomyocytes are involved in NP production and lack of cardiac PC2 predisposes to a hypertensive volume expanded phenotype, which may contribute to the development of hypertension in ADPKD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) modulate {beta} cell function in preclinical models of diabetes; however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects have not been determined. In this study, we investigated the impact of the HDI sodium butyrate (NaB) on {beta} cell function and calcium (Ca2&#43;) signaling using ex vivo and in vitro models of diabetes. Our results show that NaB significantly improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets from human organ donors with type 2 diabetes and in cytokine-treated INS-1 {beta} cells. Consistently, NaB partially rescued glucose-stimulated Ca2&#43; oscillations in mouse islets treated with proinflammatory cytokines. Because the oscillatory phenotype of Ca2&#43; in the {beta} cell is governed by changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2&#43; levels, next we explored the relationship between NaB and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a rescue mechanism that acts to refill ER Ca2&#43; levels through STIM1-mediated gating of plasmalemmal Orai channels. We found that NaB treatment preserved basal ER Ca2&#43; levels and restored SOCE in IL-1{beta}-treated INS-1 cells. Furthermore, we linked these changes with the restoration of STIM1 levels in cytokine-treated INS-1 cells and mouse islets, and we found that NaB treatment was sufficient to prevent {beta} cell death in response to IL-1{beta} treatment. Mechanistically, NaB counteracted cytokine-mediated reductions in phosphorylation levels of key signaling molecules, including AKT, ERK1/2, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and GSK-3{beta}. Taken together, these data support a model whereby HDI treatment promotes {beta} cell function and Ca2&#43; homeostasis under proinflammatory conditions through STIM1-mediated control of SOCE and AKT-mediated inhibition of GSK-3.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce a novel 3D-printed non-invasive head immobilization system (NHIS) for macaque monkeys, addressing the limitations of traditional head fixation methods in behavioral experiments. Traditional techniques, crucial for precise eye movement tracking and neural recording, often lead to biological complications like infection and bone softening. Our innovative NHIS, designed using CT/MRI scans and custom software FLoRIN, offers a tailored, comfortable fit for each subject. It accommodates essential experimental equipment such as eye-tracking and physiological monitoring devices, providing a more adaptable and efficient alternative for nonhuman primate research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders.

Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis.

We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.</p>
