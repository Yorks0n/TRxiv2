Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases and is also necessary to promote tumour growth. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT) shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF41-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.\nBeyond Myosin Heavy Chains: Ribosomal Specialization Drives Human Skeletal Muscle Fiber Heterogeneity\nAuthors: Moreno-Justicia, R.; Van der Stede, T.; Stocks, B.; Laitila, J.; Seaborne, R. A.; Van de Loock, A.; Lievens, E.; Marin-Arraiza, L.; Van Vossel, K.; Yigit, N.; Anckaert, J.; Weyns, A.; Van Thienen, R.; Sahl, R. E.; Zanoteli, E.; Lawlor, M. W.; Mestdagh, P.; Vandesompele, J.; Ochala, J.; Hostrup, M.; Derave, W.; Deshmukh, A. S.\nScore: 54.6, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.

L.; Fuller, A. D.; Parham, L. R.; Panchani, S. R.; Natarajan, S.; Jackson, J. L.; Mu, A.; Tan, Y.; Cai, K. Q.; Klein-Szanto, A.; Muir, A. B.; Tetreault, M.-P.; Hamilton, K. E.; Whelan, K. A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558614\nBackground \u0026 Aims: Autophagy has been demonstrated to play roles in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Here, we aim to define the role of autophagy in esophageal epithelium under homeostatic conditions. Methods: We generated tamoxifen-inducible, squamous epithelial-specific Atg7 (autophagy related 7) conditional knockout mice to evaluate effects on esophageal homeostasis and response to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) using histological and biochemical analyses. We FACS sorted esophageal basal cells based upon fluorescence of the autophagic vesicle (AV)-identifying dye Cyto-ID, then subjected these cells to transmission electron microscopy, image flow cytometry, 3D organoid assays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and cell cycle analysis. 3D organoids were subjected to passaging, single cell (sc) RNA-Seq, cell cycle analysis, and immunostaining. Results: Genetic autophagy inhibition in squamous epithelium resulted in increased proliferation of esophageal basal cells. Esophageal basal cells with high AV level (Cyto-IDHigh) displayed limited organoid formation capability upon initial plating but passaged more efficiently than their counterparts with low AV level (Cyto-IDLow). RNA-Seq suggested increased autophagy in Cyto-IDHigh esophageal basal cells along with decreased cell cycle progression, the latter of which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. scRNA-Seq of 3D organoids generated by Cyto-IDLow and Cyto-IDHigh cells identified expansion of 3 cell populations, enrichment of G2/M-associated genes, and aberrant localization of cell cycle-associated genes beyond basal cell populations in the Cyto-IDHigh group. Ki67 expression was also increased in organoids generated by Cyto-IDHigh cells, including in cells beyond the basal cell layer. Squamous epithelial-specific autophagy inhibition induced significant weight loss in mice treated with 4NQO that further displayed perturbed epithelial tissue architecture. Conclusions: High AV level identifies esophageal epithelium with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal capacity that contributes to maintenance of the esophageal proliferation-differentiation gradient in vivo.\nResidual force depression is not related to positive muscle fascicle work during submaximal voluntary dorsiflexion contractions in humans\nAuthors: Raiteri, B. J.; Lauret, L.; Hahn, D.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557211\nResidual force depression (rFD) following active muscle shortening is commonly assumed to strongly and linearly increase with increasing muscle work, but this has not been systematically tested during voluntary contractions in humans. Using dynamometry, we compared steady-state ankle joint torques (N=16) following tibialis anterior (TA) muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening and shortening to the torque during submaximal voluntary fixed-end dorsiflexion reference contractions (REF) at a matched MTU length and EMG amplitude. B-mode ultrasound revealed that TA fascicle shortening amplitudes were significantly reduced (p\u003c0.001) during MTU lengthening with no preload over small (LENsmall) and medium (LENmedium) amplitudes, respectively, relative to REF. MTU lengthening with a preload over a large (LENlargeP) amplitude significantly (p\u003c0.001) increased fascicle shortening relative to REF, as well as stretch amplitudes relative to LENsmall and LENmedium (p[\u0026le;]0.001), but the significant (p[\u0026le;]0.028) steady-state fascicle force enhancement relative to REF was similar to LENsmall and LENmedium (3-5%). MTU shortening with and without a preload over small (SHOsmallP/SHOsmall) and large (SHOlargeP/SHOlarge) amplitudes significantly (p\u003c0.001) increased positive fascicle and MTU work relative to REF, but significant (p[\u0026le;]0.006) rFD was observed in SHOsmallP and SHOlargeP (7-10%) only. rFD was linearly related to positive MTU work (rrm(47)=0.48, p\u003c0.001), but not positive fascicle work (rrm(47)=0.16, p=0.277). Our findings indicate that MTU lengthening without substantial fascicle stretch enhances steady-state force output, which might be due to less shortening-induced rFD. Our findings also indicate that different amounts of positive fascicle and MTU work induce similar rFD, which cautions against using work to predict rFD during submaximal voluntary contractions.\nCalcium-dependent transcriptional profiles of human pancreatic islet cells reveal functional diversity in islet subpopulations\nAuthors: Yoon, J. S.; Sasaki, S.; Velghe, J.; Zosel, K.; Lee, M. Y. Y.; Winata, H.; Nian, C.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556709\nAims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity. MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells. ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function. ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

J.; Sexton, C. L.; Wolff, C. A.; Viggars, M. R.; Esser, K. A.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.557933\nTime-of-day differences in acute exercise performance in mice are well established with late active phase (afternoon) runners exhibiting significantly greater endurance performance compared to early active phase (morning) runners. In this study, we asked if performance adaptations would be different when training for 6 weeks at two different times of day, and if this corresponds to steady state changes in the phase of peripheral tissue clocks. To address these questions, we endurance trained female PER2::Luciferase mice, at the same relative workload, either in the morning, at ZT13, or in the afternoon, at ZT22. Then, after training, we recorded luminescence from tissues of PER2::Luciferase mice to report timing of tissue clocks in several peripheral tissues. After 6 weeks, we found that both groups exhibited significant improvements in maximal endurance capacity (total treadmill work)(p \u003c 0.0001), but the morning runners exhibited an enhanced rate of adaptation as there was no detectable difference in maximal endurance capacity (p = 0.2182) between the morning and afternoon runners. In addition, morning and afternoon runners exhibited divergent clock phase shifts with a significant 5-hour phase advance in the EDL (p \u003c 0.0001) and soleus (p \u003c 0.0001) of morning runners, but a phase delay in the EDL (p \u003c 0.0001) and Soleus (p \u003c 0.0001) of afternoon runners. Therefore, our data demonstrate that morning training enhances endurance adaptations compared to afternoon training in mice, and we suggest this is due to phase advancement of muscle clocks to better align metabolism with exercise performance. Key points summaryO_LITime-of-day differences in exercise performance are well established in the literature. We observe that after 6 weeks of endurance exercise training there is no longer a time-of-day specific difference in endurance performance. C_LIO_LIConsistent endurance training performed in morning (ZT13) results in a greater performance increase compared to exercise training during the afternoon (ZT22). C_LIO_LIRemoval of time-of-day differences in performance through exercise training is strongly associated with significant phase shifts (~5 hour advance) of the muscle clock.

AAA rupture has a devastating 80% mortality rate and there is no treatment to slow-down AAA progression. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a ubiquitous redox-modifying gasotransmitter produced in the cardiovascular system via the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway by cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE). H2S has protective properties on the cardiovascular system, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Here, we hypothesized that sodium thiosulfate (STS), a clinically relevant source of H2S, would limit AAA growth. Methods8-12 weeks old male WT or Cse-/- mice on a C57BL/6J genetic background were submitted to a model of AAA by topical elastase application on the abdominal aorta and {beta}-aminopropionitrile fumarate treatment in the drinking water for 2 weeks post-op. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) was given via the drinking water post-op until aorta collection. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the effect of STS and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 {beta} and 6 and tumor necrosis factor on primary human vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). ResultsSurprisingly, STS increased elastin degradation, AAA size and rupture, despite reducing infiltration of macrophages, antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes in WT mice. Conversely, Cse-/- mice with impaired H2S production developed smaller AAA than WT mice despite increased infiltration of immune cells. STS reduced VSMC coverage, possibly lowered VSMC proliferation, and promoted VSMC loss and extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown. In vitro, STS aggravated pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced VSMCs apoptosis. ConclusionSTS has a paradoxical effect on AAA growth, reducing inflammation while simultaneously impeding favorable vascular remodeling, resulting in bigger AAA in a model of periadventitial elastase. This study identifies a negative effect of H2S on VSMC in this environment, highlighting the complex role of H2S in AAA progression. The deleterious effect of STS on AAA progression is significant, especially given the growing use of STS in clinical settings for various indications.\nBreeding for growth has resulted in increased tolerance to drought at the cost of genetic diversity in Scots pine.\nAuthors: Munoz, F. G.; Hayatgheibi, h.; Niemi, J.; Ostlund, L.; Garcia-Gil, M. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557809\nClimate change possess a threat to forests and forestry. Drought has been identified as a one of the main issues due to its interaction with other biotic and abiotic stresses. Few studies have been done regarding breeding effect on the adaptability to climate change. After a common garden experiment with seedling families of Scots pine from northern Sweden, we have found differences in drought tolerance between families of breeding and natural origin. We performed a high throughput analysis-based phenotyping on both canopy and root traits. Root architecture traits might be related to drought tolerance and show moderate to high heritability values. The heritability of root architecture traits can be useful not only for drought but also for adaptability to other abiotic stresses. Analysis on architecture traits show that, especially on canopy-traits, families from breeding origins show less phenotypic variance than the ones from natural origins. The methodology employed to evaluate drought tolerance and plant architecture might be useful for future research and forest management focused on climate change adaptability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases and is also necessary to promote tumour growth. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT) shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF41-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; Aims: Autophagy has been demonstrated to play roles in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Here, we aim to define the role of autophagy in esophageal epithelium under homeostatic conditions. Methods: We generated tamoxifen-inducible, squamous epithelial-specific Atg7 (autophagy related 7) conditional knockout mice to evaluate effects on esophageal homeostasis and response to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) using histological and biochemical analyses. We FACS sorted esophageal basal cells based upon fluorescence of the autophagic vesicle (AV)-identifying dye Cyto-ID, then subjected these cells to transmission electron microscopy, image flow cytometry, 3D organoid assays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and cell cycle analysis. 3D organoids were subjected to passaging, single cell (sc) RNA-Seq, cell cycle analysis, and immunostaining. Results: Genetic autophagy inhibition in squamous epithelium resulted in increased proliferation of esophageal basal cells. Esophageal basal cells with high AV level (Cyto-IDHigh) displayed limited organoid formation capability upon initial plating but passaged more efficiently than their counterparts with low AV level (Cyto-IDLow). RNA-Seq suggested increased autophagy in Cyto-IDHigh esophageal basal cells along with decreased cell cycle progression, the latter of which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. scRNA-Seq of 3D organoids generated by Cyto-IDLow and Cyto-IDHigh cells identified expansion of 3 cell populations, enrichment of G2/M-associated genes, and aberrant localization of cell cycle-associated genes beyond basal cell populations in the Cyto-IDHigh group. Ki67 expression was also increased in organoids generated by Cyto-IDHigh cells, including in cells beyond the basal cell layer. Squamous epithelial-specific autophagy inhibition induced significant weight loss in mice treated with 4NQO that further displayed perturbed epithelial tissue architecture. Conclusions: High AV level identifies esophageal epithelium with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal capacity that contributes to maintenance of the esophageal proliferation-differentiation gradient in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Residual force depression (rFD) following active muscle shortening is commonly assumed to strongly and linearly increase with increasing muscle work, but this has not been systematically tested during voluntary contractions in humans. Using dynamometry, we compared steady-state ankle joint torques (N=16) following tibialis anterior (TA) muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengthening and shortening to the torque during submaximal voluntary fixed-end dorsiflexion reference contractions (REF) at a matched MTU length and EMG amplitude. B-mode ultrasound revealed that TA fascicle shortening amplitudes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001) during MTU lengthening with no preload over small (LENsmall) and medium (LENmedium) amplitudes, respectively, relative to REF. MTU lengthening with a preload over a large (LENlargeP) amplitude significantly (p&lt;0.001) increased fascicle shortening relative to REF, as well as stretch amplitudes relative to LENsmall and LENmedium (p[&amp;le;]0.001), but the significant (p[&amp;le;]0.028) steady-state fascicle force enhancement relative to REF was similar to LENsmall and LENmedium (3-5%). MTU shortening with and without a preload over small (SHOsmallP/SHOsmall) and large (SHOlargeP/SHOlarge) amplitudes significantly (p&lt;0.001) increased positive fascicle and MTU work relative to REF, but significant (p[&amp;le;]0.006) rFD was observed in SHOsmallP and SHOlargeP (7-10%) only. rFD was linearly related to positive MTU work (rrm(47)=0.48, p&lt;0.001), but not positive fascicle work (rrm(47)=0.16, p=0.277). Our findings indicate that MTU lengthening without substantial fascicle stretch enhances steady-state force output, which might be due to less shortening-induced rFD. Our findings also indicate that different amounts of positive fascicle and MTU work induce similar rFD, which cautions against using work to predict rFD during submaximal voluntary contractions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity.

MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.

ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.

ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

        <p class="abstract">Time-of-day differences in acute exercise performance in mice are well established with late active phase (afternoon) runners exhibiting significantly greater endurance performance compared to early active phase (morning) runners. In this study, we asked if performance adaptations would be different when training for 6 weeks at two different times of day, and if this corresponds to steady state changes in the phase of peripheral tissue clocks. To address these questions, we endurance trained female PER2::Luciferase mice, at the same relative workload, either in the morning, at ZT13, or in the afternoon, at ZT22. Then, after training, we recorded luminescence from tissues of PER2::Luciferase mice to report timing of tissue clocks in several peripheral tissues. After 6 weeks, we found that both groups exhibited significant improvements in maximal endurance capacity (total treadmill work)(p &lt; 0.0001), but the morning runners exhibited an enhanced rate of adaptation as there was no detectable difference in maximal endurance capacity (p = 0.2182) between the morning and afternoon runners. In addition, morning and afternoon runners exhibited divergent clock phase shifts with a significant 5-hour phase advance in the EDL (p &lt; 0.0001) and soleus (p &lt; 0.0001) of morning runners, but a phase delay in the EDL (p &lt; 0.0001) and Soleus (p &lt; 0.0001) of afternoon runners. Therefore, our data demonstrate that morning training enhances endurance adaptations compared to afternoon training in mice, and we suggest this is due to phase advancement of muscle clocks to better align metabolism with exercise performance.

Key points summaryO_LITime-of-day differences in exercise performance are well established in the literature. We observe that after 6 weeks of endurance exercise training there is no longer a time-of-day specific difference in endurance performance.
C_LIO_LIConsistent endurance training performed in morning (ZT13) results in a greater performance increase compared to exercise training during the afternoon (ZT22).
C_LIO_LIRemoval of time-of-day differences in performance through exercise training is strongly associated with significant phase shifts (~5 hour advance) of the muscle clock.

        <p class="abstract">IntroThe prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is constantly progressing with the aging of the global population. AAA rupture has a devastating 80% mortality rate and there is no treatment to slow-down AAA progression. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a ubiquitous redox-modifying gasotransmitter produced in the cardiovascular system via the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway by cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE). H2S has protective properties on the cardiovascular system, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Here, we hypothesized that sodium thiosulfate (STS), a clinically relevant source of H2S, would limit AAA growth.

Methods8-12 weeks old male WT or Cse-/- mice on a C57BL/6J genetic background were submitted to a model of AAA by topical elastase application on the abdominal aorta and {beta}-aminopropionitrile fumarate treatment in the drinking water for 2 weeks post-op. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) was given via the drinking water post-op until aorta collection. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the effect of STS and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 {beta} and 6 and tumor necrosis factor  on primary human vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC).

ResultsSurprisingly, STS increased elastin degradation, AAA size and rupture, despite reducing infiltration of macrophages, antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes in WT mice. Conversely, Cse-/- mice with impaired H2S production developed smaller AAA than WT mice despite increased infiltration of immune cells. STS reduced VSMC coverage, possibly lowered VSMC proliferation, and promoted VSMC loss and extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown. In vitro, STS aggravated pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced VSMCs apoptosis.

ConclusionSTS has a paradoxical effect on AAA growth, reducing inflammation while simultaneously impeding favorable vascular remodeling, resulting in bigger AAA in a model of periadventitial elastase. This study identifies a negative effect of H2S on VSMC in this environment, highlighting the complex role of H2S in AAA progression. The deleterious effect of STS on AAA progression is significant, especially given the growing use of STS in clinical settings for various indications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Climate change possess a threat to forests and forestry. Drought has been identified as a one of the main issues due to its interaction with other biotic and abiotic stresses. Few studies have been done regarding breeding effect on the adaptability to climate change. After a common garden experiment with seedling families of Scots pine from northern Sweden, we have found differences in drought tolerance between families of breeding and natural origin. We performed a high throughput analysis-based phenotyping on both canopy and root traits. Root architecture traits might be related to drought tolerance and show moderate to high heritability values. The heritability of root architecture traits can be useful not only for drought but also for adaptability to other abiotic stresses. Analysis on architecture traits show that, especially on canopy-traits, families from breeding origins show less phenotypic variance than the ones from natural origins. The methodology employed to evaluate drought tolerance and plant architecture might be useful for future research and forest management focused on climate change adaptability.</p>
