C.\nScore: 43.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547547\nLoss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.\nInhibition of skeletal muscle Lands cycle ameliorates weakness induced by physical inactivity\nAuthors: Shahtout, J. L.; Eshima, H.; Ferrara, P. J.; Maschek, J. A.; Cox, J. E.; Drummond, M. J.; Funai, K.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550576\nLipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) have been implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy with age and disuse. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an enzyme of Lands cycle, conjugates a polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain to a lysophospholipid (PUFA-PL) molecule, providing substrates for LOOH propagation. Previous studies suggest that inhibition of Lands cycle is an effective strategy to suppress LOOH. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific tamoxifen-inducible knockout of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKO) were utilized to determine if muscle-specific attenuation of LOOH may alleviate muscle atrophy and weakness with disuse. LPCAT3-MKO and control mice underwent 7 days of sham or hindlimb unloading (HU model) to study muscle mass and force-generating capacity. LOOH was assessed by quantifying 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-conjugated peptides. Quantitative PCR and lipid mass spectrometry were used to validate LPCAT3 deletion. 7 days of HU was sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and weakness concomitant to an increase in 4-HNE. Deletion of LPCAT3 reversed HU-induced increase in muscle 4HNE. No difference was found in body mass, body composition, or caloric intake between genotypes. The soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PLANT) muscles of the LPCAT3-MKO mice were partially protected from atrophy compared to controls, concomitant to attenuated decrease in cross-sectional areas in type I and IIa fibers. Strikingly, SOL and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were robustly protected from HU-induced reduction in force-generating capacity in the LPCAT3-MKO mice compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate that attenuation of muscle LOOH is sufficient to restore skeletal muscle function, in particular a protection from reduction in muscle specific force. Thus, muscle LOOH contributes to atrophy and weakness induced by HU in mice.\nCellular traits regulate fluorescence-based bio-optical phenotypes of coral photosymbionts living in-hospite\nAuthors: McQuagge, A.; Pahl, K. B.; Wong, S.; Melman, T.; Linn, L.; Lowry, S.; Hoadley, K.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547959\nAbstractDiversity across algal family Symbiodiniaceae contributes to the environmental resilience of certain coral species. Chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements are frequently used to determine symbiont health and resilience, but more work is needed to refine these tools and establish how they relate to underlying cellular traits. We examined trait diversity in symbionts from the generas Cladocopium and Durusdinium, collected from 12 aquacultured coral species. Photophysiological metrics ({Phi}PSII, {sigma}PSII, {rho}, {tau}1, {tau}2, ABQ, NPQ, and qP) were assessed using a prototype multi-spectral fluorometer over a variable light protocol which yielded a total of 1360 individual metrics. Photophysiological metrics were then used to establish four unique phenotypic variants. Corals harboring C15 were predominantly found within a single phenotype which clustered separately from all other coral fragments. The majority of Durusdinium dominated colonies also formed a separate phenotype which it shared with a few C1 dominated corals. C15 and D1 symbionts appear to differ in which mechanisms they employ to dissipate excess light energy. Spectrally dependent variability is also observed across phenotypes that may relate to differences in photopigment utilization. Cell physiology (atomic C:N:P, cell size, chlorophyll-a, neutral lipid content) was also assessed within each sample and differ across phenotypes, linking photophysiological metrics with underlying primary cellular traits. Strong correlations between first- and second-order traits, such as Quantum Yield and cellular N:P content, or light dissipation pathways (qP and NPQ) and C:P underline differences across symbiont types and may also provide a means for using fluorescence-based metrics as biomarkers for certain primary-cellular traits.\nA temperature-controlled, circular maintenance system for studying growth and development of pelagic tunicates (Salps)\nAuthors: Mueller, S. J.; Wessels, W.; Driscoll, S.; Pakhomov, E. A.; Auerswald, L.; Michael, K.; Meyer, B.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.547827\nSalps are pelagic tunicates that are able to form large blooms under favorable conditions by alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction. While their role in the regional carbon cycle is receiving attention, our knowledge of their physiology is still limited. This knowledge gap is mainly due to their fragile gelatinous nature, which makes it difficult to capture intact specimens and maintain them in the laboratory. We present here a modified kreisel tank system, that was tested onboard using the Southern Ocean salp Salpa thompsoni and station-based using the Mediterranean species Salpa fusiformis. Successful maintenance over days to weeks allowed us to obtain comparable relative growth and developmental rates as in situ, and provided insight into their potential life cycle strategies. By providing a starting point for successful maintenance, we hope to stimulate future experimental research on this understudied taxonomic group.\nVhl deletion in Dmp1-expressing cells alters MEP metabolism and promotes stress erythropoiesis\nAuthors: Emery, J. M.; Chicana, B.; Taglinao, H.; Ponce, C.; Donham, C.; Padmore, H.; Sebastian, A.; Trasti, S. L.; Manilay, J. O.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550559\nIn recent years, general hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzyme inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia due to renal disease and osteoporosis. However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis.\nCircadian proteomics reveal rampant tuning of post-transcriptional apparatus by Chlamydomonas clock\nAuthors: Jadhav, D. B.; Roy, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550970\nTiming of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earth's rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often don't concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified \u003e1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, \u003e40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and \u003e 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonas's unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.\nIdentifying novel links between cardiovascular disease and insomnia by Drosophila modeling of genes from a pleiotropic GWAS locus\nAuthors: Melkani, G. C.; Abou Daya, F.; Ober, L.; Patel, D.; Mandigo, T.; Maher, M.; Tchio, C.; Walker, J. A.; Saxena, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550429\nBackgroundInsomnia symptoms have been associated with CVD, doubling the risk of incident CVD, but specific shared pathways remain poorly understood. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic loci significantly associated with insomnia symptoms, including one locus that was previously associated with CVD in an independent GWAS. MethodsTo evaluate the cell-autonomous role of genes near the CVD- and insomnia-related locus, we used Drosophila melanogaster models to perform tissue-specific RNAi knockdown of these genes in the heart and neurons. We also performed suppression of these genes in the heart or neurons, and assessed sleep or cardiac function, respectively, to identify non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. ResultsOur results show that neuronal and cardiac-specific RNAi knockdown of four genes conserved in Drosophila, Lsn, ATPSynC, Bruce, and Imp, contributes to compromised sleep and cardiac performance, respectively. Cardiac-specific knockdown of Lsn led to significant cardiac dilation and reduced cardiac performance. Knockdown of ATPSynC led to significantly reduced cardiac performance without dilations. Furthermore, Lsn and ATPSynC-suppressed hearts showed disruption in the actin-containing myofibrillar organization and led to a significantly shortened lifespan. Suppression of Lsn increased pericardin deposition, indicative of a fibrotic phenotype. Neuronal-specific knockdown of ATPSynC, Imp, and Lsn led to compromised sleep. Moreover, the knockdown of Imp in the brain led to a significantly compromised cardiac function characterized by decreased systolic and diastolic intervals and fractional shortening in a non-cell autonomous manner. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bruce, ATPSynC, and Lsn in the heart led to compromised sleep characterized by decreased activity and daytime activity and increased bin number in a non-cell autonomous manner. ConclusionsOur study provides novel insights into genetic mechanisms linking CVD and insomnia, highlighting the importance of these four conserved genes in the development and association of both diseases.\nKCNQ5 controls perivascular adipose tissue-mediated vasodilation\nAuthors: Tsvetkov, D.; Schleifenbaum, J.; Wang, Y.; Kassmann, M.; Polovitskaya, M.; Schütze, S.; Rothe, M.; Luft, F. C.; Jentsch, T. J.; Gollasch, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550617\nBackground: Small arteries exhibit resting tone, a partially contracted state that maintains arterial blood pressure. In arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), potassium channels control contraction and relaxation. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been shown to exert anticontractile effects on the blood vessels. However, the mechanisms by which PVAT signals small arteries, and their relevance, remain largely unknown. We aimed to uncover key molecular components in adipose-vascular coupling. Methods: A wide-spectrum of genetic mouse models targeting Kcnq3, Kcnq4 and Kcnq5 genes (Kcnq3-/-, Kcnq4-/-, Kcnq5-/-, Kcnq5dn/dn, Kcnq4-/-/Kcnq5dn/dn, Kcnq4-/-/Kcnq5-/-), telemetry blood pressure measurements, targeted lipidomics, and RNA-Seq profiling, wire-myography, patch-clamp, and sharp-electrode membrane potential measurements were used. Results: We show that PVAT causes SMC KCNQ5 (KV7.5) channels to hyperpolarize the membrane potential. This effect relaxes small arteries and regulates blood pressure. Oxygenation of polyunsaturated fats generates oxylipins, a superclass of lipid mediators. We identified numerous oxylipins released by PVAT that potentiate vasodilatory action in small arteries by opening SMC KCNQ5 channels. Conclusions: Our results reveal a key molecular function of KCNQ5 channels in adipose-vascular coupling, translating PVAT signals, particularly oxylipins, to the central physiological function of vasoregulation. This novel pathway opens new therapeutic perspectives.\nThe influence of carbon dioxide on cerebral metabolism and oxygen consumption: combining multimodal monitoring with dynamic systems modelling\nAuthors: Highton, D.; Caldwell, M.; Tachtsidis, I.; Elwell, C. E.; Smith, M.; Cooper, C. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550309\nHypercapnia increases cerebral blood flow, but the effect on cerebral metabolism in humans remains incompletely understood. Either increased or reduced oxygen consumption has been predicted from Fick models incorporating cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood flow. Hypercapnia also results in oxidation of cytochrome c oxidase, complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, implicating a change in cellular metabolism. The aim of this study was to combine systems modelling with non-invasive measurements of cerebral tissue oxygenation, cerebral blood flow, and cytochrome c oxidase redox state to evaluate any metabolic effects of hypercapnia. Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and cytochrome oxidase redox state were measured with broadband near infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Data collected during 5-minutes hypercapnia in human volunteers were analyzed using a Fick model to determine changes in brain oxygen consumption and a mathematical model of cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism (BrainSignals) to inform on the potential mechanisms of any observed changes. Systemic physiology - blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturations and end-tidal carbon dioxide - served as model inputs. The extent of the hypercapnic oxidation of cytochrome oxidase required modifications of the BrainSignals model; simulations compared two possible modifications that could cause this oxidation - a decrease in metabolic substrate supply or an increase in metabolic demand. Only the decrease in substrate supply was able to explain both the enzyme redox state changes and the Fick calculated drop in brain oxygen consumption. These modelled outputs are consistent with, but do not prove, previous reports of CO2 inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These findings suggest that hypercapnia may have physiologically significant effects suppressing oxidative metabolism in humans and perturbing mitochondrial signaling pathways in health and disease.\nEarly-life stress triggers long-lasting organismal resilience and longevity via tetraspanin\nAuthors: Jiang, W. I.; Belly, H. D.; Wang, B. K.; Wong, A.; Kim, M.; Oh, F.; DeGeorge, J.; Huang, X.; Guang, S.; Weiner, O. K.; Ma, D. K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550452\nEarly-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) have been implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy with age and disuse. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an enzyme of Lands cycle, conjugates a polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain to a lysophospholipid (PUFA-PL) molecule, providing substrates for LOOH propagation. Previous studies suggest that inhibition of Lands cycle is an effective strategy to suppress LOOH. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific tamoxifen-inducible knockout of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKO) were utilized to determine if muscle-specific attenuation of LOOH may alleviate muscle atrophy and weakness with disuse. LPCAT3-MKO and control mice underwent 7 days of sham or hindlimb unloading (HU model) to study muscle mass and force-generating capacity. LOOH was assessed by quantifying 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-conjugated peptides. Quantitative PCR and lipid mass spectrometry were used to validate LPCAT3 deletion. 7 days of HU was sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and weakness concomitant to an increase in 4-HNE. Deletion of LPCAT3 reversed HU-induced increase in muscle 4HNE. No difference was found in body mass, body composition, or caloric intake between genotypes. The soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PLANT) muscles of the LPCAT3-MKO mice were partially protected from atrophy compared to controls, concomitant to attenuated decrease in cross-sectional areas in type I and IIa fibers. Strikingly, SOL and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were robustly protected from HU-induced reduction in force-generating capacity in the LPCAT3-MKO mice compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate that attenuation of muscle LOOH is sufficient to restore skeletal muscle function, in particular a protection from reduction in muscle specific force. Thus, muscle LOOH contributes to atrophy and weakness induced by HU in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractDiversity across algal family Symbiodiniaceae contributes to the environmental resilience of certain coral species. Chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements are frequently used to determine symbiont health and resilience, but more work is needed to refine these tools and establish how they relate to underlying cellular traits. We examined trait diversity in symbionts from the generas Cladocopium and Durusdinium, collected from 12 aquacultured coral species. Photophysiological metrics ({Phi}PSII, {sigma}PSII, {rho}, {tau}1, {tau}2, ABQ, NPQ, and qP) were assessed using a prototype multi-spectral fluorometer over a variable light protocol which yielded a total of 1360 individual metrics. Photophysiological metrics were then used to establish four unique phenotypic variants. Corals harboring C15 were predominantly found within a single phenotype which clustered separately from all other coral fragments. The majority of Durusdinium dominated colonies also formed a separate phenotype which it shared with a few C1 dominated corals. C15 and D1 symbionts appear to differ in which mechanisms they employ to dissipate excess light energy. Spectrally dependent variability is also observed across phenotypes that may relate to differences in photopigment utilization. Cell physiology (atomic C:N:P, cell size, chlorophyll-a, neutral lipid content) was also assessed within each sample and differ across phenotypes, linking photophysiological metrics with underlying primary cellular traits. Strong correlations between first- and second-order traits, such as Quantum Yield and cellular N:P content, or light dissipation pathways (qP and NPQ) and C:P underline differences across symbiont types and may also provide a means for using fluorescence-based metrics as biomarkers for certain primary-cellular traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Salps are pelagic tunicates that are able to form large blooms under favorable conditions by alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction. While their role in the regional carbon cycle is receiving attention, our knowledge of their physiology is still limited. This knowledge gap is mainly due to their fragile gelatinous nature, which makes it difficult to capture intact specimens and maintain them in the laboratory. We present here a modified kreisel tank system, that was tested onboard using the Southern Ocean salp Salpa thompsoni and station-based using the Mediterranean species Salpa fusiformis. Successful maintenance over days to weeks allowed us to obtain comparable relative growth and developmental rates as in situ, and provided insight into their potential life cycle strategies. By providing a starting point for successful maintenance, we hope to stimulate future experimental research on this understudied taxonomic group.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, general hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzyme inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia due to renal disease and osteoporosis. However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Timing of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earth&#39;s rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often don&#39;t concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified &gt;1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, &gt;40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and &gt; 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonas&#39;s unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInsomnia symptoms have been associated with CVD, doubling the risk of incident CVD, but specific shared pathways remain poorly understood. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic loci significantly associated with insomnia symptoms, including one locus that was previously associated with CVD in an independent GWAS.

MethodsTo evaluate the cell-autonomous role of genes near the CVD- and insomnia-related locus, we used Drosophila melanogaster models to perform tissue-specific RNAi knockdown of these genes in the heart and neurons. We also performed suppression of these genes in the heart or neurons, and assessed sleep or cardiac function, respectively, to identify non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.

ResultsOur results show that neuronal and cardiac-specific RNAi knockdown of four genes conserved in Drosophila, Lsn, ATPSynC, Bruce, and Imp, contributes to compromised sleep and cardiac performance, respectively. Cardiac-specific knockdown of Lsn led to significant cardiac dilation and reduced cardiac performance. Knockdown of ATPSynC led to significantly reduced cardiac performance without dilations. Furthermore, Lsn and ATPSynC-suppressed hearts showed disruption in the actin-containing myofibrillar organization and led to a significantly shortened lifespan. Suppression of Lsn increased pericardin deposition, indicative of a fibrotic phenotype. Neuronal-specific knockdown of ATPSynC, Imp, and Lsn led to compromised sleep. Moreover, the knockdown of Imp in the brain led to a significantly compromised cardiac function characterized by decreased systolic and diastolic intervals and fractional shortening in a non-cell autonomous manner. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bruce, ATPSynC, and Lsn in the heart led to compromised sleep characterized by decreased activity and daytime activity and increased bin number in a non-cell autonomous manner.

ConclusionsOur study provides novel insights into genetic mechanisms linking CVD and insomnia, highlighting the importance of these four conserved genes in the development and association of both diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Small arteries exhibit resting tone, a partially contracted state that maintains arterial blood pressure. In arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), potassium channels control contraction and relaxation. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been shown to exert anticontractile effects on the blood vessels. However, the mechanisms by which PVAT signals small arteries, and their relevance, remain largely unknown. We aimed to uncover key molecular components in adipose-vascular coupling. Methods: A wide-spectrum of genetic mouse models targeting Kcnq3, Kcnq4 and Kcnq5 genes (Kcnq3-/-, Kcnq4-/-, Kcnq5-/-, Kcnq5dn/dn, Kcnq4-/-/Kcnq5dn/dn, Kcnq4-/-/Kcnq5-/-), telemetry blood pressure measurements, targeted lipidomics, and RNA-Seq profiling, wire-myography, patch-clamp, and sharp-electrode membrane potential measurements were used. Results: We show that PVAT causes SMC KCNQ5 (KV7.5) channels to hyperpolarize the membrane potential. This effect relaxes small arteries and regulates blood pressure. Oxygenation of polyunsaturated fats generates oxylipins, a superclass of lipid mediators. We identified numerous oxylipins released by PVAT that potentiate vasodilatory action in small arteries by opening SMC KCNQ5 channels. Conclusions: Our results reveal a key molecular function of KCNQ5 channels in adipose-vascular coupling, translating PVAT signals, particularly oxylipins, to the central physiological function of vasoregulation. This novel pathway opens new therapeutic perspectives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hypercapnia increases cerebral blood flow, but the effect on cerebral metabolism in humans remains incompletely understood. Either increased or reduced oxygen consumption has been predicted from Fick models incorporating cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood flow. Hypercapnia also results in oxidation of cytochrome c oxidase, complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, implicating a change in cellular metabolism. The aim of this study was to combine systems modelling with non-invasive measurements of cerebral tissue oxygenation, cerebral blood flow, and cytochrome c oxidase redox state to evaluate any metabolic effects of hypercapnia. Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and cytochrome oxidase redox state were measured with broadband near infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Data collected during 5-minutes hypercapnia in human volunteers were analyzed using a Fick model to determine changes in brain oxygen consumption and a mathematical model of cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism (BrainSignals) to inform on the potential mechanisms of any observed changes. Systemic physiology - blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturations and end-tidal carbon dioxide - served as model inputs. The extent of the hypercapnic oxidation of cytochrome oxidase required modifications of the BrainSignals model; simulations compared two possible modifications that could cause this oxidation - a decrease in metabolic substrate supply or an increase in metabolic demand. Only the decrease in substrate supply was able to explain both the enzyme redox state changes and the Fick calculated drop in brain oxygen consumption. These modelled outputs are consistent with, but do not prove, previous reports of CO2 inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These findings suggest that hypercapnia may have physiologically significant effects suppressing oxidative metabolism in humans and perturbing mitochondrial signaling pathways in health and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.</p>
