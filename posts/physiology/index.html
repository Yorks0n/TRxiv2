Mitochondria in HF show changes in structure, while myofibrils exhibit increased cross-sectional area and branching. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses indicate concomitant dysregulation in key pathways. The findings underscore the need for personalized treatments considering individualized structural changes in HF.\nIdentification of conserved gene expression programs activated in multiple modes of torpor across vertebrate clades.\nAuthors: Weir, K.; Vega, N.; Busa, V.; Sajdak, B.; Kallestad, L.; Merriman, D.; Palczewski, K.; Carroll, J.; Blackshaw, S.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569284\nTorpor encompasses adaptations to diverse extreme environmental stressors such as hibernation, aestivation, brumation, and daily torpor. Here we introduce StrokeofGenus, an analytic pipeline that identifies distinct transcriptomic states and conservation of gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species. We use StrokeofGenus to study multiple and diverse forms of torpor from publicly available RNA-seq datasets that span eight species and two classes. We identify three transcriptionally distinct states during the cycle of heterothermia: euthermia, torpor, and interbout arousal. We also identify torpor-specific gene expression patterns that are conserved both across tissues and between species with over three hundred million years of evolutionary divergence. We further demonstrate the general conservation of gene expression patterns in multiple forms of torpor, implying a common evolutionary origin for this process. Although here we apply StrokeofGenus to analysis of torpor, it can be used to interrogate any other complex physiological processes defined by transient transcriptomic states. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIStrokeofGenus integrates orthologue annotation, non-negative matrix factorization, and transfer learning for cross-species analysis. C_LIO_LIStrokeofGenus identifies conserved topor-related gene expression patterns across divergent species and cell types. C_LIO_LIHeterothermia has three distinct transcriptomic states. C_LIO_LITorpor-specific gene expression patterns are conserved between species and forms of torpor.

V.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569524\nEvaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.\nHuman skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity beyond myosin heavy chains\nAuthors: Moreno-Justicia, R.; Van der Stede, T.; Stocks, B.; Laitila, J.; Seaborne, R. A.; Van de Loock, A.; Lievens, E.; Samodova, D.; Marin-Arraiza, L.; Dmytriyeva, O.; Van Vossel, K.; Yigit, N.; Anckaert, J.; Weyns, A.; Van Thienen, R.; Sahl, R. E.; Zanoteli, E.; Wierer, M.; Mestdagh, P.; Lawlor, M. W.; Vandesompele, J.; Ochala, J.; Hostrup, M.; Derave, W.; Deshmukh, A. S.\nScore: 64.9, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

M.; Wu, J.; Zhang, B.; Zheng, Z.-Z.; Piao, H.-l.; Shui, G.; Deng, X.; Zhang, C.-S.; Lin, S.-C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570559\nCalorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention to promote health and longevity. CR causes various metabolic changes in both the production and circulation of metabolites; however, it remains unclear which of the changed metabolite(s) can account for the physiological benefits of CR. Through metabolomic analysis of metabolites undergoing abundance changes during CR and subsequent functional validation, we found that lithocholic acid (LCA) is the only metabolite that alone can recapitulate the effects of CR, including activation of AMPK and the rejuvenating effects of muscle regeneration, grip strength and running capacity in mice. Interestingly, LCA also activates AMPK and exerts life- and health-extending effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, indicating that these animal models are able to transmit the signalling of LCA once administered. Knockout of AMPK abrogates LCA-induced phenotypes, in nematodes and flies, as well as in mice. Together, we have identified that administration of the CR-upregulated metabolite LCA alone can confer anti-ageing benefits to metazoans, in an AMPK-dependent manner.\nThe Cardiac Calcium Handling Machinery is Remodeled in Friedreich's Ataxia\nAuthors: Czornobil, R.; Assali, O. A.-; Wood, E. R.-; Lynch, D. R.; Noujaim, S. F.; Chidipi, B.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566141\nBackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis. ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2+ handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA. MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT. ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nLithocholic acid targets TULP3 to activate sirtuins and AMPK to retard ageing\nAuthors: Qu, Q.; Chen, Y.; Wang, Y.; Long, S.; Wang, W.; Yang, H.-Y.; Wu, J.; Li, M.; Tian, X.; Wei, X.; Liu, Y.-H.; Xu, S.; Yang, C.; Wu, Z.; Huang, X.; Xie, C.; Wu, Y.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, C.; Zhang, B.; Feng, J.-W.; Chen, J.; Sun, B.; Piao, H.-l.; Xie, X.-S.; Deng, X.; Zhang, C.-S.; Lin, S.-C.; Lin, L.; Xie, Z.; Yu, Y.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570558\nLithocholic acid (LCA), accumulated in the body during calorie restriction (CR), can confer administered metazoans with the ability to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and retard ageing. However, how LCA is signalled to activate AMPK and elicit the biological effects is unclear. Here, we show that LCA can enhance sirtuins (SIRTs) to deacetylate and subsequently inhibit vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), thereby triggering AMPK activation via the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway. Through proteomic analysis of SIRT1-coimmunoprecipitated proteins, we identify and validate that TUB like protein 3 (TULP3) is a constitutive component of SIRTs. Surprisingly, we found that TULP3 is an LCA receptor, and that the LCA-bound TULP3 activates SIRTs. The activated SIRTs in turn deacetylate the V1E1 subunit of v-ATPase on K52, K99 and K191 residues. Muscle-specific expression of the 3KR mutant of V1E1, mimicking the deacetylated state, dominantly activates AMPK and rejuvenates muscles in aged mice. Moreover, LCA once administered also activates AMPK and extends lifespan and healthspan in nematodes and flies, depending on the TULP3 homologues tub-1 and ktub, respectively. Our study thus elucidates that LCA triggers the TULP3-sirtuin-v-ATPase- AMPK route to manifest benefits of calorie restriction.\nVariations in cellular unfolded protein response, respiratory capacity, and stress tolerance in skin and lung fibroblasts of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus)\nAuthors: Yap, K. N.; Yamada, K.; Zikeli, S. L.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Naderi, A.; Soltanmohammadi, E.; Kavazis, A. N.; Roberts, M. D.; Kiaris, H.; Hood, W. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570632\nEvolutionary physiologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms underpinning variation in life-history performance. Recent efforts to elucidate these mechanisms focused on bioenergetics and oxidative stress. One underappreciated area that could play a role in mediating variation in performance is the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response that reduces secretory protein load, enhances endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding and clearance capacity during stress and during its adaptive phase. Given that the ER and mitochondria interact to regulate cellular homeostasis, it seems intuitive that UPR phenotype would correlate strongly with mitochondrial physiology, which in turn would contribute to variations in whole-organism metabolism. One way researchers have been studying cellular controls of life-history traits is by assessing stress resistance and bioenergetic properties of primary dermal fibroblasts. However, it is unclear if findings from dermal fibroblasts can be generalized to other cell and tissue types, and if fibroblasts' phenotypes are repeatable across different life-history stages. This study aimed to explore the relationships between UPR profile, cellular respiration, and stress resistance using primary dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty and primary lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood. Specifically, we tested if 1) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty corresponds to UPR profile of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood, 2) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty and lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood correspond to cellular bioenergetics of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood, and 3) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty corresponds to multiplex stress resistance (ER stress, oxidative stress, DNA damage) of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood. We found that only tunicamycin induced BiP expression was repeatable in skin and lung fibroblasts. Tunicamycin induced expressions of BiP, GRP94, and CNX in skin fibroblasts predicted resistance of lung fibroblasts to tunicamycin, (but not thapsigargin and other inducers of lethal stress), which is indicative for the pro-survival role of UPR during stress. Tunicamycin induced BiP expression in skin and lung fibroblasts also predicted multiple cellular bioenergetics parameters in lung fibroblasts.\nComplex biophysical changes and reduced neuronal firing in an SCN8A variant associated with developmental delay and epilepsy\nAuthors: Quinn, S.; Zhang, N.; Fenton, T. A.; Brusel, M.; Muruganandam, P.; Peleg, Y.; Giladi, M.; Haitin, Y.; Lerche, H.; Bassan, H.; Liu, Y.; Ben-Shalom, R.; Rubinstein, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569940\nMutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.6, result in a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes. The p.(Gly1625Arg) (G1625R) mutation was identified in a patient diagnosed with Developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), presenting with moderate epilepsy and severe developmental delay. This variant is positioned within the S4 segment of domain IV, a critical region for NaV1.6 function where pathogenic variants were shown to cause either a loss or gain of channel function, but often with mixed biophysical alterations. Voltage-clamp analyses of NaV1.6G1625R demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of gain- and loss-of-function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and increased channel availability with high-frequency repeated depolarization. Further studies using current clamp analyses in transfected cultured neurons showed that these intricate biophysical properties had a minor effect on neuronal excitability when firing relayed on both the endogenous and transfected NaV channels. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in the number of action potentials when the firing was driven solely by the transfected TTX-resistant mutant NaV1.6 compared to WT NaV1.6 channels. Moreover, using a computational model of mature cortical neurons, we revealed a mild reduction of neuronal firing when mimicking the patients heterozygous SCN8A expression. Structural modeling of NaV1.6G1625R, using the cryo-EM structure of NaV1.6, suggested the possible formation of cation-{pi} interaction between R1625 and F1588 within domain IV. Double-mutant cycle analysis demonstrated that this functional interaction affects the voltage dependence of inactivation in NaV1.6G1625R. Together, our analyses demonstrate a complex combination of gain and loss of function biophysical changes that result in an overall mild reduction in neuronal firing, related to the perturbed interaction network within the voltage sensor domain. Significance statementMutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.6, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we provided clinical, neurophysiological, and mechanistic analyses of the p.(Gly1625Arg) mutation, identified in a patient with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Electrophysiological recording demonstrated complex gain and loss of function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation related to perturbed interaction within domain IV. These intricate biophysical changes cumulated to reduced firing in cultured hippocampal neurons and computational modeling of mature cortical neurons, demonstrating an overall loss of function effect.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Torpor encompasses adaptations to diverse extreme environmental stressors such as hibernation, aestivation, brumation, and daily torpor. Here we introduce StrokeofGenus, an analytic pipeline that identifies distinct transcriptomic states and conservation of gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species. We use StrokeofGenus to study multiple and diverse forms of torpor from publicly available RNA-seq datasets that span eight species and two classes. We identify three transcriptionally distinct states during the cycle of heterothermia: euthermia, torpor, and interbout arousal. We also identify torpor-specific gene expression patterns that are conserved both across tissues and between species with over three hundred million years of evolutionary divergence. We further demonstrate the general conservation of gene expression patterns in multiple forms of torpor, implying a common evolutionary origin for this process. Although here we apply StrokeofGenus to analysis of torpor, it can be used to interrogate any other complex physiological processes defined by transient transcriptomic states.

        <p class="abstract">Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

        <p class="abstract">Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention to promote health and longevity. CR causes various metabolic changes in both the production and circulation of metabolites; however, it remains unclear which of the changed metabolite(s) can account for the physiological benefits of CR. Through metabolomic analysis of metabolites undergoing abundance changes during CR and subsequent functional validation, we found that lithocholic acid (LCA) is the only metabolite that alone can recapitulate the effects of CR, including activation of AMPK and the rejuvenating effects of muscle regeneration, grip strength and running capacity in mice. Interestingly, LCA also activates AMPK and exerts life- and health-extending effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, indicating that these animal models are able to transmit the signalling of LCA once administered. Knockout of AMPK abrogates LCA-induced phenotypes, in nematodes and flies, as well as in mice. Together, we have identified that administration of the CR-upregulated metabolite LCA alone can confer anti-ageing benefits to metazoans, in an AMPK-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis.

ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2&#43; handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA.

MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT.

ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lithocholic acid (LCA), accumulated in the body during calorie restriction (CR), can confer administered metazoans with the ability to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and retard ageing. However, how LCA is signalled to activate AMPK and elicit the biological effects is unclear. Here, we show that LCA can enhance sirtuins (SIRTs) to deacetylate and subsequently inhibit vacuolar H&#43;-ATPase (v-ATPase), thereby triggering AMPK activation via the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway. Through proteomic analysis of SIRT1-coimmunoprecipitated proteins, we identify and validate that TUB like protein 3 (TULP3) is a constitutive component of SIRTs. Surprisingly, we found that TULP3 is an LCA receptor, and that the LCA-bound TULP3 activates SIRTs. The activated SIRTs in turn deacetylate the V1E1 subunit of v-ATPase on K52, K99 and K191 residues. Muscle-specific expression of the 3KR mutant of V1E1, mimicking the deacetylated state, dominantly activates AMPK and rejuvenates muscles in aged mice. Moreover, LCA once administered also activates AMPK and extends lifespan and healthspan in nematodes and flies, depending on the TULP3 homologues tub-1 and ktub, respectively. Our study thus elucidates that LCA triggers the TULP3-sirtuin-v-ATPase- AMPK route to manifest benefits of calorie restriction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evolutionary physiologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms underpinning variation in life-history performance. Recent efforts to elucidate these mechanisms focused on bioenergetics and oxidative stress. One underappreciated area that could play a role in mediating variation in performance is the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response that reduces secretory protein load, enhances endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding and clearance capacity during stress and during its adaptive phase. Given that the ER and mitochondria interact to regulate cellular homeostasis, it seems intuitive that UPR phenotype would correlate strongly with mitochondrial physiology, which in turn would contribute to variations in whole-organism metabolism. One way researchers have been studying cellular controls of life-history traits is by assessing stress resistance and bioenergetic properties of primary dermal fibroblasts. However, it is unclear if findings from dermal fibroblasts can be generalized to other cell and tissue types, and if fibroblasts&#39; phenotypes are repeatable across different life-history stages. This study aimed to explore the relationships between UPR profile, cellular respiration, and stress resistance using primary dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty and primary lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood. Specifically, we tested if 1) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty corresponds to UPR profile of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood, 2) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty and lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood correspond to cellular bioenergetics of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood, and 3) UPR profile of dermal fibroblasts isolated at puberty corresponds to multiplex stress resistance (ER stress, oxidative stress, DNA damage) of lung fibroblasts isolated at adulthood. We found that only tunicamycin induced BiP expression was repeatable in skin and lung fibroblasts. Tunicamycin induced expressions of BiP, GRP94, and CNX in skin fibroblasts predicted resistance of lung fibroblasts to tunicamycin, (but not thapsigargin and other inducers of lethal stress), which is indicative for the pro-survival role of UPR during stress. Tunicamycin induced BiP expression in skin and lung fibroblasts also predicted multiple cellular bioenergetics parameters in lung fibroblasts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.6, result in a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes. The p.(Gly1625Arg) (G1625R) mutation was identified in a patient diagnosed with Developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), presenting with moderate epilepsy and severe developmental delay. This variant is positioned within the S4 segment of domain IV, a critical region for NaV1.6 function where pathogenic variants were shown to cause either a loss or gain of channel function, but often with mixed biophysical alterations. Voltage-clamp analyses of NaV1.6G1625R demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of gain- and loss-of-function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and increased channel availability with high-frequency repeated depolarization. Further studies using current clamp analyses in transfected cultured neurons showed that these intricate biophysical properties had a minor effect on neuronal excitability when firing relayed on both the endogenous and transfected NaV channels. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in the number of action potentials when the firing was driven solely by the transfected TTX-resistant mutant NaV1.6 compared to WT NaV1.6 channels. Moreover, using a computational model of mature cortical neurons, we revealed a mild reduction of neuronal firing when mimicking the patients heterozygous SCN8A expression. Structural modeling of NaV1.6G1625R, using the cryo-EM structure of NaV1.6, suggested the possible formation of cation-{pi} interaction between R1625 and F1588 within domain IV. Double-mutant cycle analysis demonstrated that this functional interaction affects the voltage dependence of inactivation in NaV1.6G1625R. Together, our analyses demonstrate a complex combination of gain and loss of function biophysical changes that result in an overall mild reduction in neuronal firing, related to the perturbed interaction network within the voltage sensor domain.

Significance statementMutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.6, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we provided clinical, neurophysiological, and mechanistic analyses of the p.(Gly1625Arg) mutation, identified in a patient with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Electrophysiological recording demonstrated complex gain and loss of function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation related to perturbed interaction within domain IV. These intricate biophysical changes cumulated to reduced firing in cultured hippocampal neurons and computational modeling of mature cortical neurons, demonstrating an overall loss of function effect.</p>
