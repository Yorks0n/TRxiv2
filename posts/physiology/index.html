S.\nScore: 63.0, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

E.; Kashyap, P. C.; Linden, D. R.; Theriault, B.; Chang, E. B.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566304\nGastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.\nFibre-specific mitochondrial protein abundance is linked to resting and post-training mitochondrial content in human muscle.\nAuthors: Reisman, E.; Botella Ruiz, J.; Huang, C.; Schittenhelm, R.

J.\nScore: 40.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.23.512956\nAnalyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.\nAdherent reformed islets: a long-term primary cell-based platform for exploring mouse and human islet biology.\nAuthors: Haq, N.; Toczyska, K.; Wilson, M.; Jacobs, M.; Lei, Y.; Zhao, M.; Pearson, J.; Persaud, S.; Pullen, T.; Bewick, G. A.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568245\nPancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity. Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells. Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.

J.; Hahn, D.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568422\nWhether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9 - 23.2 mm, p [\u0026le;] 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre-activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise. New \u0026 NoteworthyApparent eccentric exercises do not result in isolated eccentric contractions, but shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level. The amount of fascicle shortening and stretch depend on the pre-activation during the exercise and cannot be estimated from the muscle-tendon unit or joint kinematics. As different fascicle mechanics might trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, muscle-tendon unit series elasticity and muscle pre-activation need to be considered when eccentric exercise protocols and designed and evaluated.\nAge-related structural and functional changes of the intracardiac nervous system\nAuthors: Hortells, L.; Zgierski-Johnston, C. M.; Kohl, P.; Schneider-Warme, F.; Ravens, U.; Preissl, S.; Cameron, B. A.; Koch, M.; Brennan, T. A.; Madl, J.; Iaconianni, P.; Fernandez, M.

Here we investigate the differences in cardiac SC, parasympathetic nerve fibers, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) expression in young and old mice. Additionally, we examine age-related changes in cardiac responses to sympathomimetic and parasympathomimetic drugs. Methods and ResultsLower SC density, lower SC proliferation and fewer parasympathetic nerve fibers were observed in cardiac and, as a control sciatic nerves from old (20-24 months) compared to young mice (2-3 months). In old mice, CSPG4 was increased in sciatic but not cardiac nerves. Expression of M2R was lower in ventricular myocardium and ventricular conduction system from old mice compared to young mice, while no significant difference was seen in M2R expression in sino-atrial or atrio-ventricular node pacemaker tissue. Heart rate was slower and PQ intervals were longer in Langendorff-perfused hearts from old mice. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were more frequently observed in response to carbachol administration in hearts from old mice versus those from young mice. ConclusionsOn the background of reduced presence of SC and parasympathetic nerve fibers, and of lower M2R expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes and conduction system of aged hearts, the propensity of ventricular arrhythmogenesis upon parasympathomimetic drug application is increased. Whether this is caused by an increase in heterogeneity of iCNS structure and function remains to be elucidated.

J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568776\nSkeletal muscle regeneration depends on the function of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Here we show that aging impairs myogenic stem cells and immunomodulatory processes by disrupting extracellular matrix function, thereby inhibiting regeneration in aged muscle. We identify the FAP-secreted matricellular protein Periostin as a niche factor that is decreased in aged murine muscle and in circulation of aged humans with low-exercise lifestyle. Periostin controls FAP-expansion after injury and its loss fate-regulates FAPs to contribute to fibro/fatty infiltration. This causes stem cell defects and attenuates pro- to anti-inflammatory macrophage transition during regeneration. Transplantation of young FAPs with high Periostin secretion, but not Periostin-deficient FAPs, into aged muscle restores anti-inflammatory niche formation and regeneration. Mechanistically, Periostin activates Focal adhesion kinase- and AKT-signaling in macrophages via integrin binding to promote an anti-inflammatory profile, which synchronizes matrix-derived mechanosensory signaling and immunomodulation. These results uncover a key role of FAP-based matrix regulation via niche factors that orchestrate successful muscle regeneration.\nDefining the in vivo role of mTORC1 in thyrocytes by studying the TSC2 conditional knockout mouse model\nAuthors: Rossetti, C. L.; Lourenconi, B.; Pecanha, F. L. M.; Franco, A. T.; Nose, V.; Lew, J.; Carneiro, E.; Bernal-Mizrachi, E.; Werneck de Castro, J. P.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565171\nThe thyroid gland is susceptible to abnormal epithelial cell growth, often resulting in thyroid dysfunction. The serine-threonine protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth through two different protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathways overactivity is well associated with heightened aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, but recent studies indicate the involvement of mTORC2 as well. To elucidate mTORC1s role in thyrocytes, we developed a novel mouse model with mTORC1 gain of function in thyrocytes by deleting Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an intracellular inhibitor of mTORC1. The resulting TPO-TSC2KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in TSC2 levels, leading to a six-fold increase in mTORC1 activity. Thyroid glands of both male and female TPO-TSC2KO mice displayed rapid enlargement and continued growth throughout life, accompanied by heterogeneity among thyroid follicles, larger follicles, increased colloid and epithelium. We observed elevated thyrocyte proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining and elevated Cyclin D3 expression in the TPO-TSC2KO mice. mTORC1 activation resulted in a progressive downregulation of key genes involved in thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis, including thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), while TTF1, PAX8, and MCT8 mRNA levels remained unaffected. NIS protein expression was also diminished in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented thyroid mass expansion and restored the gene expression alterations in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Although T4, T3 and TSH plasma levels were normal at 2 months of age, a slight decrease in T4 and an increase in TSH levels were observed at 6 and 12 months of age while T3 remained similar in TPO-TSC2KO compared to littermate control mice. TPO-TSC2KO mice aged to 12 months or older developed aberrant thyroid conditions, including follicular hyperplasia, inflammation, and thyroid tumors. In conclusion, our thyrocyte-specific mouse model reveals that mTORC1 activation inhibits TH biosynthesis, suppresses thyrocyte gene expression, and promotes growth and proliferation. Chronic mTORC1 activation leads to thyroid tumor formation, highlighting the role of mTORC1 in thyroid dysfunction and tumorigenesis.\nInsulin at the Intersection of Thermoregulation and Glucose Homeostasis\nAuthors: Winn, N. C.; Schleh, M. W.; Garcia, J. N.; Lantier, L.; McGuinness, O. P.; Blair, J. A.; Hasty, A. H.; Wasserman, D. H.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.566254\nMammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (\u003c12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action, insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis. HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice. C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis. C_LIO_LIBrown fat glucose uptake sensitively increases with RT and decreases with TN by an insulin-independent mechanism.

F.; Chidipi, B.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566141\nBackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis. ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2+ handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA. MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT. ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

        <p class="abstract">Gastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Analyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity.

Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells.

Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.

        <p class="abstract">Whether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9 - 23.2 mm, p [&amp;le;] 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre-activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise.

New &amp; NoteworthyApparent eccentric exercises do not result in isolated eccentric contractions, but shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level. The amount of fascicle shortening and stretch depend on the pre-activation during the exercise and cannot be estimated from the muscle-tendon unit or joint kinematics. As different fascicle mechanics might trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, muscle-tendon unit series elasticity and muscle pre-activation need to be considered when eccentric exercise protocols and designed and evaluated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlthough aging is known to be associated with an increased incidence of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, there is limited knowledge about how Schwann cells (SC) and the intracardiac nervous system (iCNS) remodel with age. Here we investigate the differences in cardiac SC, parasympathetic nerve fibers, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) expression in young and old mice. Additionally, we examine age-related changes in cardiac responses to sympathomimetic and parasympathomimetic drugs.

Methods and ResultsLower SC density, lower SC proliferation and fewer parasympathetic nerve fibers were observed in cardiac and, as a control sciatic nerves from old (20-24 months) compared to young mice (2-3 months). In old mice, CSPG4 was increased in sciatic but not cardiac nerves. Expression of M2R was lower in ventricular myocardium and ventricular conduction system from old mice compared to young mice, while no significant difference was seen in M2R expression in sino-atrial or atrio-ventricular node pacemaker tissue. Heart rate was slower and PQ intervals were longer in Langendorff-perfused hearts from old mice. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were more frequently observed in response to carbachol administration in hearts from old mice versus those from young mice.

ConclusionsOn the background of reduced presence of SC and parasympathetic nerve fibers, and of lower M2R expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes and conduction system of aged hearts, the propensity of ventricular arrhythmogenesis upon parasympathomimetic drug application is increased. Whether this is caused by an increase in heterogeneity of iCNS structure and function remains to be elucidated.

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle regeneration depends on the function of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Here we show that aging impairs myogenic stem cells and immunomodulatory processes by disrupting extracellular matrix function, thereby inhibiting regeneration in aged muscle. We identify the FAP-secreted matricellular protein Periostin as a niche factor that is decreased in aged murine muscle and in circulation of aged humans with low-exercise lifestyle. Periostin controls FAP-expansion after injury and its loss fate-regulates FAPs to contribute to fibro/fatty infiltration. This causes stem cell defects and attenuates pro- to anti-inflammatory macrophage transition during regeneration. Transplantation of young FAPs with high Periostin secretion, but not Periostin-deficient FAPs, into aged muscle restores anti-inflammatory niche formation and regeneration. Mechanistically, Periostin activates Focal adhesion kinase- and AKT-signaling in macrophages via integrin binding to promote an anti-inflammatory profile, which synchronizes matrix-derived mechanosensory signaling and immunomodulation. These results uncover a key role of FAP-based matrix regulation via niche factors that orchestrate successful muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The thyroid gland is susceptible to abnormal epithelial cell growth, often resulting in thyroid dysfunction. The serine-threonine protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth through two different protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathways overactivity is well associated with heightened aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, but recent studies indicate the involvement of mTORC2 as well. To elucidate mTORC1s role in thyrocytes, we developed a novel mouse model with mTORC1 gain of function in thyrocytes by deleting Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an intracellular inhibitor of mTORC1. The resulting TPO-TSC2KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in TSC2 levels, leading to a six-fold increase in mTORC1 activity. Thyroid glands of both male and female TPO-TSC2KO mice displayed rapid enlargement and continued growth throughout life, accompanied by heterogeneity among thyroid follicles, larger follicles, increased colloid and epithelium. We observed elevated thyrocyte proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining and elevated Cyclin D3 expression in the TPO-TSC2KO mice. mTORC1 activation resulted in a progressive downregulation of key genes involved in thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis, including thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), while TTF1, PAX8, and MCT8 mRNA levels remained unaffected. NIS protein expression was also diminished in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented thyroid mass expansion and restored the gene expression alterations in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Although T4, T3 and TSH plasma levels were normal at 2 months of age, a slight decrease in T4 and an increase in TSH levels were observed at 6 and 12 months of age while T3 remained similar in TPO-TSC2KO compared to littermate control mice. TPO-TSC2KO mice aged to 12 months or older developed aberrant thyroid conditions, including follicular hyperplasia, inflammation, and thyroid tumors. In conclusion, our thyrocyte-specific mouse model reveals that mTORC1 activation inhibits TH biosynthesis, suppresses thyrocyte gene expression, and promotes growth and proliferation. Chronic mTORC1 activation leads to thyroid tumor formation, highlighting the role of mTORC1 in thyroid dysfunction and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (&lt;12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action,  insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis.

HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room  laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice.
C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis.
C_LIO_LIBrown fat glucose uptake sensitively increases with RT and decreases with TN by an insulin-independent mechanism.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis.

ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2&#43; handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA.

MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT.

ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
