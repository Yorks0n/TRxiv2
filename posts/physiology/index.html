In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1+/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.\nIntestinal barrier function in the naked mole-rat: an emergent model for gastrointestinal insights\nAuthors: Aguilera-Lizarraga, J.; Ritoux, A.; Bulmer, D.; Smith, E. S. J.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576063\nThe intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in homeostasis, both by facilitating absorption of nutrients and providing a tight shield to prevent the invasion by either pathogen or commensal microorganisms. Intestinal barrier malfunction is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to the dysregulation of other tissues such as the liver, fat, skeletal muscle, and brain. Hence, a deeper understanding of physiological aspects related to an enhanced barrier function is of great clinical relevance. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has many unusual biological features, including impaired colonic neuron sensitivity to acid and bradykinin, and resistance to chemically induced intestinal damage. However, insight into their intestinal barrier physiology is scarce. Here, we observed notable differences in intestinal tissue structure between naked mole-rats and mice, especially in the ileum. This was characterised by thicker muscularis and submucosa layers, longer villi and larger crypts. In measuring gut permeability, naked mole-rats showed reduced permeability compared to mice, especially in the small intestine (ileum). Furthermore, intestinal anion secretion induced by serotonin, bradykinin, histamine and capsaicin was significantly impaired in naked mole-rats compared to mice, despite the expression of receptors for all these agonists. Collectively, these findings indicate that naked mole-rats possess a robust gastrointestinal barrier, that is hard to penetrate and is resistant to environmental and endogenous irritants. Naked mole-rats may therefore provide valuable insights into the physiology of the intestinal barrier related to different pathological conditions and set the stage for the development of innovative and effective therapies.\nATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 constrains metabolic responses to high-fat diet in male mice\nAuthors: Villalobos, E.; Miguelez-Crespo, A.; Morgan, R. A.; Ivatt, L.; Kurian, D.; Aguilar, J.; Kline, R. A.; Wishart, T. M.; Morton, N.; Stimson, R. H.; Andrew, R.; Walker, B. R.; Nixon, M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576896\nGlucocorticoids modulate glucose homeostasis, acting on metabolically active tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Intra-cellular regulation of glucocorticoid action in adipose tissue impacts metabolic responses to obesity. ATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 (ABCC1) is a transmembrane glucocorticoid transporter known to limit the accumulation of exogenously administered corticosterone in adipose tissue. However, the role of ABCC1 in the regulation of endogenous glucocorticoid action and its impact on fuel metabolism has not been studied. Here, we investigate the impact of Abcc1 deficiency on glucocorticoid action and high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In lean mice, deficiency of Abcc1 increased endogenous corticosterone levels in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but did not impact insulin sensitivity. In contrast, Abcc1-deficient mice on HFD displayed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia, without alterations in tissue corticosterone levels. Proteomics and bulk RNA sequencing in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle revealed that Abcc1 deficiency amplified the transcriptional response to an obesogenic diet in adipose tissue. Moreover, the Abcc1 deficiency impairs key signalling pathways related to glucose metabolism in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, in particular those related to OXPHOS machinery and Glut4. Together, our results highlight a role for ABCC1 in regulating glucose homeostasis, demonstrating diet-dependent effects that are not associated with altered tissue glucocorticoid concentrations.\nInitial pig developmental stage influences intestinal organoid growth but not phenotype\nAuthors: Duchesne, C.; Randuineau, G.; LE NORMAND, L.; Rome, V.; Laraqui, S.; Arnaud, A. P.; Boudry, G.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577507\nIntestinal organoids are promising tools in the context of animal experiment reduction. Yet, a thorough characterization of the impact of the origin of intestinal stem cells (ISC) on organoid phenotype is needed to routinely use this cellular model. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of ISC donor age on the growth, morphology and cellular composition of intestinal organoids derived from pig, a valuable model of Humans. Organoids were derived from jejunal and colonic ISC obtained from 1, 7, 28, 36 and 180-day old pigs and passaged three times. We first confirmed by qPCR that the expression of 18% of the \u003e80 studied genes related to various intestinal functions differed between jejunal and colonic organoids after two passages (P\u003c0.05). Growth and morphology of organoids depended on intestinal location (greater number and larger organoids derived from colonic than jejunal ISC, P\u003c0.05) but also pig age. Indeed, when ISC were derived from young piglets, the ratio of organoids to spheroids was greater (P\u003c0.05), spheroids were larger during the primary culture but smaller after two passages (P\u003c0.05) and organoids smaller after one passage (P\u003e0.05) compared to ISC from older pigs. Finally, no difference in cellular composition, evaluated by immunostaining of markers of the major intestinal cell types (absorptive, enteroendocrine and goblet cells) were observed between organoids originating from 7 or 180-day old pigs, while difference between intestinal site origin were noticed. In conclusion, while the age of the tissue donor affected organoid growth and morphology, it did not influence their phenotype.\n",

Furthermore, intestinal anion secretion induced by serotonin, bradykinin, histamine and capsaicin was significantly impaired in naked mole-rats compared to mice, despite the expression of receptors for all these agonists. Collectively, these findings indicate that naked mole-rats possess a robust gastrointestinal barrier, that is hard to penetrate and is resistant to environmental and endogenous irritants. Naked mole-rats may therefore provide valuable insights into the physiology of the intestinal barrier related to different pathological conditions and set the stage for the development of innovative and effective therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucocorticoids modulate glucose homeostasis, acting on metabolically active tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Intra-cellular regulation of glucocorticoid action in adipose tissue impacts metabolic responses to obesity. ATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 (ABCC1) is a transmembrane glucocorticoid transporter known to limit the accumulation of exogenously administered corticosterone in adipose tissue. However, the role of ABCC1 in the regulation of endogenous glucocorticoid action and its impact on fuel metabolism has not been studied. Here, we investigate the impact of Abcc1 deficiency on glucocorticoid action and high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In lean mice, deficiency of Abcc1 increased endogenous corticosterone levels in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but did not impact insulin sensitivity. In contrast, Abcc1-deficient mice on HFD displayed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia, without alterations in tissue corticosterone levels. Proteomics and bulk RNA sequencing in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle revealed that Abcc1 deficiency amplified the transcriptional response to an obesogenic diet in adipose tissue. Moreover, the Abcc1 deficiency impairs key signalling pathways related to glucose metabolism in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, in particular those related to OXPHOS machinery and Glut4. Together, our results highlight a role for ABCC1 in regulating glucose homeostasis, demonstrating diet-dependent effects that are not associated with altered tissue glucocorticoid concentrations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal organoids are promising tools in the context of animal experiment reduction. Yet, a thorough characterization of the impact of the origin of intestinal stem cells (ISC) on organoid phenotype is needed to routinely use this cellular model. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of ISC donor age on the growth, morphology and cellular composition of intestinal organoids derived from pig, a valuable model of Humans. Organoids were derived from jejunal and colonic ISC obtained from 1, 7, 28, 36 and 180-day old pigs and passaged three times. We first confirmed by qPCR that the expression of 18% of the &gt;80 studied genes related to various intestinal functions differed between jejunal and colonic organoids after two passages (P&lt;0.05). Growth and morphology of organoids depended on intestinal location (greater number and larger organoids derived from colonic than jejunal ISC, P&lt;0.05) but also pig age. Indeed, when ISC were derived from young piglets, the ratio of organoids to spheroids was greater (P&lt;0.05), spheroids were larger during the primary culture but smaller after two passages (P&lt;0.05) and organoids smaller after one passage (P&gt;0.05) compared to ISC from older pigs. Finally, no difference in cellular composition, evaluated by immunostaining of markers of the major intestinal cell types (absorptive, enteroendocrine and goblet cells) were observed between organoids originating from 7 or 180-day old pigs, while difference between intestinal site origin were noticed. In conclusion, while the age of the tissue donor affected organoid growth and morphology, it did not influence their phenotype.</p>
