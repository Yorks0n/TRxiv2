C.\nScore: 43.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547547\nLoss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.\nInhibition of skeletal muscle Lands cycle ameliorates weakness induced by physical inactivity\nAuthors: Shahtout, J. L.; Eshima, H.; Ferrara, P. J.; Maschek, J. A.; Cox, J. E.; Drummond, M. J.; Funai, K.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550576\nBackgroundLipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) have been implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy with age and disuse. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an enzyme of Lands cycle, conjugates a polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain to a lysophospholipid (PUFA-PL) molecule, providing substrates for LOOH propagation. Previous studies suggest that inhibition of Lands cycle is an effective strategy to suppress LOOH. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific tamoxifen-inducible knockout of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKO) were utilized to determine if muscle-specific attenuation of LOOH may alleviate muscle atrophy and weakness with disuse. MethodsLPCAT3-MKO and control mice underwent 7 days of sham or hindlimb unloading (HU model) to study muscle mass and force-generating capacity. LOOH was assessed by quantifying 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-conjugated peptides. Quantitative PCR and lipid mass spectrometry were used to validate LPCAT3 deletion. Results7 days of HU was sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and weakness concomitant to an increase in 4-HNE. Deletion of LPCAT3 reversed HU-induced increase in muscle 4HNE. No difference was found in body mass, body composition, or caloric intake between genotypes. The soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PLANT) muscles of the LPCAT3-MKO mice were partially protected from atrophy compared to controls, concomitant to attenuated decrease in cross-sectional areas in type I and IIa fibers. Strikingly, SOL and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were robustly protected from HU-induced reduction in force-generating capacity in the LPCAT3-MKO mice compared to controls. ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that attenuation of muscle LOOH is sufficient to restore skeletal muscle function, in particular a protection from reduction in muscle specific force. Thus, muscle LOOH contributes to atrophy and weakness induced by HU in mice.\nEarly-life stress triggers long-lasting organismal resilience and longevity via tetraspanin\nAuthors: Jiang, W. I.; Belly, H. D.; Wang, B. K.; Wong, A.; Kim, M.; Oh, F.; DeGeorge, J.; Huang, X.; Guang, S.; Weiner, O. K.; Ma, D. K.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550452\nEarly-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.\nGSK3 inhibition improves skeletal muscle function and whole-body metabolism in the severe DBA/2J mdx mouse model\nAuthors: Marcella, B. M.; Hockey, B.; Braun, J. L.; Whitley, K. C.; Geromella, M. S.; Baranowski, R. W.; Watson, C. J.; Silvera, S.; Hamstra, S. I.; Wasilewicz, L. J.; Crozier, R. W.; Marais, A. A.; Vandenboom, R.; Roy, B. D.; MacNeil, A. J.; MacPherson, R. E.; Fajardo, V.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.16.480726\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked muscle wasting disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 males worldwide. It is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which compromises muscle integrity, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for patients with DMD as they delay the loss of ambulation by an average of 3 years; however, they are also associated with adverse effects such as insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Thus, alternative therapeutic options should be explored. Here, we show that treating the DBA/2J mdx mouse with the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor, tideglusib, improved skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity, while also attenuating the hypermetabolic phenotype previously observed in these mice. Furthermore, treating mdx mice with the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, augmented the benefits of voluntary wheel running on insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle function despite running half of the total distance compared to control-treated mdx mice. This is important given that some patients with DMD may not be able to engage in adequate amounts of physical activity. Thus, GSK3 inhibition alone or in combination with exercise can enhance skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity in mdx mice.\nVhl deletion in Dmp1-expressing cells alters MEP metabolism and promotes stress erythropoiesis\nAuthors: Emery, J. M.; Chicana, B.; Taglinao, H.; Ponce, C.; Donham, C.; Padmore, H.; Sebastian, A.; Trasti, S. L.; Manilay, J. O.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550559\nIn recent years, general hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzyme inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia due to renal disease and osteoporosis. However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis. Key Points* Dysregulation of HIF signaling in Dmp1+ bone cells induces stress erythropoiesis. * Skeletal homeostasis modulates erythropoiesis.\nHip thrust and back squat training elicit similar gluteus muscle hypertrophy and transfer similarly to the deadlift\nAuthors: Plotkin, D. L.; Rodas, M. A.; Vigotsky, A.; McIntosh, M. C.; Breeze, E.; Ubrik, R.; Robitzsch, C.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Mattingly, M. L.; Michel, J. M.; Kontos, N. J.; Fruge, A. D.; Wilburn, C. M.; Weimar, W. H.; Bashir, A.; Beyers, R. J.; Henselmans, M.; Contreras, B. M.; Roberts, M. D.\nScore: 81.6, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nCircadian proteomics reveal rampant tuning of post-transcriptional apparatus by Chlamydomonas clock\nAuthors: Jadhav, D. B.; Roy, S.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550970\nTiming of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earths rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often dont concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified \u003e1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, \u003e40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and \u003e 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonass unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.\nCellular traits regulate fluorescence-based bio-optical phenotypes of coral photosymbionts living in-hospite\nAuthors: McQuagge, A.; Pahl, K. B.; Wong, S.; Melman, T.; Linn, L.; Lowry, S.; Hoadley, K.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547959\nAbstractDiversity across algal family Symbiodiniaceae contributes to the environmental resilience of certain coral species. Chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements are frequently used to determine symbiont health and resilience, but more work is needed to refine these tools and establish how they relate to underlying cellular traits. We examined trait diversity in symbionts from the generas Cladocopium and Durusdinium, collected from 12 aquacultured coral species. Photophysiological metrics ({Phi}PSII, {sigma}PSII, {rho}, {tau}1, {tau}2, ABQ, NPQ, and qP) were assessed using a prototype multi-spectral fluorometer over a variable light protocol which yielded a total of 1360 individual metrics. Photophysiological metrics were then used to establish four unique phenotypic variants. Corals harboring C15 were predominantly found within a single phenotype which clustered separately from all other coral fragments. The majority of Durusdinium dominated colonies also formed a separate phenotype which it shared with a few C1 dominated corals. C15 and D1 symbionts appear to differ in which mechanisms they employ to dissipate excess light energy. Spectrally dependent variability is also observed across phenotypes that may relate to differences in photopigment utilization. Cell physiology (atomic C:N:P, cell size, chlorophyll-a, neutral lipid content) was also assessed within each sample and differ across phenotypes, linking photophysiological metrics with underlying primary cellular traits. Strong correlations between first- and second-order traits, such as Quantum Yield and cellular N:P content, or light dissipation pathways (qP and NPQ) and C:P underline differences across symbiont types and may also provide a means for using fluorescence-based metrics as biomarkers for certain primary-cellular traits.\nAnalysis of RyR2 distribution in HEK293 cells and mouse cardiac myocytes using 3D MINFLUX microscopy\nAuthors: Clowsley, A. H.; Meletiou, A.; Lucinskaite, E.; Jansen, I.; Jones, P. P.; Louch, W. E.; Soeller, C.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550636\nThe cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2+ enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2+ sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2+ handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.\nIdentifying novel links between cardiovascular disease and insomnia by Drosophila modeling of genes from a pleiotropic GWAS locus\nAuthors: Melkani, G. C.; Abou Daya, F.; Ober, L.; Patel, D.; Mandigo, T.; Maher, M.; Tchio, C.; Walker, J. A.; Saxena, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550429\nBackgroundInsomnia symptoms have been associated with CVD, doubling the risk of incident CVD, but specific shared pathways remain poorly understood. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic loci significantly associated with insomnia symptoms, including one locus that was previously associated with CVD in an independent GWAS. MethodsTo evaluate the cell-autonomous role of genes near the CVD- and insomnia-related locus, we used Drosophila melanogaster models to perform tissue-specific RNAi knockdown of these genes in the heart and neurons. We also performed suppression of these genes in the heart or neurons, and assessed sleep or cardiac function, respectively, to identify non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. ResultsOur results show that neuronal and cardiac-specific RNAi knockdown of four genes conserved in Drosophila, Lsn, ATPSynC, Bruce, and Imp, contributes to compromised sleep and cardiac performance, respectively. Cardiac-specific knockdown of Lsn led to significant cardiac dilation and reduced cardiac performance. Knockdown of ATPSynC led to significantly reduced cardiac performance without dilations. Furthermore, Lsn and ATPSynC-suppressed hearts showed disruption in the actin-containing myofibrillar organization and led to a significantly shortened lifespan. Suppression of Lsn increased pericardin deposition, indicative of a fibrotic phenotype. Neuronal-specific knockdown of ATPSynC, Imp, and Lsn led to compromised sleep. Moreover, the knockdown of Imp in the brain led to a significantly compromised cardiac function characterized by decreased systolic and diastolic intervals and fractional shortening in a non-cell autonomous manner. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bruce, ATPSynC, and Lsn in the heart led to compromised sleep characterized by decreased activity and daytime activity and increased bin number in a non-cell autonomous manner. ConclusionsOur study provides novel insights into genetic mechanisms linking CVD and insomnia, highlighting the importance of these four conserved genes in the development and association of both diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) have been implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy with age and disuse. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an enzyme of Lands cycle, conjugates a polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain to a lysophospholipid (PUFA-PL) molecule, providing substrates for LOOH propagation. Previous studies suggest that inhibition of Lands cycle is an effective strategy to suppress LOOH. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific tamoxifen-inducible knockout of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKO) were utilized to determine if muscle-specific attenuation of LOOH may alleviate muscle atrophy and weakness with disuse.

MethodsLPCAT3-MKO and control mice underwent 7 days of sham or hindlimb unloading (HU model) to study muscle mass and force-generating capacity. LOOH was assessed by quantifying 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-conjugated peptides. Quantitative PCR and lipid mass spectrometry were used to validate LPCAT3 deletion.

Results7 days of HU was sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and weakness concomitant to an increase in 4-HNE. Deletion of LPCAT3 reversed HU-induced increase in muscle 4HNE. No difference was found in body mass, body composition, or caloric intake between genotypes. The soleus (SOL) and plantaris (PLANT) muscles of the LPCAT3-MKO mice were partially protected from atrophy compared to controls, concomitant to attenuated decrease in cross-sectional areas in type I and IIa fibers. Strikingly, SOL and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were robustly protected from HU-induced reduction in force-generating capacity in the LPCAT3-MKO mice compared to controls.

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that attenuation of muscle LOOH is sufficient to restore skeletal muscle function, in particular a protection from reduction in muscle specific force. Thus, muscle LOOH contributes to atrophy and weakness induced by HU in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked muscle wasting disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 males worldwide. It is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which compromises muscle integrity, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for patients with DMD as they delay the loss of ambulation by an average of 3 years; however, they are also associated with adverse effects such as insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Thus, alternative therapeutic options should be explored. Here, we show that treating the DBA/2J mdx mouse with the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor, tideglusib, improved skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity, while also attenuating the hypermetabolic phenotype previously observed in these mice. Furthermore, treating mdx mice with the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, augmented the benefits of voluntary wheel running on insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle function despite running half of the total distance compared to control-treated mdx mice. This is important given that some patients with DMD may not be able to engage in adequate amounts of physical activity. Thus, GSK3 inhibition alone or in combination with exercise can enhance skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity in mdx mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, general hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzyme inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia due to renal disease and osteoporosis. However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis.

Key Points* Dysregulation of HIF signaling in Dmp1&#43; bone cells induces stress erythropoiesis.

* Skeletal homeostasis modulates erythropoiesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Timing of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earths rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often dont concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified &gt;1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, &gt;40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and &gt; 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonass unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractDiversity across algal family Symbiodiniaceae contributes to the environmental resilience of certain coral species. Chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements are frequently used to determine symbiont health and resilience, but more work is needed to refine these tools and establish how they relate to underlying cellular traits. We examined trait diversity in symbionts from the generas Cladocopium and Durusdinium, collected from 12 aquacultured coral species. Photophysiological metrics ({Phi}PSII, {sigma}PSII, {rho}, {tau}1, {tau}2, ABQ, NPQ, and qP) were assessed using a prototype multi-spectral fluorometer over a variable light protocol which yielded a total of 1360 individual metrics. Photophysiological metrics were then used to establish four unique phenotypic variants. Corals harboring C15 were predominantly found within a single phenotype which clustered separately from all other coral fragments. The majority of Durusdinium dominated colonies also formed a separate phenotype which it shared with a few C1 dominated corals. C15 and D1 symbionts appear to differ in which mechanisms they employ to dissipate excess light energy. Spectrally dependent variability is also observed across phenotypes that may relate to differences in photopigment utilization. Cell physiology (atomic C:N:P, cell size, chlorophyll-a, neutral lipid content) was also assessed within each sample and differ across phenotypes, linking photophysiological metrics with underlying primary cellular traits. Strong correlations between first- and second-order traits, such as Quantum Yield and cellular N:P content, or light dissipation pathways (qP and NPQ) and C:P underline differences across symbiont types and may also provide a means for using fluorescence-based metrics as biomarkers for certain primary-cellular traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2&#43; enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2&#43; sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2&#43; handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInsomnia symptoms have been associated with CVD, doubling the risk of incident CVD, but specific shared pathways remain poorly understood. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic loci significantly associated with insomnia symptoms, including one locus that was previously associated with CVD in an independent GWAS.

MethodsTo evaluate the cell-autonomous role of genes near the CVD- and insomnia-related locus, we used Drosophila melanogaster models to perform tissue-specific RNAi knockdown of these genes in the heart and neurons. We also performed suppression of these genes in the heart or neurons, and assessed sleep or cardiac function, respectively, to identify non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.

ResultsOur results show that neuronal and cardiac-specific RNAi knockdown of four genes conserved in Drosophila, Lsn, ATPSynC, Bruce, and Imp, contributes to compromised sleep and cardiac performance, respectively. Cardiac-specific knockdown of Lsn led to significant cardiac dilation and reduced cardiac performance. Knockdown of ATPSynC led to significantly reduced cardiac performance without dilations. Furthermore, Lsn and ATPSynC-suppressed hearts showed disruption in the actin-containing myofibrillar organization and led to a significantly shortened lifespan. Suppression of Lsn increased pericardin deposition, indicative of a fibrotic phenotype. Neuronal-specific knockdown of ATPSynC, Imp, and Lsn led to compromised sleep. Moreover, the knockdown of Imp in the brain led to a significantly compromised cardiac function characterized by decreased systolic and diastolic intervals and fractional shortening in a non-cell autonomous manner. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bruce, ATPSynC, and Lsn in the heart led to compromised sleep characterized by decreased activity and daytime activity and increased bin number in a non-cell autonomous manner.

ConclusionsOur study provides novel insights into genetic mechanisms linking CVD and insomnia, highlighting the importance of these four conserved genes in the development and association of both diseases.</p>
