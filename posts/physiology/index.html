V.; Zandawala, M.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579245\nInsects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain their nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. While the identities and functions of various insect metabolic and diuretic hormones have been well-established, the characterization of an anti-diuretic signaling system that is conserved across most insects is still lacking. To address this, here we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in Drosophila. The Drosophila ITP gene encodes five transcript variants which generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. Using a combination of anatomical mapping and single-cell transcriptome analyses, we comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa is released during dehydration and recombinant Drosophila ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach and the ex vivo secretion assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as an elusive Drosophila ITPa receptor. Thus, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules abolishes the inhibitory effect of ITPa on diuretic hormone secretion. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with ITPa overexpression in ITP neurons. Interestingly, ITPa-Gyc76C pathways deciphered here are reminiscent of the atrial natriuretic peptide signaling in mammals. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify synaptic and paracrine pathways upstream and downstream of ITP-expressing neurons. Taken together, our systematic characterization of the ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila.\nMUC17 is an essential small intestinal glycocalyx component that is disrupted in Crohn's disease\nAuthors: Layunta, E.; Javerfelt, S.; van de Koolwijk, F. C.; Sivertsson, M.; Dolan, B.; Arike, L.; Thulin, S.; Vallance, B. A.; Pelaseyed, T.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.578867\nCrohns disease (CD) is the chronic inflammation of the ileum and colon triggered by bacteria, but insights into molecular perturbations at the bacteria-epithelium interface are limited. We report that membrane mucin MUC17 protects small intestinal enterocytes against commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In non-inflamed CD ileum, reduced MUC17 levels correlated with a compromised glycocalyx, allowing bacterial contact with enterocytes. Muc17 deletion in mice rendered the small intestine prone to atypical infection while maintaining resistance to colitis. The loss of Muc17 resulted in spontaneous deterioration of epithelial homeostasis and extra-intestinal translocation of bacteria. Finally, Muc17-deficient mice harbored specific small intestinal bacterial taxa observed in CD. Our findings highlight MUC17 as an essential line of defense in the small intestine with relevance for early epithelial defects in CD. One-sentence summaryMembrane mucin MUC17 protects enterocytes against bacterial attachment and constitutes an early defect in Crohns disease.\nScrutinizing science to save lives: uncovering flaws in the data linking L-type calcium channels blockers to CRAC channels and heart failure.\nAuthors: Bird, G. S.; Lin, Y.-P.; Tucker, C. J.; Mueller, G.; Shi, M.; Padmanabhan, S.; Parekh, A. B.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579229\nHypertension is estimated to affect almost 1 billion people globally and significantly increases risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, retinopathy and kidney disease. One major front line therapy that has been used for over 50 years involves L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). One class of LCCBs is the dihydropyridine family, with amlodipine being widely prescribed regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or age. In 2020, Johnson et al.7 reported that all LCCBs significantly increased the risk of heart failure, and attributed this effect to non-canonical activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. A major approach on which they based many of their arguments was to measure cytosolic Ca2+ using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2. We recently demonstrated that amlodipine is highly fluorescent within cells and overwhelms the fura-2 signal, precluding the use of the indicator dye with amlodipine24. Our meta-analyses and prospective real world study showed that dihydropyridines were not associated with an increase in heart failure, likely explained by the lack of consideration by Johnson et al.7 of well-known confounding factors such as age, race, obesity, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or diabetes24. Trebak and colleagues have responded to our paper with a forthright and unwavering defence of their work27. In this paper, we carry out a forensic dissection of Johnson et al.,7 and conduct new experiments that address directly points raised by Trebak et al. 27. We show that there are major flaws in the design and interpretation of their key experiments, that fura-2 cannot be used with amlodipine, that there are fundamental mathematical misunderstandings and mistakes throughout their study leading to critical calculations on heart failure that are demonstrably wrong, and several of their own results are inconsistent with their interpretation. We therefore believe the study by Johnson et al. 7 is flawed at many levels and we stand by our conclusions.\nNo cardiac phase bias for threat perception under naturalistic conditions in immersive virtual reality\nAuthors: Klotzsche, F.; Motyka, P.; Molak, A.; Sahula, V.; Darmova, B.; Byrnes, C.; Fajnerova, I.; Gaebler, M.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578172\nPrevious studies have found that threatening stimuli are more readily perceived and more intensely experienced when presented during cardiac systole compared to diastole. Also, threatening stimuli are judged as physically closer than neutral ones. In a pre-registered study, we tested these effects and their interaction using a naturalistic (interactive, 3D) experimental design in immersive virtual reality: We briefly displayed threatening and non-threatening animals (four each) at varying distances (1.5-5.5 meters) to a group of young, healthy participants (n = 41), while recording their ECGs (electrocardiograms). Participants then pointed to the location where they had seen the animal (ca. 29k trials in total). Our pre-registered analyses indicated that perceived distances to both threatening and non-threatening animals did not differ significantly between cardiac phases - with Bayesian analysis supporting the null hypothesis. There was also no evidence for an association between subjective fear and perceived proximity to threatening animals. These results contrast with previous findings that used verbal or declarative distance measures in less naturalistic experimental conditions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the cardiac phase-related variation in threat processing may not generalize across different paradigms and may be less relevant in naturalistic scenarios than under more abstract experimental conditions. Impact statementTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the influence of interoceptive cardiac signals on visual perception using naturalistic stimuli in immersive virtual reality. We based the design of our experiment on previous reports about threat processing biases and the role of the cardiac cycle but did not observe the expected effects. This poses the question of their generalizability from abstract settings to more naturalistic setups, featuring greater behavioral engagement and a richer sensory environment.\nOn-farm hatching and contact with adult hen post hatch induce sex-dependent effects on performance and welfare in broiler chickens\nAuthors: Guilloteau, L. A.; Bertin, A.; Crochet, S.; Bagnard, C.; Hondelatte, A.; Ravon, L.; Schouler, C.; Germain, K.; Collin, A.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-02-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.17.541117\nTo improve the early perinatal conditions of broiler chicks, alternative hatching systems have been developed. On-farm hatching (OFH) with an enriched microbial and stimulating environment by the presence of an adult hen is a promising solution. Day-old chicks were allotted within five hatching and rearing conditions: OFH, conventional hatchery (CH), CH and post-hatching treatment with antibiotics (CH + AB), as well as both hatching systems with an adult hen at hatching (OFH + H, CH + H). To challenge the robustness of chickens, they were exposed on D27 to suboptimal rearing conditions by combining for 4 h transport in boxes in a new room at a lower temperature and fasting. On their return to the original room, the chicken density was increased, and birds were orally vaccinated with the Gumboro vaccine. The impacts of these conditions on hatchability, chick quality score, performance, health and robustness were determined. The OFH chick body weights (BWs) were significantly greater than those of CH chicks at hatching. Whereas there was no effect of hatching conditions, the presence of hens decreased the hatchability rate, the quality score of OFH chicks and increased mortality at hatching. Treatment of CH chicks with antibiotics (CH + AB) temporarily decreased chicken BW at D19, but the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not modified. At D19, OFH chicks had the highest BW compared to the other groups, and the presence of hens at hatching harmed chicken BW regardless of the hatching condition and FCR. An interaction between the effect of experimental rearing conditions and chicken sex was observed later for BW. In males, the OFH chickens were the heaviest compared to the other groups at D34 but not at D56. The presence of hens negatively impacted CH chicken BW at D56. In females, there was no effect of hatching condition on the BWs at D34 and D56, and the presence of hens had a positive impact on OFH chicken BW. There was no effect of hatching conditions on health parameters. In conclusion, the OFH system was a hatching system at least equivalent to the CH system. The presence of the hen at hatching and during the chick start-up phase on performance interacted with the hatching condition and the sex of the chickens.\nOn-farm hatching and contact with adult hen post hatch induce sex-dependent effects on performance and welfare in broiler chickens\nAuthors: Guilloteau, L.

G. R.; Hughes, M. C.; Ramos, S. V.; Brahmbhatt, A.; Turnbull, P. C.; Polidovitch, N.; Garibotti, M. C.; Schlattner, U.; Hawke, T. J.; Simpson, J. A.; Backx, P. H.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578832\nMitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the \"fast\" export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such \"creatine-dependent\" phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. Here, we determined whether such attenuations occur in later stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age) in relation to mtCK thiol redox state, and whether this pathway could be preserved through administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20, in the D2.mdx mouse. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that aged male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H2O2 emission (mH2O2). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH2O2 was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). We then found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4 to [~]12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH2O2 only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation, which can be preserved with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationships between redox stress and metabolic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency that can be targeted with small peptide therapeutics.\nAugmented-reality-based exercise increases salivary oxytocin\nAuthors: Shima, T.; Iijima, J.; Sutoh, H.; Terashima, C.; Matsuura, Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579578\nPurposeThe secretion of oxytocin, which is linked to social interaction, plays a significant role in enhancing human well-being. The utilization of augmented reality (AR) systems can facilitate sustained social interaction irrespective of physical distance. While exercise and sports activities are known to promote oxytocin secretion, the potential benefits of exercise combined with AR remain to be fully explored. MethodsIn a randomized crossover trial, fourteen participants underwent three different regimens: non-exercise (rest), standard cycling exercise (Ex), and cycling exercise combined with AR (Ex+AR). In both exercise conditions (Ex and Ex+AR), participants engaged in self-paced cycling exercises to maintain a Rating of Perceived Exertion of 10. In the Ex+AR condition, participants avatars were projected onto the tablet screen as they cycled alongside ten other avatars in AR. Saliva samples and mood states (assessed using POMS2) were collected before and immediately after each 10-minute regimen. Subsequently, the levels of salivary oxytocin were measured. ResultsThe participants demonstrated a faster speed during Ex+AR compared to Ex, despite there was no difference in self-administered fatigue levels between the two groups. Notably, Ex+AR led to a significant elevation in salivary oxytocin levels, whereas Ex showed a trend toward an increase. Furthermore, only Ex+AR significantly ameliorated mood states related to depression-dejection and exhibited a trend toward suppressing anger-hostility. ConclusionThese results indicate that Ex+AR facilitates oxytocin secretion and enhances mood states. Employing the Ex+AR system could be a promising means to foster social interaction, transcending physical distances.\nA Specialized Centrosome-Proteasome Axis Mediates Proteostasis and Influences Cardiac Stress through Txlnb\nAuthors: McLendon, J. M.; Zhang, X.; Stein, C. C.; Baehr, L. M.; Bodine, S. C.; Boudreau, R. L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.580020\nBackgroundCentrosomes localize to perinuclear foci where they serve multifunctional roles, arranging the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and anchoring ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) machinery. In mature cardiomyocytes, centrosomal proteins redistribute into a specialized perinuclear cage-like structure, and a potential centrosome-UPS interface has not been studied. Taxilin-beta (Txlnb), a cardiomyocyte-enriched protein, belongs to a family of centrosome adapter proteins implicated in protein quality control. We hypothesize that Txlnb plays a key role in centrosomal-proteasomal crosstalk in cardiomyocytes. MethodsIntegrative bioinformatics assessed centrosomal gene dysregulation in failing hearts. Txlnb gain/loss-of-function studies were conducted in cultured cardiomyocytes and mice. Txlnbs role in cardiac proteotoxicity and hypertrophy was examined using CryAB-R120G mice and transverse aortic constriction (TAC), respectively. Molecular modeling investigated Txlnb structure/function. ResultsHuman failing hearts show consistent dysregulation of many centrosome-associated genes, alongside UPS-related genes. Txlnb emerged as a candidate regulator of cardiomyocyte proteostasis that localizes to the perinuclear centrosomal compartment. Txlnbs interactome strongly supports its involvement in cytoskeletal, microtubule, and UPS processes, particularly centrosome-related functions. Overexpressing Txlnb in cardiomyocytes reduced ubiquitinated protein accumulation and enhanced proteasome activity during hypertrophy. Txlnb-knockout (KO) mouse hearts exhibit proteasomal insufficiency and altered cardiac growth, evidenced by ubiquitinated protein accumulation, decreased 26S{beta}5 proteasome activity, and lower mass with age. In Cryab-R120G mice, Txlnb loss worsened heart failure, causing lower ejection fractions. After TAC, Txlnb-KO mice also showed reduced ejection fraction, increased heart mass, and elevated ubiquitinated protein accumulation. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms revealed that Txlnb-KO did not affect proteasomal subunit expression but led to the upregulation of Txlna and several centrosomal proteins (Cep63, Ofd1, and Tubg) suggesting altered centrosomal dynamics. Structural predictions support Txlnbs role as a specialized centrosomal-adapter protein bridging centrosomes with proteasomes, confirmed by microtubule-dependent perinuclear localization. ConclusionsTogether, these data provide initial evidence connecting Txlnb to cardiac proteostasis, hinting at the potential importance of functional bridging between specialized centrosomes and UPS in cardiomyocytes.\nAge, not body size, influences flight distance in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)\nAuthors: Gilgenreiner, M.; Kurze, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579366\nBumble bees and honey bees provide crucial pollination service and have become important insect model system. Despite their close relation, they differ in their morphology, physiology, and social organisation. Notably, honey bees workers exhibit age-based polyethism, while bumble bees display considerable body size variation. Though body size is known to affect foraging range, behaviour, and flight ability, the influence of age remains less explored. Here we studied the flight performance (distance and speed) in aging bumble bee workers using tethered flight mills. Additionally, we measured their intertegular distance (ITD), dry mass, and fat content. Flight distance was predominantly influenced by age, challenging assumptions that age does not play a role in foraging and task allocation. Between 7 to 14 days, flight distance increased six-fold before a slight decline at the age of 21 days, aligning with age-dependent flight physiology in honey bees. Larger workers had decreasing mass-specific fat reserves, challenging the notion about their energy preservation for oocyte development. Our findings indicate that age substantially influences flight distance, impacting foraging performance and potentially altering task allocation strategies. This underscores the need to consider individual age and physiological changes alongside body size and mass in experiments involving bumble bee workers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Insects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain their nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. While the identities and functions of various insect metabolic and diuretic hormones have been well-established, the characterization of an anti-diuretic signaling system that is conserved across most insects is still lacking. To address this, here we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in Drosophila. The Drosophila ITP gene encodes five transcript variants which generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. Using a combination of anatomical mapping and single-cell transcriptome analyses, we comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa is released during dehydration and recombinant Drosophila ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach and the ex vivo secretion assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as an elusive Drosophila ITPa receptor. Thus, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules abolishes the inhibitory effect of ITPa on diuretic hormone secretion. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with ITPa overexpression in ITP neurons. Interestingly, ITPa-Gyc76C pathways deciphered here are reminiscent of the atrial natriuretic peptide signaling in mammals. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify synaptic and paracrine pathways upstream and downstream of ITP-expressing neurons. Taken together, our systematic characterization of the ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crohns disease (CD) is the chronic inflammation of the ileum and colon triggered by bacteria, but insights into molecular perturbations at the bacteria-epithelium interface are limited. We report that membrane mucin MUC17 protects small intestinal enterocytes against commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In non-inflamed CD ileum, reduced MUC17 levels correlated with a compromised glycocalyx, allowing bacterial contact with enterocytes. Muc17 deletion in mice rendered the small intestine prone to atypical infection while maintaining resistance to colitis. The loss of Muc17 resulted in spontaneous deterioration of epithelial homeostasis and extra-intestinal translocation of bacteria. Finally, Muc17-deficient mice harbored specific small intestinal bacterial taxa observed in CD. Our findings highlight MUC17 as an essential line of defense in the small intestine with relevance for early epithelial defects in CD.

        <p class="abstract">Hypertension is estimated to affect almost 1 billion people globally and significantly increases risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, retinopathy and kidney disease. One major front line therapy that has been used for over 50 years involves L-type Ca2&#43; channel blockers (LCCBs). One class of LCCBs is the dihydropyridine family, with amlodipine being widely prescribed regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or age. In 2020, Johnson et al.7 reported that all LCCBs significantly increased the risk of heart failure, and attributed this effect to non-canonical activation of store-operated Ca2&#43; entry. A major approach on which they based many of their arguments was to measure cytosolic Ca2&#43; using the fluorescent Ca2&#43; indicator dye fura-2. We recently demonstrated that amlodipine is highly fluorescent within cells and overwhelms the fura-2 signal, precluding the use of the indicator dye with amlodipine24. Our meta-analyses and prospective real world study showed that dihydropyridines were not associated with an increase in heart failure, likely explained by the lack of consideration by Johnson et al.7 of well-known confounding factors such as age, race, obesity, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or diabetes24. Trebak and colleagues have responded to our paper with a forthright and unwavering defence of their work27. In this paper, we carry out a forensic dissection of Johnson et al.,7 and conduct new experiments that address directly points raised by Trebak et al. 27. We show that there are major flaws in the design and interpretation of their key experiments, that fura-2 cannot be used with amlodipine, that there are fundamental mathematical misunderstandings and mistakes throughout their study leading to critical calculations on heart failure that are demonstrably wrong, and several of their own results are inconsistent with their interpretation. We therefore believe the study by Johnson et al. 7 is flawed at many levels and we stand by our conclusions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previous studies have found that threatening stimuli are more readily perceived and more intensely experienced when presented during cardiac systole compared to diastole. Also, threatening stimuli are judged as physically closer than neutral ones. In a pre-registered study, we tested these effects and their interaction using a naturalistic (interactive, 3D) experimental design in immersive virtual reality: We briefly displayed threatening and non-threatening animals (four each) at varying distances (1.5-5.5 meters) to a group of young, healthy participants (n = 41), while recording their ECGs (electrocardiograms). Participants then pointed to the location where they had seen the animal (ca. 29k trials in total). Our pre-registered analyses indicated that perceived distances to both threatening and non-threatening animals did not differ significantly between cardiac phases - with Bayesian analysis supporting the null hypothesis. There was also no evidence for an association between subjective fear and perceived proximity to threatening animals. These results contrast with previous findings that used verbal or declarative distance measures in less naturalistic experimental conditions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the cardiac phase-related variation in threat processing may not generalize across different paradigms and may be less relevant in naturalistic scenarios than under more abstract experimental conditions.

Impact statementTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the influence of interoceptive cardiac signals on visual perception using naturalistic stimuli in immersive virtual reality. We based the design of our experiment on previous reports about threat processing biases and the role of the cardiac cycle but did not observe the expected effects. This poses the question of their generalizability from abstract settings to more naturalistic setups, featuring greater behavioral engagement and a richer sensory environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To improve the early perinatal conditions of broiler chicks, alternative hatching systems have been developed. On-farm hatching (OFH) with an enriched microbial and stimulating environment by the presence of an adult hen is a promising solution. Day-old chicks were allotted within five hatching and rearing conditions: OFH, conventional hatchery (CH), CH and post-hatching treatment with antibiotics (CH &#43; AB), as well as both hatching systems with an adult hen at hatching (OFH &#43; H, CH &#43; H). To challenge the robustness of chickens, they were exposed on D27 to suboptimal rearing conditions by combining for 4 h transport in boxes in a new room at a lower temperature and fasting. On their return to the original room, the chicken density was increased, and birds were orally vaccinated with the Gumboro vaccine. The impacts of these conditions on hatchability, chick quality score, performance, health and robustness were determined. The OFH chick body weights (BWs) were significantly greater than those of CH chicks at hatching. Whereas there was no effect of hatching conditions, the presence of hens decreased the hatchability rate, the quality score of OFH chicks and increased mortality at hatching. Treatment of CH chicks with antibiotics (CH &#43; AB) temporarily decreased chicken BW at D19, but the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not modified. At D19, OFH chicks had the highest BW compared to the other groups, and the presence of hens at hatching harmed chicken BW regardless of the hatching condition and FCR. An interaction between the effect of experimental rearing conditions and chicken sex was observed later for BW. In males, the OFH chickens were the heaviest compared to the other groups at D34 but not at D56. The presence of hens negatively impacted CH chicken BW at D56. In females, there was no effect of hatching condition on the BWs at D34 and D56, and the presence of hens had a positive impact on OFH chicken BW. There was no effect of hatching conditions on health parameters. In conclusion, the OFH system was a hatching system at least equivalent to the CH system. The presence of the hen at hatching and during the chick start-up phase on performance interacted with the hatching condition and the sex of the chickens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the &#34;fast&#34; export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such &#34;creatine-dependent&#34; phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. Here, we determined whether such attenuations occur in later stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age) in relation to mtCK thiol redox state, and whether this pathway could be preserved through administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20, in the D2.mdx mouse. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that aged male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H2O2 emission (mH2O2). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH2O2 was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). We then found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4 to [~]12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH2O2 only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation, which can be preserved with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationships between redox stress and metabolic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency that can be targeted with small peptide therapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThe secretion of oxytocin, which is linked to social interaction, plays a significant role in enhancing human well-being. The utilization of augmented reality (AR) systems can facilitate sustained social interaction irrespective of physical distance. While exercise and sports activities are known to promote oxytocin secretion, the potential benefits of exercise combined with AR remain to be fully explored.

MethodsIn a randomized crossover trial, fourteen participants underwent three different regimens: non-exercise (rest), standard cycling exercise (Ex), and cycling exercise combined with AR (Ex&#43;AR). In both exercise conditions (Ex and Ex&#43;AR), participants engaged in self-paced cycling exercises to maintain a Rating of Perceived Exertion of 10. In the Ex&#43;AR condition, participants avatars were projected onto the tablet screen as they cycled alongside ten other avatars in AR. Saliva samples and mood states (assessed using POMS2) were collected before and immediately after each 10-minute regimen. Subsequently, the levels of salivary oxytocin were measured.

ResultsThe participants demonstrated a faster speed during Ex&#43;AR compared to Ex, despite there was no difference in self-administered fatigue levels between the two groups. Notably, Ex&#43;AR led to a significant elevation in salivary oxytocin levels, whereas Ex showed a trend toward an increase. Furthermore, only Ex&#43;AR significantly ameliorated mood states related to depression-dejection and exhibited a trend toward suppressing anger-hostility.

ConclusionThese results indicate that Ex&#43;AR facilitates oxytocin secretion and enhances mood states. Employing the Ex&#43;AR system could be a promising means to foster social interaction, transcending physical distances.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCentrosomes localize to perinuclear foci where they serve multifunctional roles, arranging the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and anchoring ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) machinery. In mature cardiomyocytes, centrosomal proteins redistribute into a specialized perinuclear cage-like structure, and a potential centrosome-UPS interface has not been studied. Taxilin-beta (Txlnb), a cardiomyocyte-enriched protein, belongs to a family of centrosome adapter proteins implicated in protein quality control. We hypothesize that Txlnb plays a key role in centrosomal-proteasomal crosstalk in cardiomyocytes.

MethodsIntegrative bioinformatics assessed centrosomal gene dysregulation in failing hearts. Txlnb gain/loss-of-function studies were conducted in cultured cardiomyocytes and mice. Txlnbs role in cardiac proteotoxicity and hypertrophy was examined using CryAB-R120G mice and transverse aortic constriction (TAC), respectively. Molecular modeling investigated Txlnb structure/function.

ResultsHuman failing hearts show consistent dysregulation of many centrosome-associated genes, alongside UPS-related genes. Txlnb emerged as a candidate regulator of cardiomyocyte proteostasis that localizes to the perinuclear centrosomal compartment. Txlnbs interactome strongly supports its involvement in cytoskeletal, microtubule, and UPS processes, particularly centrosome-related functions. Overexpressing Txlnb in cardiomyocytes reduced ubiquitinated protein accumulation and enhanced proteasome activity during hypertrophy. Txlnb-knockout (KO) mouse hearts exhibit proteasomal insufficiency and altered cardiac growth, evidenced by ubiquitinated protein accumulation, decreased 26S{beta}5 proteasome activity, and lower mass with age. In Cryab-R120G mice, Txlnb loss worsened heart failure, causing lower ejection fractions. After TAC, Txlnb-KO mice also showed reduced ejection fraction, increased heart mass, and elevated ubiquitinated protein accumulation. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms revealed that Txlnb-KO did not affect proteasomal subunit expression but led to the upregulation of Txlna and several centrosomal proteins (Cep63, Ofd1, and Tubg) suggesting altered centrosomal dynamics. Structural predictions support Txlnbs role as a specialized centrosomal-adapter protein bridging centrosomes with proteasomes, confirmed by microtubule-dependent perinuclear localization.

ConclusionsTogether, these data provide initial evidence connecting Txlnb to cardiac proteostasis, hinting at the potential importance of functional bridging between specialized centrosomes and UPS in cardiomyocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bumble bees and honey bees provide crucial pollination service and have become important insect model system. Despite their close relation, they differ in their morphology, physiology, and social organisation. Notably, honey bees workers exhibit age-based polyethism, while bumble bees display considerable body size variation. Though body size is known to affect foraging range, behaviour, and flight ability, the influence of age remains less explored. Here we studied the flight performance (distance and speed) in aging bumble bee workers using tethered flight mills. Additionally, we measured their intertegular distance (ITD), dry mass, and fat content. Flight distance was predominantly influenced by age, challenging assumptions that age does not play a role in foraging and task allocation. Between 7 to 14 days, flight distance increased six-fold before a slight decline at the age of 21 days, aligning with age-dependent flight physiology in honey bees. Larger workers had decreasing mass-specific fat reserves, challenging the notion about their energy preservation for oocyte development. Our findings indicate that age substantially influences flight distance, impacting foraging performance and potentially altering task allocation strategies. This underscores the need to consider individual age and physiological changes alongside body size and mass in experiments involving bumble bee workers.</p>
