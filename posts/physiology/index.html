S.\nScore: 41.6, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.\nPharmacological or genetic inhibition of Scn9a protects beta-cells while reducing insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes\nAuthors: Overby, P.; Provenzano, S.; Nahirney, N. S.; Dai, X.-Q.; Sun, W. G.; Xia, Y.; Kolic, J.; Macdonald, P. E.; Johnson, J. D.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.11.544521\nPancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na+ channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na+ channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na+ channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na+ currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na+ currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose, but not lower concentrations, was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice. These effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the main target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.\nDifferential reaction norms to ocean acidification in two oyster species from contrasting habitats\nAuthors: Caillon, C.; Pernet, F.; Lutier, M.; Di Poi, C.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555611\nOcean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/pCO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we decipher the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species are tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters undergo remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work reveals species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seems to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.\nEstrogen prevents age-dependent beige adipogenesis failure through NAMPT-controlled ER stress pathway\nAuthors: Park, J.; Hu, R.; Xiong, S.; Qian, Y.; El-Sabbagh, A. S.; Ibrahim, M.; Song, Q.; Yan, G.; Song, Z.; Mahmoud, A. M.; He, Y.; Layden, B. T.; Chen, J.; Ong, S.-G.; Xu, P. W.; Jiang, Y.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555821\nThermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process. HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice. C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress. C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the beige adipogenesis derived from SMA+ APCs. C_LIO_LIInhibiting the NAMPT signaling pathway abolishes estrogen-promoted beige adipogenesis.

Y. Y.; Winata, H.; Nian, C.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556709\nAims/hypothesis: Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity. Methods: We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells. Results: Based on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function. Conclusions: Here we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

V.; Lackey, A. E.; Maeoka, Y.; Cornelius, R. J.; McCormick, J. A.; Yang, C.-L.; Jung, H. J.; Welling, P. A.; Nelson, J. W.; Ellison, D. H.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.555810\nBackgroundThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) comprises two subsegments, DCT1 and DCT2, with different functional and molecular characteristics. The functional and molecular distinction between these segments, however, has been controversial. MethodsTo understand the heterogeneity within the DCT population with better clarity, we enriched for DCT nuclei by using a mouse line combining \"Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types\" and NCC (sodium chloride cotransporter)-driven inducible Cre recombinase. We sorted the fluorescently labeled DCT nuclei using Fluorescence-Activated Nucleus Sorting, and performed single nucleus transcriptomics. ResultsAmong 25,183 DCT cells, 70% were from DCT1 and 30% from DCT2. Additionally, there was a small population (\u003c1%) enriched in proliferation-related genes, such asTop2a, Cenpp, and Mki67. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express NCC, magnesium transport genes are more abundant along DCT1; whereas calcium, electrogenic sodium and potassium transport genes are more abundant along DCT2. The transition between these two segments are gradual with a transitional zone where DCT1 and DCT2 cells are interspersed. The expression of the homeobox genes is not consistent between all DCT cells, suggesting that they develop along different trajectories. ConclusionTranscriptomics analysis of an enriched rare cell population using genetically targeted approach offers better clarification of the function and classification. The DCT segment is short, yet, can be separated into two sub-types that serve distinct functions, and are speculated to derive from different origins during development. Significance StatementHigh-resolution snRNAseq data indicate a clear separation between primary sites of calcium and magnesium handling within DCT. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express Slc12a3, but these subsegments serve distinctive functions, with more abundant magnesium handling genes along DCT1 and more calcium handling genes along DCT2. The data also provides insight into the plasticity of the distal nephron-collecting duct junction, formed from cells of separate embryonic origins. By focusing/changing gradients of gene expression, the DCT can morph into different physiological cell states on demand.\nHCN channels sense temperature and determine heart rate responses to heat\nAuthors: Wu, Y.; Wang, Q.; Granger, J.; Reyes Gaido, O. E.; Aguilar, E. N.; Ludwig, A.; Moroni, A.; Bianchet, M. A.; Anderson, M. E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556046\nHeart rate increases with heat, [1-3] constituting a fundamental physiological relationship in vertebrates. Each normal heartbeat is initiated by an action potential generated in a sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cell. Pacemaker cells are enriched with hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCN) that deliver cell membrane depolarizing inward current that triggers action potentials. HCN channel current increases due to cAMP binding, a mechanism coupling adrenergic tone to physiological fight or flight heart rate acceleration. However, the mechanism(s) for heart rate response to thermal energy is unknown. We used thermodynamical and homology computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and mouse models to identify a concise motif on the S4-S5 linker of the cardiac pacemaker HCN4 channels (M407/Y409) that determines HCN4 current (If) and cardiac pacemaker cell responses to heat. This motif is required for heat sensing in cardiac pacemaker cells and in isolated hearts. In contrast, the cyclic nucleotide binding domain is not required for heat induced HCN4 current increases. However, a loss of function M407/Y409 motif mutation prevented normal heat and cAMP responses, suggesting that heat sensing machinery is essential for operating the cAMP allosteric pathway and is central to HCN4 modulation. The M407/Y409 motif is conserved across all HCN family members suggesting that HCN channels participate broadly in coupling heat to changes in cell membrane excitability.\nMyosin-binding protein C forms C-links and stabilizes OFF states of myosin\nAuthors: Hessel, A. L.; Engels, N. M.; Kuehn, M.; Nissen, D.; Sadler, R. L.; Ma, W.; Irving, T. C.; Linke, W. A.; Harris, S. P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.556972\nContraction force in muscle is produced by the interaction of myosin motors in the thick filaments and actin in the thin filaments and is fine tuned by other proteins such as myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). One form of control is through the regulation of myosin heads between an ON and OFF state in passive sarcomeres, which leads to their ability or inability to interact with the thin filaments during contraction, respectively. MyBP-C is a flexible and long protein that is tightly bound to the thick filament at its C-terminal end but may be loosely bound at its middle- and N-terminal end (MyBPC-C1C7). Under considerable debate is whether the MyBP-C C1C7 domains directly regulate myosin head ON/OFF states, and/or link thin filaments (C-links). Here, we used a combination of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the immediate and selective removal of the MyBP-C C1C7 domains of fast MyBP-C in permeabilized skeletal muscle. After cleavage, the thin filaments were significantly shorter, a result consistent with direct interactions of MyBP-C with thin filaments thus confirming C-links. Ca2+ sensitivity was reduced at shorter sarcomere lengths, and crossbridge kinetics were increased across sarcomere lengths at submaximal activation levels, demonstrating a role in crossbridge kinetics. Structural signatures of the thick filaments suggest that cleavage also shifted myosin heads towards the ON state - a marker that typically indicates increased Ca2+ sensitivity but that may account for increased crossbridge kinetics at submaximal Ca2+ and/or a change in the force transmission pathway. Taken together, we conclude that MyBP-C C1C7 domains play an important role in contractile performance which helps explain why mutations in these domains often lead to debilitating diseases.\nOxLDL/LOX-1 Mediated Sex, Age, and Cell Dependent Alterations in Mouse Thoracic Aortic Vascular Reactivity\nAuthors: Wendt, T. S.; Gonzales, R. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556764\nElevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a risk factor and component that worsens cardiovascular disease states. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental action, via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and has been shown to disrupt vascular function. In this study, we determined whether oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments were isolated from intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and incubated with oxLDL ex vivo (50g/dL; 2h). Using wire myography, cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (PE) were generated to determine contractile responses. From these curves, the EC50 was determined and used to contract rings to assess acetylcholine (ACh) dependent relaxation. Calculated aortic stiffness and remodeling, as well as mRNA expression of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed. BI-0115 (10M; selective LOX-1 inhibitor) was used to determine LOX-1 dependence. We observed differential sex, age, endothelial cell, and LOX-1 dependent alterations to the efficacy of PE-induced contractile responses and ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in the thoracic aortic rings following oxLDL exposure. Additionally, we observed a distinct sex and age effect on thoracic aortic stiffness following exposure to oxLDL. There was also a sex effect on calculated vessel diameter, as well as an age effect on oxLDL-mediated inward remodeling that was LOX-1 dependent. Thus, LOX-1 inhibition and the resulting attenuation of oxLDL/endothelial-mediated alterations in aortic function suggests that there are differential sex differences in the role of oxLDL/LOX-1 in the thoracic aorta of male and female mice.\nEffects of a high cholesterol diet on Drosophila chill tolerance are highly context-dependent\nAuthors: Allen, M. C.; Ritchie, M. W.; El-Saadi, M. I.; MacMillan, H. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556984\nChill susceptible insects are thought to be injured through different mechanisms depending on the duration and severity of chilling. While chronic chilling causes \"indirect\" injury through disruption of metabolic and ion homeostasis, acute chilling is suspected to cause \"direct\" injury, in part through phase transitions of cell membrane lipids. Dietary supplementation of cholesterol can reduce acute chilling injury in Drosophila melanogaster, but the generality of this effect and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. To better understand how and why cholesterol has this effect, we assessed how a high cholesterol diet and thermal acclimation independently and interactively impact several measures of chill tolerance in both male and female flies. Cholesterol supplementation positively affected tolerance to acute chilling in warm-acclimated flies (as reported previously). Conversely, feeding on the high-cholesterol diet negatively affected tolerance to chronic chilling in both cold and warm acclimated flies, as well as tolerance to acute chilling in cold acclimated flies. Cholesterol had no effect on the ability of flies to remain active in the cold or recover movement after a cold stress. Our findings support the idea that dietary cholesterol reduces mechanical injury to membranes caused by direct chilling injury, and that acute and chronic chilling are associated with distinct mechanisms of injury. Feeding on a high-cholesterol diet may interfere with mechanisms involved in cold acclimation, leaving cholesterol augmented flies more susceptible to chilling injury under some conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na&#43; channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na&#43; channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na&#43; channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na&#43; currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na&#43; currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose, but not lower concentrations, was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice. These effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the main target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ocean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/pCO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we decipher the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species are tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters undergo remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work reveals species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seems to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process.

HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the beige adipogenesis derived from SMA&#43; APCs.

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesis: Pancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity. Methods: We exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells. Results: Based on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function. Conclusions: Here we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) comprises two subsegments, DCT1 and DCT2, with different functional and molecular characteristics. The functional and molecular distinction between these segments, however, has been controversial.

MethodsTo understand the heterogeneity within the DCT population with better clarity, we enriched for DCT nuclei by using a mouse line combining &#34;Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types&#34; and NCC (sodium chloride cotransporter)-driven inducible Cre recombinase. We sorted the fluorescently labeled DCT nuclei using Fluorescence-Activated Nucleus Sorting, and performed single nucleus transcriptomics.

ResultsAmong 25,183 DCT cells, 70% were from DCT1 and 30% from DCT2. Additionally, there was a small population (&lt;1%) enriched in proliferation-related genes, such asTop2a, Cenpp, and Mki67. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express NCC, magnesium transport genes are more abundant along DCT1; whereas calcium, electrogenic sodium and potassium transport genes are more abundant along DCT2. The transition between these two segments are gradual with a transitional zone where DCT1 and DCT2 cells are interspersed. The expression of the homeobox genes is not consistent between all DCT cells, suggesting that they develop along different trajectories.

ConclusionTranscriptomics analysis of an enriched rare cell population using genetically targeted approach offers better clarification of the function and classification. The DCT segment is short, yet, can be separated into two sub-types that serve distinct functions, and are speculated to derive from different origins during development.

Significance StatementHigh-resolution snRNAseq data indicate a clear separation between primary sites of calcium and magnesium handling within DCT. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express Slc12a3, but these subsegments serve distinctive functions, with more abundant magnesium handling genes along DCT1 and more calcium handling genes along DCT2. The data also provides insight into the plasticity of the distal nephron-collecting duct junction, formed from cells of separate embryonic origins. By focusing/changing gradients of gene expression, the DCT can morph into different physiological cell states on demand.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart rate increases with heat, [1-3] constituting a fundamental physiological relationship in vertebrates. Each normal heartbeat is initiated by an action potential generated in a sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cell. Pacemaker cells are enriched with hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCN) that deliver cell membrane depolarizing inward current that triggers action potentials. HCN channel current increases due to cAMP binding, a mechanism coupling adrenergic tone to physiological  fight or flight heart rate acceleration. However, the mechanism(s) for heart rate response to thermal energy is unknown. We used thermodynamical and homology computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and mouse models to identify a concise motif on the S4-S5 linker of the cardiac pacemaker HCN4 channels (M407/Y409) that determines HCN4 current (If) and cardiac pacemaker cell responses to heat. This motif is required for heat sensing in cardiac pacemaker cells and in isolated hearts. In contrast, the cyclic nucleotide binding domain is not required for heat induced HCN4 current increases. However, a loss of function M407/Y409 motif mutation prevented normal heat and cAMP responses, suggesting that heat sensing machinery is essential for operating the cAMP allosteric pathway and is central to HCN4 modulation. The M407/Y409 motif is conserved across all HCN family members suggesting that HCN channels participate broadly in coupling heat to changes in cell membrane excitability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Contraction force in muscle is produced by the interaction of myosin motors in the thick filaments and actin in the thin filaments and is fine tuned by other proteins such as myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). One form of control is through the regulation of myosin heads between an ON and OFF state in passive sarcomeres, which leads to their ability or inability to interact with the thin filaments during contraction, respectively. MyBP-C is a flexible and long protein that is tightly bound to the thick filament at its C-terminal end but may be loosely bound at its middle- and N-terminal end (MyBPC-C1C7). Under considerable debate is whether the MyBP-C C1C7 domains directly regulate myosin head ON/OFF states, and/or link thin filaments (C-links). Here, we used a combination of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the immediate and selective removal of the MyBP-C C1C7 domains of fast MyBP-C in permeabilized skeletal muscle. After cleavage, the thin filaments were significantly shorter, a result consistent with direct interactions of MyBP-C with thin filaments thus confirming C-links. Ca2&#43; sensitivity was reduced at shorter sarcomere lengths, and crossbridge kinetics were increased across sarcomere lengths at submaximal activation levels, demonstrating a role in crossbridge kinetics. Structural signatures of the thick filaments suggest that cleavage also shifted myosin heads towards the ON state - a marker that typically indicates increased Ca2&#43; sensitivity but that may account for increased crossbridge kinetics at submaximal Ca2&#43; and/or a change in the force transmission pathway. Taken together, we conclude that MyBP-C C1C7 domains play an important role in contractile performance which helps explain why mutations in these domains often lead to debilitating diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Elevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a risk factor and component that worsens cardiovascular disease states. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental action, via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and has been shown to disrupt vascular function. In this study, we determined whether oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments were isolated from intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and incubated with oxLDL ex vivo (50g/dL; 2h). Using wire myography, cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (PE) were generated to determine contractile responses. From these curves, the EC50 was determined and used to contract rings to assess acetylcholine (ACh) dependent relaxation. Calculated aortic stiffness and remodeling, as well as mRNA expression of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed. BI-0115 (10M; selective LOX-1 inhibitor) was used to determine LOX-1 dependence. We observed differential sex, age, endothelial cell, and LOX-1 dependent alterations to the efficacy of PE-induced contractile responses and ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in the thoracic aortic rings following oxLDL exposure. Additionally, we observed a distinct sex and age effect on thoracic aortic stiffness following exposure to oxLDL. There was also a sex effect on calculated vessel diameter, as well as an age effect on oxLDL-mediated inward remodeling that was LOX-1 dependent. Thus, LOX-1 inhibition and the resulting attenuation of oxLDL/endothelial-mediated alterations in aortic function suggests that there are differential sex differences in the role of oxLDL/LOX-1 in the thoracic aorta of male and female mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chill susceptible insects are thought to be injured through different mechanisms depending on the duration and severity of chilling. While chronic chilling causes &#34;indirect&#34; injury through disruption of metabolic and ion homeostasis, acute chilling is suspected to cause &#34;direct&#34; injury, in part through phase transitions of cell membrane lipids. Dietary supplementation of cholesterol can reduce acute chilling injury in Drosophila melanogaster, but the generality of this effect and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. To better understand how and why cholesterol has this effect, we assessed how a high cholesterol diet and thermal acclimation independently and interactively impact several measures of chill tolerance in both male and female flies. Cholesterol supplementation positively affected tolerance to acute chilling in warm-acclimated flies (as reported previously). Conversely, feeding on the high-cholesterol diet negatively affected tolerance to chronic chilling in both cold and warm acclimated flies, as well as tolerance to acute chilling in cold acclimated flies. Cholesterol had no effect on the ability of flies to remain active in the cold or recover movement after a cold stress. Our findings support the idea that dietary cholesterol reduces mechanical injury to membranes caused by direct chilling injury, and that acute and chronic chilling are associated with distinct mechanisms of injury. Feeding on a high-cholesterol diet may interfere with mechanisms involved in cold acclimation, leaving cholesterol augmented flies more susceptible to chilling injury under some conditions.</p>
