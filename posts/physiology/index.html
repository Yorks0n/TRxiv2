J.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.556129\nBones ability to adapt to mechanical loads is attributed the osteocyte. Osteocytes reside embedded in calcified bone matrix, where they function as the resident tissue mechanosensor. Ca2+ signaling is a key second messenger in mechanotransduction in osteocytes. It is used to encode mechanical load magnitude and has been linked to downstream signaling pathways which regulate bone resorbing and bone formation cell activity, however the details regarding Ca2+ signaling regulation in osteocytes in vivo are not well stratified. Osteocytes express components for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known for calcium signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Indeed, cholinergic signaling is known to impact bone mass and fracture risk from studies in both humans and rodents. Despite this convincing evidence of the role of ACh, the details regarding cholinergic signaling in bone mechanotransduction remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine osteocytes as a functional target of cholinergic signaling for bone mechanoadaptation. We generated osteocyte-targeted conditional knockout mice for Chrna1 or Rapsn using the 10kb DMP1 promotor to delete the cholinergic receptor subunit 1 and the channel grouping protein raspyn, respectively. We then performed longitudinal studies to assess skeletal morphology, tissue material make-up, and dynamic responses to anabolic challenge. Our results show sexually dimorphic differences in bone formation rates and bone structure between Cre-negative controls and conditional knockout mice. In females, the reductions to bone geometry were rescued with anabolic loading, but not in males. Our results confirm osteocytes as direct cholinergic targets with an impact on bone mechanoadaptation and suggest a direct link between bone mechanobiology and the central nervous system.\nThe effects of resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged adults\nAuthors: Ruple, B.; Mattingly, M.; Godwin, J.; McIntosh, M.; Kontos, N.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Michel, J. M.; Plotkin, D.; Chen, S.-Y.; Ziegenfuss, T.; Fruge, A.; Gladden, L. B.; Robinson, A.; Mobley, C. B.; Mackey, A. L.; Roberts, M.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560958\nDenervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55{+/-}8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7+), denervated myofibers (NCAM+), senescent cells (p16+ or p21+), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p\u003c0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM+ myofibers, or senescent (p16+ or p21+) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While \u003e90% satellite cells were not p16+ or p21+, most p16+ and p21+ cells were Pax7+ (\u003e90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p\u003c0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p\u003c0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM+ myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.\nTMEM65 regulates NCLX-dependent mitochondrial calcium efflux\nAuthors: Garbincius, J. F.; Salik, O.; Cohen, H. M.; Choya-Foces, C.; Mangold, A. S.; Makhoul, A. D.; Schmidt, A. E.; Khalil, D. Y.; Doolittle, J. J.; Wilkinson, A. S.; Murray, E. K.; Lazaropoulos, M. P.; Hildebrand, A. N.; Tomar, D.; Elrod, J. W.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561062\nThe balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2+ overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2+ efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2+ overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na+)-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2+ efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na+-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2+ overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2+ stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2+ overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2+ homeostasis.\nThe impact of short-lived controls on the interpretation of lifespan experiments and progress in geroscience\nAuthors: Pabis, K. K.; Barardo, D.; Gruber, J.; Sirbu, O.; Selvarajoo, K.; Kaeberlein, M.; Kennedy, B. K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561459\nAlthough lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups. To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this \"900-day rule\" we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.\nSkeletal Muscle Phenotype-Specific Effects of ACVR1B and TGFBR1 Receptor Signalling on Muscle Transcriptome, Force generation and Metabolism\nAuthors: Shi, A.; Hillege, M. M. G.; Noort, W.; Offringa, C.; Wu, G.; Forouzanfar, T.; Hoogaars, W. M. H.; Wust, R. C. I.; Jaspers, R. T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555466\nTransforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signalling is associated with progressive muscle wasting. Targeting TGF-{beta} type I receptors Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 in skeletal muscle results in excessive muscle hypertrophy. However, how myofibre-specific knockout of these receptors affects muscle transcriptome, strength and oxidative metabolisms is unknown. Here, we show that 3 months of myofibre-specific knockout of both receptors (dKO) in fast, low oxidative gastrocnemius medialis muscles induced a 1.6-fold increase in muscle mass while maximal force was increased disproportionally (i.e. specific force was reduced by 23%). In contrast, slow, high oxidative soleus muscle in dKO mice showed only a 1.2-fold increase in muscle mass and maximal force was increased proportionally. Single receptor knockout caused minor phenotypical alterations. Transcriptome analyses showed that gastrocnemius medialis muscles had 1811 and soleus muscles had 295 differentially expressed genes which were mainly related to muscle contraction, hypertrophy, filament organization and oxidative metabolism. Myofibre hypertrophy in both dKO muscles was, strikingly, accompanied by a proportional increase in succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Our results show that myofibre-specific interference with both TGF-{beta} type I receptors concurrently stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and oxidative metabolic capacity.\nAstrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux maintaining brain homeostasis\nAuthors: Pham, C.; Komaki, Y.; Deas-Just, A.; Le Gac, B.; Mouffle, C.; Franco, C.; Vialou, V.; Tsurugizawa, T.; Cauli, B.; Li, D.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560471\nBrain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiber photometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2+ signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma. Significance statementOur brain is immersed, thus protected, in a water environment. It ensures intra- and extracellular molecular diffusion, which is vital for brain function and health. Brain water homeostasis is maintained by dynamic water transport between different cell types. Astrocytes are a main type of glial cell widely distributed in brain parenchyma, and are also the primary cell type expressing the bidirectional aquaporin water channel. Here we show that in basal conditions, aquaporin channel mediates a tonic water efflux from astrocytes. This mechanism maintains astrocyte volume stability, activity-gated brain parenchyma remodeling and brain water homeostasis. Our finding sheds light on how astrocytes regulate water states in the brain, and will help to understand brain homeostasis in specific life context.\nKombucha Tea-associated Microbes Remodel Host Metabolic Pathways to Suppress Lipid Accumulation.\nAuthors: DuMez-Kornegay, R. N.; Morris, A. J.; Dowen, R. H.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560985\nThe popularity of the ancient, probiotic-rich beverage Kombucha Tea (KT) has surged in part due to its purported health benefits, which include protection against metabolic diseases; however, these claims have not been rigorously tested and the mechanisms underlying host response to the probiotics in KT are unknown. Here, we establish a reproducible method to maintain C. elegans on a diet exclusively consisting of Kombucha Tea-associated microbes (KTM), which mirrors the microbial community found in the fermenting culture. KT microbes robustly colonize the gut of KTM-fed animals and confer normal development and fecundity. Intriguingly, animals consuming KTMs display a marked reduction in total lipid stores and lipid droplet size. We find that the reduced fat accumulation phenotype is not due to impaired nutrient absorption, but rather it is sustained by a programed metabolic response in the intestine of the host. KTM consumption triggers widespread transcriptional changes within core lipid metabolism pathways, including upregulation of a suite of lysosomal lipase genes that are induced during lipophagy. The elevated lysosomal lipase activity, coupled with a decrease in lipid droplet biogenesis, is partially required for the reduction in host lipid content. We propose that KTM consumption stimulates a fasting- like response in the C. elegans intestine by rewiring transcriptional programs to promote lipid utilization. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how the probiotics in Kombucha Tea reshape host metabolism and how this popular beverage may impact human metabolism.\nQuantitative Profiling Method for Oxylipins in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry\nAuthors: Pourmand, E.; Zhang, F.; Sarparast, M.; Alan, J. K.; Lee, K. S. S.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560544\nAging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges. In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.

Unfortunately, the lack of a mouse model that develops advanced coronary atherosclerosis and that exhibits a high incidence of spontaneous plaque rupture with MI or stroke has greatly stymied development of more effective therapeutic approaches for reducing these events beyond what has been achieved with aggressive lipid lowering. Herein, we describe a novel mouse model that develops widespread advanced atherosclerosis including in coronary, brachiocephalic, and carotid arteries. These mice show high mortality following Western Diet feeding with clear evidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. To validate the utility of this model, mice were treated with the drug candidate AZM198, which inhibits myeloperoxidase, an enzyme primarily produced by activated neutrophils and predictive of rupture of human atherosclerotic lesions2-7. AZM198 treatment resulted in marked improvements in survival with a greater than 60% decrease in the incidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. In summary, our work describes a novel mouse model that closely replicates late-stage clinical events of advanced human atherosclerotic disease and evidence that this model can be used to identify and test potential new therapeutic agents to prevent major adverse cardiac events.\nDirect measures of liking and intensity of taste, smell, and chemesthetic stimuli are similar between young people reporting they did or did not have COVID-19\nAuthors: Leszkowicz, E.; Bell, K.; Huang, A.; Nguyen, H.; Reed, D. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561170\nThe recovery period from post-COVID-19 smell and taste dysfunctions varies substantially, lasting from a few days to over a year. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on post-COVID-19 chemosensory sensitivity in a group of young convalescents of eastern/central European ancestry. We measured subjects smell and taste capabilities with a standard testing kit, Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ), and collected surveys on COVID-19 history. During testing, subjects rated liking and intensity of six odor samples (galaxolide, guaiacol, beta-ionone, trimethylamine, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl fenchol) and six taste samples (sucralose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthiocarbamide, menthol, capsaicin) on a scale from 1 (dislike extremely, or no intensity) to 9 (like extremely, or extremely intense). There was no statistical difference in intensity ratings or liking of any sample between subjects who reported a history of COVID-19 (n = 34) and those reporting no history (n = 40), independent of presence/absence or severity of smell/taste impairments (P \u003e 0.05). Additionally, neither vaccination status (full vaccination or no vaccination) nor time from the COVID-19 onset (2-27 months) correlated with liking or intensity. These results suggest that most young adults who had COVID-19 recovered their sense of smell and taste.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Bones ability to adapt to mechanical loads is attributed the osteocyte. Osteocytes reside embedded in calcified bone matrix, where they function as the resident tissue mechanosensor. Ca2&#43; signaling is a key second messenger in mechanotransduction in osteocytes. It is used to encode mechanical load magnitude and has been linked to downstream signaling pathways which regulate bone resorbing and bone formation cell activity, however the details regarding Ca2&#43; signaling regulation in osteocytes in vivo are not well stratified. Osteocytes express components for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known for calcium signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Indeed, cholinergic signaling is known to impact bone mass and fracture risk from studies in both humans and rodents. Despite this convincing evidence of the role of ACh, the details regarding cholinergic signaling in bone mechanotransduction remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine osteocytes as a functional target of cholinergic signaling for bone mechanoadaptation. We generated osteocyte-targeted conditional knockout mice for Chrna1 or Rapsn using the 10kb DMP1 promotor to delete the cholinergic receptor subunit 1 and the channel grouping protein raspyn, respectively. We then performed longitudinal studies to assess skeletal morphology, tissue material make-up, and dynamic responses to anabolic challenge. Our results show sexually dimorphic differences in bone formation rates and bone structure between Cre-negative controls and conditional knockout mice. In females, the reductions to bone geometry were rescued with anabolic loading, but not in males. Our results confirm osteocytes as direct cholinergic targets with an impact on bone mechanoadaptation and suggest a direct link between bone mechanobiology and the central nervous system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Denervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55{&#43;/-}8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7&#43;), denervated myofibers (NCAM&#43;), senescent cells (p16&#43; or p21&#43;), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p&lt;0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM&#43; myofibers, or senescent (p16&#43; or p21&#43;) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While &gt;90% satellite cells were not p16&#43; or p21&#43;, most p16&#43; and p21&#43; cells were Pax7&#43; (&gt;90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p&lt;0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p&lt;0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM&#43; myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2&#43;) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2&#43; overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2&#43; efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na&#43;)-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2&#43; efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na&#43;-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2&#43; overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2&#43; stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups. To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this &#34;900-day rule&#34; we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signalling is associated with progressive muscle wasting. Targeting TGF-{beta} type I receptors Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 in skeletal muscle results in excessive muscle hypertrophy. However, how myofibre-specific knockout of these receptors affects muscle transcriptome, strength and oxidative metabolisms is unknown. Here, we show that 3 months of myofibre-specific knockout of both receptors (dKO) in fast, low oxidative gastrocnemius medialis muscles induced a 1.6-fold increase in muscle mass while maximal force was increased disproportionally (i.e. specific force was reduced by 23%). In contrast, slow, high oxidative soleus muscle in dKO mice showed only a 1.2-fold increase in muscle mass and maximal force was increased proportionally. Single receptor knockout caused minor phenotypical alterations. Transcriptome analyses showed that gastrocnemius medialis muscles had 1811 and soleus muscles had 295 differentially expressed genes which were mainly related to muscle contraction, hypertrophy, filament organization and oxidative metabolism. Myofibre hypertrophy in both dKO muscles was, strikingly, accompanied by a proportional increase in succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Our results show that myofibre-specific interference with both TGF-{beta} type I receptors concurrently stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and oxidative metabolic capacity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiber photometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2&#43; signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.

Significance statementOur brain is immersed, thus protected, in a water environment. It ensures intra- and extracellular molecular diffusion, which is vital for brain function and health. Brain water homeostasis is maintained by dynamic water transport between different cell types. Astrocytes are a main type of glial cell widely distributed in brain parenchyma, and are also the primary cell type expressing the bidirectional aquaporin water channel. Here we show that in basal conditions, aquaporin channel mediates a tonic water efflux from astrocytes. This mechanism maintains astrocyte volume stability, activity-gated brain parenchyma remodeling and brain water homeostasis. Our finding sheds light on how astrocytes regulate water states in the brain, and will help to understand brain homeostasis in specific life context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The popularity of the ancient, probiotic-rich beverage Kombucha Tea (KT) has surged in part due to its purported health benefits, which include protection against metabolic diseases; however, these claims have not been rigorously tested and the mechanisms underlying host response to the probiotics in KT are unknown. Here, we establish a reproducible method to maintain C. elegans on a diet exclusively consisting of Kombucha Tea-associated microbes (KTM), which mirrors the microbial community found in the fermenting culture. KT microbes robustly colonize the gut of KTM-fed animals and confer normal development and fecundity. Intriguingly, animals consuming KTMs display a marked reduction in total lipid stores and lipid droplet size. We find that the reduced fat accumulation phenotype is not due to impaired nutrient absorption, but rather it is sustained by a programed metabolic response in the intestine of the host. KTM consumption triggers widespread transcriptional changes within core lipid metabolism pathways, including upregulation of a suite of lysosomal lipase genes that are induced during lipophagy. The elevated lysosomal lipase activity, coupled with a decrease in lipid droplet biogenesis, is partially required for the reduction in host lipid content. We propose that KTM consumption stimulates a fasting- like response in the C. elegans intestine by rewiring transcriptional programs to promote lipid utilization. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how the probiotics in Kombucha Tea reshape host metabolism and how this popular beverage may impact human metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges.

In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.

        <p class="abstract">Thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, caused by the rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques are the leading cause of death worldwide1. Unfortunately, the lack of a mouse model that develops advanced coronary atherosclerosis and that exhibits a high incidence of spontaneous plaque rupture with MI or stroke has greatly stymied development of more effective therapeutic approaches for reducing these events beyond what has been achieved with aggressive lipid lowering. Herein, we describe a novel mouse model that develops widespread advanced atherosclerosis including in coronary, brachiocephalic, and carotid arteries. These mice show high mortality following Western Diet feeding with clear evidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. To validate the utility of this model, mice were treated with the drug candidate AZM198, which inhibits myeloperoxidase, an enzyme primarily produced by activated neutrophils and predictive of rupture of human atherosclerotic lesions2-7. AZM198 treatment resulted in marked improvements in survival with a greater than 60% decrease in the incidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. In summary, our work describes a novel mouse model that closely replicates late-stage clinical events of advanced human atherosclerotic disease and evidence that this model can be used to identify and test potential new therapeutic agents to prevent major adverse cardiac events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recovery period from post-COVID-19 smell and taste dysfunctions varies substantially, lasting from a few days to over a year. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on post-COVID-19 chemosensory sensitivity in a group of young convalescents of eastern/central European ancestry. We measured subjects smell and taste capabilities with a standard testing kit, Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ), and collected surveys on COVID-19 history. During testing, subjects rated liking and intensity of six odor samples (galaxolide, guaiacol, beta-ionone, trimethylamine, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl fenchol) and six taste samples (sucralose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthiocarbamide, menthol, capsaicin) on a scale from 1 (dislike extremely, or no intensity) to 9 (like extremely, or extremely intense). There was no statistical difference in intensity ratings or liking of any sample between subjects who reported a history of COVID-19 (n = 34) and those reporting no history (n = 40), independent of presence/absence or severity of smell/taste impairments (P &gt; 0.05). Additionally, neither vaccination status (full vaccination or no vaccination) nor time from the COVID-19 onset (2-27 months) correlated with liking or intensity. These results suggest that most young adults who had COVID-19 recovered their sense of smell and taste.</p>
