J.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.556129\nBone's ability to adapt to mechanical loads is attributed the osteocyte. Osteocytes reside embedded in calcified bone matrix, where they function as the resident tissue mechanosensor. Ca2+ signaling is a key second messenger in mechanotransduction in osteocytes. It is used to encode mechanical load magnitude and has been linked to downstream signaling pathways which regulate bone resorbing and bone formation cell activity, however the details regarding Ca2+ signaling regulation in osteocytes in vivo are not well stratified. The autonomic arm of the central nervous system uses acetylcholine a peripherally acting neurotransmitter. Osteocytes express components for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the cholinergic receptor subunit 1 and the channel grouping protein raspyn, which are known for Ca2+ signaling and rapid firing at the neuromuscular junction. Indeed, cholinergic signaling is known to impact bone mass and fracture risk from studies in both humans and rodents. Despite this convincing evidence of the role of ACh , the details regarding cholinergic signaling in bone mechanotransduction remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine osteocytes as a functional target of cholinergic signaling for bone mechanoadaptation. We generated osteocyte-targeted conditional knockout mice for Chrna1 or Rapsn using the 10kb DMP1 promotor. We then performed longitudinal studies to assess skeletal morphology, tissue material make-up, and dynamic responses to anabolic challenge. Our results show sexually dimorphic differences in bone formation rates and bone structure between Cre-negative controls and cKO mice. In females, the reductions to bone geometry were rescued with anabolic loading, but not in males. Our results confirm osteocytes as direct cholinergic targets with an impact on bone mechanoadaptation and suggest a direct link between bone mechanobiology and the central nervous system.\nThe effects of resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged adults\nAuthors: Ruple, B.; Mattingly, M.; Godwin, J.; McIntosh, M.; Kontos, N.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Michel, J. M.; Plotkin, D.; Chen, S.-Y.; Ziegenfuss, T.; Fruge, A.; Gladden, L. B.; Robinson, A.; Mobley, C. B.; Mackey, A. L.; Roberts, M.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560958\nDenervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55+/-8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7+), denervated myofibers (NCAM+), senescent cells (p16+ or p21+), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p\u003c0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM+ myofibers, or senescent (p16+ or p21+) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While \u003e90% satellite cells were not p16+ or p21+, most p16+ and p21+ cells were Pax7+ (\u003e90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p\u003c0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p\u003c0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM+ myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.\nLifelong dietary protein restriction accelerates skeletal muscle loss and reduces muscle fibre size by impairing proteostasis and mitochondrial homeostasis\nAuthors: Ersoy, U.; Kanakis, I.; Alameddine, M.; Pedraza Vazquez, G.; E. Ozanne, S.; Peffers, M. J.; Jackson, M. J.; Goljanek-Whysall, K.; Vasilaki, A.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559536\nThe early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.\nSympathetic Motor Neuron Dysfunction is a Missing Link in Age-Associated Sympathetic Overactivity\nAuthors: de la Cruz, L.; Bui, D.; Moreno, C. M.; Vivas, O.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559800\nOveractivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. Additionally, we assessed whether rapamycin, an anti-aging treatment, reverses the age-related changes in sympathetic motor neurons. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of KCNQ channel currents emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. The administration of rapamycin in food for 12 weeks in middle-aged mice partially reverted the KCNQ current reduction and hyperexcitability associated with age. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity. Further, our data suggest that rapamycins beneficial anti-aging effects may be partly attributed to its potential to impact sympathetic nervous system components, providing novel insights into therapeutic strategies for age-related conditions.\nQuantitative Profiling Method for Oxylipins in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry\nAuthors: Pourmand, E.; Zhang, F.; Sarparast, M.; Alan, J. K.; Lee, K. S. S.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560544\nAging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges. In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.

M. G.; Noort, W.; Offringa, C.; Wu, G.; Forouzanfar, T.; Hoogaars, W. M. H.; Wust, R. C. I.; Jaspers, R. T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555466\nTransforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signalling is associated with progressive muscle wasting. Targeting TGF-{beta} type I receptors Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 in skeletal muscle results in excessive muscle hypertrophy. However, how myofibre-specific knockout of these receptors affects muscle transcriptome, strength and oxidative metabolisms is unknown. Here, we show that 3 months of myofibre-specific knockout of both receptors (dKO) in fast, low oxidative gastrocnemius medialis muscles induced a 1.6-fold increase in muscle mass while maximal force was increased disproportionally (i.e. specific force was reduced by 23%). In contrast, slow, high oxidative soleus muscle in dKO mice showed only a 1.2-fold increase in muscle mass and maximal force was increased proportionally. Single receptor knockout caused minor phenotypical alterations. Transcriptome analyses showed that gastrocnemius medialis muscles had 1811 and soleus muscles had 295 differentially expressed genes which were mainly related to muscle contraction, hypertrophy, filament organization and oxidative metabolism. Myofibre hypertrophy in both dKO muscles was, strikingly, accompanied by a proportional increase in succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Our results show that myofibre-specific interference with both TGF-{beta} type I receptors concurrently stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and oxidative metabolic capacity.\nAstrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux maintaining brain homeostasis\nAuthors: Pham, C.; Komaki, Y.; Deas-Just, A.; Le Gac, B.; Mouffle, C.; Franco, C.; Vialou, V.; Tsurugizawa, T.; Cauli, B.; Li, D.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560471\nBrain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiberphotometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2+ signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.\nKombucha Tea-associated Microbes Remodel Host Metabolic Pathways to Suppress Lipid Accumulation.\nAuthors: DuMez-Kornegay, R. N.; Morris, A. J.; Dowen, R. H.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560985\nThe popularity of the ancient, probiotic-rich beverage Kombucha Tea (KT) has surged in part due to its purported health benefits, which include protection against metabolic diseases; however, these claims have not been rigorously tested and the mechanisms underlying host response to the probiotics in KT are unknown. Here, we establish a reproducible method to maintain C. elegans on a diet exclusively consisting of Kombucha Tea-associated microbes (KTM), which mirrors the microbial community found in the fermenting culture. KT microbes robustly colonize the gut of KTM-fed animals and confer normal development and fecundity. Intriguingly, animals consuming KTMs display a marked reduction in total lipid stores and lipid droplet size. We find that the reduced fat accumulation phenotype is not due to impaired nutrient absorption, but rather it is sustained by a programed metabolic response in the intestine of the host. KTM consumption triggers widespread transcriptional changes within core lipid metabolism pathways, including upregulation of a suite of lysosomal lipase genes that are induced during lipophagy. The elevated lysosomal lipase activity, coupled with a decrease in lipid droplet biogenesis, is partially required for the reduction in host lipid content. We propose that KTM consumption stimulates a fasting-like response in the C. elegans intestine by rewiring transcriptional programs to promote lipid utilization. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how the probiotics in Kombucha Tea reshape host metabolism and how this popular beverage may impact human metabolism.\nHuman proton channels accumulate in cholesterol dependent membrane domains via direct interaction with stomatin\nAuthors: Ayuyan, A. G.; Cherny, V. V.; Chaves, G.; Musset, B.; Cohen, F. S.; DeCoursey, T. E.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560017\nMany membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we report strong effects of cholesterol depletion and restoration on the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1 in excised patches but negligible effects in whole-cell configuration. Despite the presence of a putative cholesterol binding site, a CARC domain in the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1, mutation of this domain did not affect cholesterol effects. The murine HV1 lacks a CARC sequence but displays similar cholesterol effects. These three results all argue against a direct effect of cholesterol on HV1. We propose that the data are explainable if HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains, or \"rafts.\" The rafts would be expected to concentrate in the membrane/glass interface and to be depleted from the electrically-accessible patch membrane. This idea is supported by evidence that HV1 channels can diffuse between seal and patch membranes when suction is applied. Suction pulls membrane constituents including HV1 into the patch. In whole-cell studies moderate osmotic stretch does not noticeably alter H+ currents. Simultaneous truncation of the large intracellular N- and C-termini greatly attenuated the cholesterol effect, but C-truncation only did not. We conclude that the N-terminus is the region of attachment to lipid domains. Searching for abundant raft-associated molecules led to stomatin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that hHV1 binds to stomatin. The stomatin-mediated association of HV1 with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains provides a mechanism for cells to direct HV1 to subcellular location where it is needed, such as the phagosome in leukocytes. SignificanceMany membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we explore effects of cholesterol on the human voltage-gated proton channel, hHV1. Although we find little evidence for a direct effect, cholesterol was found to exert a strong influence over H+ current in excised membrane patches. These effects are explainable by hypothesizing that HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent membrane lipid domains. We postulate that HV1 diffuses within the membrane and is concentrated in such domains that are anchored to the pipette glass by large membrane proteins. We find that HV1 co-immunoprecipitates with stomatin, a typical component of cholesterol dependent lipid domains. The association of HV1 with lipid domains provides a mechanism for directing HV1 to specific subcellular locations to perform specific functions.\nTransforming the performance of runners with AI-driven training planning and daily adaptivity\nAuthors: Nilsson, L. C.; Sodergard, O.; Rogestedt, J.; Mattsson, C. M.; Larsen, F. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561160\nBalancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Bone&#39;s ability to adapt to mechanical loads is attributed the osteocyte. Osteocytes reside embedded in calcified bone matrix, where they function as the resident tissue mechanosensor. Ca2&#43; signaling is a key second messenger in mechanotransduction in osteocytes. It is used to encode mechanical load magnitude and has been linked to downstream signaling pathways which regulate bone resorbing and bone formation cell activity, however the details regarding Ca2&#43; signaling regulation in osteocytes in vivo are not well stratified. The autonomic arm of the central nervous system uses acetylcholine a peripherally acting neurotransmitter. Osteocytes express components for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the cholinergic receptor subunit 1 and the channel grouping protein raspyn, which are known for Ca2&#43; signaling and rapid firing at the neuromuscular junction. Indeed, cholinergic signaling is known to impact bone mass and fracture risk from studies in both humans and rodents. Despite this convincing evidence of the role of ACh , the details regarding cholinergic signaling in bone mechanotransduction remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine osteocytes as a functional target of cholinergic signaling for bone mechanoadaptation. We generated osteocyte-targeted conditional knockout mice for Chrna1 or Rapsn using the 10kb DMP1 promotor. We then performed longitudinal studies to assess skeletal morphology, tissue material make-up, and dynamic responses to anabolic challenge. Our results show sexually dimorphic differences in bone formation rates and bone structure between Cre-negative controls and cKO mice. In females, the reductions to bone geometry were rescued with anabolic loading, but not in males. Our results confirm osteocytes as direct cholinergic targets with an impact on bone mechanoadaptation and suggest a direct link between bone mechanobiology and the central nervous system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Denervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55&#43;/-8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7&#43;), denervated myofibers (NCAM&#43;), senescent cells (p16&#43; or p21&#43;), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p&lt;0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM&#43; myofibers, or senescent (p16&#43; or p21&#43;) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While &gt;90% satellite cells were not p16&#43; or p21&#43;, most p16&#43; and p21&#43; cells were Pax7&#43; (&gt;90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p&lt;0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p&lt;0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM&#43; myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. Additionally, we assessed whether rapamycin, an anti-aging treatment, reverses the age-related changes in sympathetic motor neurons. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of KCNQ channel currents emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. The administration of rapamycin in food for 12 weeks in middle-aged mice partially reverted the KCNQ current reduction and hyperexcitability associated with age. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity. Further, our data suggest that rapamycins beneficial anti-aging effects may be partly attributed to its potential to impact sympathetic nervous system components, providing novel insights into therapeutic strategies for age-related conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges.

In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.

        <p class="abstract">Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signalling is associated with progressive muscle wasting. Targeting TGF-{beta} type I receptors Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 in skeletal muscle results in excessive muscle hypertrophy. However, how myofibre-specific knockout of these receptors affects muscle transcriptome, strength and oxidative metabolisms is unknown. Here, we show that 3 months of myofibre-specific knockout of both receptors (dKO) in fast, low oxidative gastrocnemius medialis muscles induced a 1.6-fold increase in muscle mass while maximal force was increased disproportionally (i.e. specific force was reduced by 23%). In contrast, slow, high oxidative soleus muscle in dKO mice showed only a 1.2-fold increase in muscle mass and maximal force was increased proportionally. Single receptor knockout caused minor phenotypical alterations. Transcriptome analyses showed that gastrocnemius medialis muscles had 1811 and soleus muscles had 295 differentially expressed genes which were mainly related to muscle contraction, hypertrophy, filament organization and oxidative metabolism. Myofibre hypertrophy in both dKO muscles was, strikingly, accompanied by a proportional increase in succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Our results show that myofibre-specific interference with both TGF-{beta} type I receptors concurrently stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and oxidative metabolic capacity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiberphotometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2&#43; signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The popularity of the ancient, probiotic-rich beverage Kombucha Tea (KT) has surged in part due to its purported health benefits, which include protection against metabolic diseases; however, these claims have not been rigorously tested and the mechanisms underlying host response to the probiotics in KT are unknown. Here, we establish a reproducible method to maintain C. elegans on a diet exclusively consisting of Kombucha Tea-associated microbes (KTM), which mirrors the microbial community found in the fermenting culture. KT microbes robustly colonize the gut of KTM-fed animals and confer normal development and fecundity. Intriguingly, animals consuming KTMs display a marked reduction in total lipid stores and lipid droplet size. We find that the reduced fat accumulation phenotype is not due to impaired nutrient absorption, but rather it is sustained by a programed metabolic response in the intestine of the host. KTM consumption triggers widespread transcriptional changes within core lipid metabolism pathways, including upregulation of a suite of lysosomal lipase genes that are induced during lipophagy. The elevated lysosomal lipase activity, coupled with a decrease in lipid droplet biogenesis, is partially required for the reduction in host lipid content. We propose that KTM consumption stimulates a fasting-like response in the C. elegans intestine by rewiring transcriptional programs to promote lipid utilization. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how the probiotics in Kombucha Tea reshape host metabolism and how this popular beverage may impact human metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we report strong effects of cholesterol depletion and restoration on the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1 in excised patches but negligible effects in whole-cell configuration. Despite the presence of a putative cholesterol binding site, a CARC domain in the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1, mutation of this domain did not affect cholesterol effects. The murine HV1 lacks a CARC sequence but displays similar cholesterol effects. These three results all argue against a direct effect of cholesterol on HV1. We propose that the data are explainable if HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains, or &#34;rafts.&#34; The rafts would be expected to concentrate in the membrane/glass interface and to be depleted from the electrically-accessible patch membrane. This idea is supported by evidence that HV1 channels can diffuse between seal and patch membranes when suction is applied. Suction pulls membrane constituents including HV1 into the patch. In whole-cell studies moderate osmotic stretch does not noticeably alter H&#43; currents. Simultaneous truncation of the large intracellular N- and C-termini greatly attenuated the cholesterol effect, but C-truncation only did not. We conclude that the N-terminus is the region of attachment to lipid domains. Searching for abundant raft-associated molecules led to stomatin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that hHV1 binds to stomatin. The stomatin-mediated association of HV1 with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains provides a mechanism for cells to direct HV1 to subcellular location where it is needed, such as the phagosome in leukocytes.

SignificanceMany membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we explore effects of cholesterol on the human voltage-gated proton channel, hHV1. Although we find little evidence for a direct effect, cholesterol was found to exert a strong influence over H&#43; current in excised membrane patches. These effects are explainable by hypothesizing that HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent membrane lipid domains. We postulate that HV1 diffuses within the membrane and is concentrated in such domains that are anchored to the pipette glass by large membrane proteins. We find that HV1 co-immunoprecipitates with stomatin, a typical component of cholesterol dependent lipid domains. The association of HV1 with lipid domains provides a mechanism for directing HV1 to specific subcellular locations to perform specific functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Balancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.</p>
