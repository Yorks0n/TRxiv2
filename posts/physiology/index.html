T.; Guillermier, C.; Edassery, S.; Steinhauser, M.; Savas, J. N.; Elizabeth Duncan, F.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562852\nThe mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, but aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated the exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, both ovaries and oocytes harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal components, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules might play a critical role in both lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.\nMuscle Bmal1 is necessary for normal transcriptomic and metabolomic adaptation to endurance exercise training.\nAuthors: Viggars, M. R.; Berko, H. E.; Gutierrez Monreal, M. A.; Martin, R. A.; Esser, K. A.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562100\nObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined. MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units. ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.\nFemale Alms1-deficient mice develop echocardiographic features of adult but not infantile Alström Syndrome cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: McKay, E. J.; Luijten, I.; Thomson, A.; Weng, X.; Gehmlich, K.; Gray, G. A.; Semple, R. K.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562570\nBackgroundAlstrom Syndrome (AS), a multisystem disorder caused by biallelic ALMS1 mutations, features major cardiac complications often causing early mortality. These are biphasic, including infantile dilated cardiomyopathy, and distinct adult-onset cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocyte maturation defects, cardiac fibrosis and early atherosclerosis have all been invoked as contributors to heart failure in AS, but their relative importance and inter-relationships are unknown. MethodsCardiac function of global Alms1 knockout mice was assessed by echocardiography at postnatal day 15 (P15) and at 8 and 23 weeks of age. Echocardiography was also undertaken in female mice with Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 deletion in cardiac fibroblasts and a small proportion of cardiomyocytes. Histological and transcriptional analysis of myocardium at P15 and 24 weeks of age was also performed. ResultsCardiac function was unaltered in knockout mice of both sexes at P15 and 8 weeks of age. At 23 weeks of age female but not male knockout mice showed increased left atrial area, decreased isovolumic relaxation time, and reduced ejection fraction, consistent with early restrictive cardiomyopathy. No histological or transcriptional changes could be identified in myocardium of 23-week old female Alms1 KO mice, however. Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 KO in females did not recapitulate the phenotype of global KO at 23 weeks. ConclusionsAdult female, but not male, Alms1-deficient mice show echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction, consistent with the restrictive cardiomyopathy of AS. The explanation for sexual dimorphism remains unclear, but may involve metabolic or endocrine differences between sexes. No infantile cardiomyopathy was found in this study.\nGAS6 and AXL promote insulin resistance by rewiring insulin signaling and increasing insulin receptor trafficking to late endosomes\nAuthors: Schott, C.; Germain, A.; Lacombe, J.; Faubert, D.; Boulais, J.; Cote, J.-F.; Ferron, M.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563096\nGrowth-arrest specific 6 (GAS6) is a secreted protein that acts as a ligand for TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK). In humans, GAS6 circulating levels and genetic variations in GAS6 are associated with hyperglycemia and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms by which GAS6 influences glucose metabolism are not understood. Here, we show that Gas6 deficiency in mice increases insulin sensitivity and protects from diet-induced insulin resistance. Conversely, increasing GAS6 circulating levels is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity in vivo. Recombinant GAS6 inhibits the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and reduces insulin response in muscle cells. Mechanistically, AXL heterodimerizes with the IR, while GAS6 reprograms signaling pathways downstream of IR. This results in increased trafficking of the IR to Rab7a-positive late endosomes following insulin treatment. Together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which GAS6 and AXL influence insulin sensitivity.\nVertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals during walking.\nAuthors: Li, Y. C.; Bruijn, S. M.; Lemaire, K. K.; Brumagne, S.; van Dieen, J. H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562858\nEvoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p\u003c0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.\nPhysiological Profiles of Male and Female CrossFit Athletes\nAuthors: Hodzic, D.; D'Hulst, G.; Leuenberger, R.; Arnet, J.; Westerhuis, E.; Roth, R.; Schmidt-Trucksass, A.; Knaier, R.; Wagner, J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561828\nObjectiveTo 1) establish extensive physiological profiles of highly-trained CrossFit athletes using gold-standard tests and 2) investigate which physiological markers best correlate with CrossFit(R) Open performance. MethodsThis study encompassed sixty participants (30 males and 30 females), all within the top 5% of the CrossFit(R) Open, including 7 CrossFit(R) Semi-finalists and 3 Games finalists. Isokinetic dynamometers were employed to measure maximum isometric and isokinetic leg and trunk strength. Countermovement jump height and maximum isometric mid-thigh pull strength were assessed on a force plate. V{square}O2peak was measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, while critical power and W were evaluated during a 3-minute all-out test, both on a cycle ergometer. ResultsMale and female athletes median (IQR) V{square}O2peak was 4.64 (4.43, 4.80) and 3.21 (3.10, 3.29) (L{middle dot}min-1), critical power 314.5 (285.9, 343.6) and 221.3 (200.9, 238.9) (W) and mid-thigh pull 3158 (2690, 3462) and 2035 (1728, 2347) (N). Linear regression analysis shows strong evidence for associations between different anthropometric variables and CrossFit(R) Open performance in men and women, whereas for markers of cardiorespiratory fitness such as V{square}O2peak this was only true for women but not men. Conventional laboratory evaluations of strength, however, manifest minimal evidence for associations with Open performance across both sexes. ConclusionsThis study provides the first detailed insights into the physiology of high-performing CrossFit(R) athletes and informs training optimization. Further the results emphasize the advantage of athletes with shorter limbs and suggests potential modifications to Open workout designs to level the playing field for athletes across different anthropometrics characteristics.\nReassessing the role of foot power in human gait\nAuthors: Yetman, Q.; Welte, L.; Shimizu, A.; Rainbow, M. J.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561917\nThe foot acts as the primary interface to the ground during bipedal locomotion. It absorbs and returns energy over stance as the longitudinal arch deforms and recoils. The term arch recoil evokes the concept that the foots returned energy directly propels the centre of mass forward by lifting the talus. However, recent work has shown that arch recoil does not directly drive the body forward; instead, it lowers and posteriorly tilts the talus, putting it into a more favourable position for upright gait. Here, we aim to supply a kinetic explanation for this mechanism. We applied the unified deformable power approach to highly accurate talus kinematics from biplanar videoradiography and force plate measurements to measure the power absorbed/produced by the foot. We coupled these measurements with a simple mathematical model that allowed us to restrict rotation and linear actuation of the talus caused by the recoil of the arch to demonstrate that positive foot power primarily contributes to posteriorly tilting the talus. This suggests the role of positive foot power during propulsion is to keep the talocrural surface in a more favourable position for upright gait rather than directly propelling the centre of mass forwards. These findings highlight that arch mobility during push-off is critical for allowing the ankle to directly propel the body forward and upward during the propulsive phase of gait.\nTMEM65 regulates NCLX-dependent mitochondrial calcium efflux\nAuthors: Garbincius, J. F.; Salik, O.; Cohen, H. M.; Choya-Foces, C.; Mangold, A. S.; Makhoul, A. D.; Schmidt, A. E.; Khalil, D. Y.; Doolittle, J. J.; Wilkinson, A. S.; Murray, E. K.; Lazaropoulos, M. P.; Hildebrand, A. N.; Tomar, D.; Elrod, J. W.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561062\nThe balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2+ overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2+ efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2+ overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na+)-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2+ efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na+-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2+ overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2+ stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2+ overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2+ homeostasis.\nExercise Training and Cold Exposure Trigger Distinct Molecular Adaptations to Inguinal White Adipose Tissue\nAuthors: Vamvini, M.; Nigro, P.; Caputo, T.; Stanford, K. I.; Hirshman, M. F.; Middelbeek, R. J. W.; Goodyear, L. J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562635\nExercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating \u003e2,000 proteins but also boosting iWATs thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.

J.; Cooper, S. T.; Alharbi, H. O.; Chothani, S.; Rackham, O. J.; Meijles, D. N.; Dash, P. R.; Kerkela, R.; Ruparelia, N.; Sugden, P. H.; Clerk, A.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563397\nThe three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN+/- or STRN3+/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN+/- (but not STRN3+/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, but aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated the exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, both ovaries and oocytes harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal components, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules might play a critical role in both lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined.

MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units.

ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlstrom Syndrome (AS), a multisystem disorder caused by biallelic ALMS1 mutations, features major cardiac complications often causing early mortality. These are biphasic, including infantile dilated cardiomyopathy, and distinct adult-onset cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocyte maturation defects, cardiac fibrosis and early atherosclerosis have all been invoked as contributors to heart failure in AS, but their relative importance and inter-relationships are unknown.

MethodsCardiac function of global Alms1 knockout mice was assessed by echocardiography at postnatal day 15 (P15) and at 8 and 23 weeks of age. Echocardiography was also undertaken in female mice with Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 deletion in cardiac fibroblasts and a small proportion of cardiomyocytes. Histological and transcriptional analysis of myocardium at P15 and 24 weeks of age was also performed.

ResultsCardiac function was unaltered in knockout mice of both sexes at P15 and 8 weeks of age. At 23 weeks of age female but not male knockout mice showed increased left atrial area, decreased isovolumic relaxation time, and reduced ejection fraction, consistent with early restrictive cardiomyopathy. No histological or transcriptional changes could be identified in myocardium of 23-week old female Alms1 KO mice, however. Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 KO in females did not recapitulate the phenotype of global KO at 23 weeks.

ConclusionsAdult female, but not male, Alms1-deficient mice show echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction, consistent with the restrictive cardiomyopathy of AS. The explanation for sexual dimorphism remains unclear, but may involve metabolic or endocrine differences between sexes. No infantile cardiomyopathy was found in this study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Growth-arrest specific 6 (GAS6) is a secreted protein that acts as a ligand for TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK). In humans, GAS6 circulating levels and genetic variations in GAS6 are associated with hyperglycemia and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms by which GAS6 influences glucose metabolism are not understood. Here, we show that Gas6 deficiency in mice increases insulin sensitivity and protects from diet-induced insulin resistance. Conversely, increasing GAS6 circulating levels is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity in vivo. Recombinant GAS6 inhibits the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and reduces insulin response in muscle cells. Mechanistically, AXL heterodimerizes with the IR, while GAS6 reprograms signaling pathways downstream of IR. This results in increased trafficking of the IR to Rab7a-positive late endosomes following insulin treatment. Together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which GAS6 and AXL influence insulin sensitivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p&lt;0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo 1) establish extensive physiological profiles of highly-trained CrossFit athletes using gold-standard tests and 2) investigate which physiological markers best correlate with CrossFit(R) Open performance.

MethodsThis study encompassed sixty participants (30 males and 30 females), all within the top 5% of the CrossFit(R) Open, including 7 CrossFit(R) Semi-finalists and 3 Games finalists. Isokinetic dynamometers were employed to measure maximum isometric and isokinetic leg and trunk strength. Countermovement jump height and maximum isometric mid-thigh pull strength were assessed on a force plate. V{square}O2peak was measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, while critical power and W were evaluated during a 3-minute all-out test, both on a cycle ergometer.

ResultsMale and female athletes median (IQR) V{square}O2peak was 4.64 (4.43, 4.80) and 3.21 (3.10, 3.29) (L{middle dot}min-1), critical power 314.5 (285.9, 343.6) and 221.3 (200.9, 238.9) (W) and mid-thigh pull 3158 (2690, 3462) and 2035 (1728, 2347) (N). Linear regression analysis shows strong evidence for associations between different anthropometric variables and CrossFit(R) Open performance in men and women, whereas for markers of cardiorespiratory fitness such as V{square}O2peak this was only true for women but not men. Conventional laboratory evaluations of strength, however, manifest minimal evidence for associations with Open performance across both sexes.

ConclusionsThis study provides the first detailed insights into the physiology of high-performing CrossFit(R) athletes and informs training optimization. Further the results emphasize the advantage of athletes with shorter limbs and suggests potential modifications to Open workout designs to level the playing field for athletes across different anthropometrics characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The foot acts as the primary interface to the ground during bipedal locomotion. It absorbs and returns energy over stance as the longitudinal arch deforms and recoils. The term  arch recoil evokes the concept that the foots returned energy directly propels the centre of mass forward by lifting the talus. However, recent work has shown that arch recoil does not directly drive the body forward; instead, it lowers and posteriorly tilts the talus, putting it into a more favourable position for upright gait. Here, we aim to supply a kinetic explanation for this mechanism. We applied the unified deformable power approach to highly accurate talus kinematics from biplanar videoradiography and force plate measurements to measure the power absorbed/produced by the foot. We coupled these measurements with a simple mathematical model that allowed us to restrict rotation and linear actuation of the talus caused by the recoil of the arch to demonstrate that positive foot power primarily contributes to posteriorly tilting the talus. This suggests the role of positive foot power during propulsion is to keep the talocrural surface in a more favourable position for upright gait rather than directly propelling the centre of mass forwards. These findings highlight that arch mobility during push-off is critical for allowing the ankle to directly propel the body forward and upward during the propulsive phase of gait.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2&#43;) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2&#43; overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2&#43; efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na&#43;)-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2&#43; efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na&#43;-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2&#43; overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2&#43; stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating &gt;2,000 proteins but also boosting iWATs thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.

        <p class="abstract">The three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN&#43;/- or STRN3&#43;/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN&#43;/- (but not STRN3&#43;/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
