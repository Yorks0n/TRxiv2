This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis. Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.\nImpact of Capillary and Sarcolemmal Proximity on Mitochondrial Structure and Energetic Function in Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Parry, H. A.; Willingham, T. B.; Giordano, K. A.; Kim, Y.; Qazi, S.; Knutson, J. R.; Combs, C. A.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574684\nMitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.\nTRPV4 is expressed by enteric glia and muscularis macrophages of the colon but does not play a prominent role in colonic motility\nAuthors: Rajasekhar, P.; Carbone, S. E.; Johnston, S. T.; Nowell, C. J.; Wiklendt, L.; Crampin, E. J.; She, Y.; DiCello, J. J.; Saito, A.; Sorensen, L.; Nguyen, T.; Lee, K. M.; Hamilton, J. A.; King, S. K.; Eriksson, E. M.; Spencer, N. J.; Gulbransen, B. D.; Veldhuis, N. A.; Poole, D. P.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574831\nBackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution. MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2+ imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays. ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2+ signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR+ cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2+ responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2+ signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro. ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility. SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility. C_LIO_LINew analysis methods were developed to examine cellular communication in the enteric glial network. This approach revealed new insights into inflammation-associated changes in glial connectivity. C_LIO_LINew roles for TRPV4 in transduction of distension-evoked responses in the colon and colonic motility were identified. C_LI Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2+ signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility. New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed. C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified. C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling. C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2+ signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation.

S.; Freichels, I. T.; Calubag, M. F.; Rodgers, A. C.; Green, C. L.; Babygirija, R.; Sonsalla, M. M.; Pak, H. H.; Trautman, M.; Hacker, T. A.; Miller, R. A.; Simcox, J.; Lamming, D.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.06.527311\nIn defiance of the paradigm that calories from all sources are equivalent, we and others have shown that dietary protein is a dominant regulator of healthy aging. The restriction of protein or the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine promotes healthspan and extends lifespan when initiated in young or adult mice. However, many interventions are less efficacious or even deleterious when initiated in aged animals. Here, we investigate the physiological, metabolic, and molecular consequences of consuming a diet with a 67% reduction of all amino acids (Low AA), or of isoleucine alone (Low Ile), in male and female C57BL/6J.Nia mice starting at 20 months of age. We find that both diet regimens effectively reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance, which were benefits that were not mediated by reduced calorie intake. Both diets improve specific aspects of frailty, slow multiple molecular indicators of aging rate, and rejuvenate the aging heart and liver at the molecular level. These results demonstrate that Low AA and Low Ile diets can drive youthful physiological and molecular signatures, and support the possibility that these dietary interventions could help to promote healthy aging in older adults.\nEffects of aging on glucose and lipid metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lien, E. C.; Vu, N.; Westermark, A. M.; Danai, L. V.; Lau, A. N.; Gultekin, Y.; Kukurugya, M. A.; Bennett, B. D.; Vander Heiden, M.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572088\nAging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD+, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD+ regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD+-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD+/NADH during healthy aging.\nTime dependent changes in feeding behavior and energy balance associated with weight gain in mice fed obesogenic diets\nAuthors: Fathi, P. A.; Bales, M. B.; Ayala, J. E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575043\nObesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.\nCharacterization of the skeletal muscle arginine methylome in health and disease reveals remodeling in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nAuthors: Wong, J.; Blazev, R.; Ng, Y.-K.; Goodman, C. A.; Montogmery, M. K.; Watt, K. I.; Carl, C. S.; Watt, M. J.; Voldstedlund, C. T.; Richter, E. A.; Crouch, P. J.; Steyn, F. J.; Ngo, S. T.; Parker, B. L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574551\nArginine methylation is a protein post-translational modification important for the development of skeletal muscle mass and function. Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of arginine methylation under settings of health and disease remains largely undefined. Here, we investigated the regulation of arginine methylation in skeletal muscles in response to exercise and hypertrophic growth, and in diseases involving metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We report a limited regulation of arginine methylation under physiological settings that promote muscle health, such as during growth and acute exercise, nor in disease models of insulin resistance. In contrast, we saw a significant remodeling of asymmetric dimethylation in models of atrophy characterized by the loss of innervation, including in muscle biopsies from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome and asymmetric arginine dimethylome of skeletal muscle from individuals with ALS revealed the largest compendium of protein changes with the identification of 793 regulated proteins, and novel site-specific changes in asymmetric dimethyl arginine (aDMA) of key sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins. Finally, we show that in vivo overexpression of PRMT1 and aDMA resulted in increased fatigue resistance and functional recovery in mice. Our study provides evidence for asymmetric dimethylation as a regulator of muscle pathophysiology and presents a valuable proteomics resource and rationale for numerous methylated and non-methylated proteins, including PRMT1, to be pursued for therapeutic development in ALS.\nIntermittent fasting promotes ILC3s secreting IL-22 contributing to the beigeing of white adipose tissue\nAuthors: Chen, H.; Sun, L.; Feng, L.; Han, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhai, W.; Zhang, Z.; Mulholland, M.; Zhang, W.; Yin, Y.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555436\nMechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.\nLoss of STIM1 and STIM2 in salivary glands disrupts ANO1 function but does not induce Sjogren's disease\nAuthors: Son, G.-Y.; Zou, A.; Wahl, A.; Huang, K. T.; Vinu, M.; Zorgit, S.; Zhou, F.; Wagner, L.; Idaghdour, Y.; Yule, D. I.; Feske, S.; Lacruz, R. S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574702\nSjogrens disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth), lymphocytic infiltration into salivary glands and the presence of SSA and SSB autoantibodies. Xerostomia is caused by hypofunction of the salivary glands and has been involved in the development of SjD. Saliva production is regulated by parasympathetic input into the glands initiating intracellular Ca2+ signals that activate the store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway eliciting sustained Ca2+ influx. SOCE is mediated by the STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and the ORAI1 Ca2+ channel. However, there are no studies on the effects of lack of STIM1/2 function in salivary acini in animal models and its impact on SjD. Here we report that male and female mice lacking Stim1 and Stim2 (Stim1/2K14Cre) in salivary glands showed reduced intracellular Ca2+ levels via SOCE in parotid acini and hyposalivate upon pilocarpine stimulation. Bulk RNASeq of the parotid glands of Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed a decrease in the expression of Stim1/2 but no other Ca2+ associated genes mediating saliva fluid secretion. SOCE was however functionally required for the activation of the Ca2+ activated chloride channel ANO1. Despite hyposalivation, ageing Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the glands or elevated levels of SSA or SSB autoantibodies in the serum, which may be linked to the downregulation of the toll-like receptor 8 (Tlr8). By contrast, salivary gland biopsies of SjD patients showed increased STIM1 and TLR8 expression, and induction of SOCE in a salivary gland cell line increased the expression of TLR8. Our data demonstrate that SOCE is an important activator of ANO1 function and saliva fluid secretion in salivary glands. They also provide a novel link between SOCE and TLR8 signaling which may explain why loss of SOCE does not result in SjD.\nHuman Soluble Prorenin Receptor Expressed in Adipose Tissue Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Endothelial Function in Obese Female Mice\nAuthors: Arthur, G.; Ahmed, N.; Nichols, K.; Poupeau, A.; Collins, K.; Lindner, V.; Loria, A. S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575451\nIncreased circulating levels of the soluble prorenin receptor (sPRR), a component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), plays a role in obesity, glucose, and insulin homeostasis. However, elevated plasma sPRR in diabetic patients has been shown correlated with hyperglycemia in women but not men. Hence, the current study sought to understand the contribution of human sPRR (HsPRR) produced in the adipose tissue (Adi) on adipogenesis, and glucose and insulin balance in obesity settings. Adi-HsPRR mice were generated by breeding human sPRR-Myc-tag transgenic mice with mice expressing Adiponectin/Cre. The mouse model was validated by detecting 28kDa myc-tagged HsPRR by western blotting. Adipose HsPRR expression did not change circulating sPRR in female mice fed a standard chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) but increased plasma sPRR in male Adi-HsPRR mice fed a HFD compared to HFD-fed controls. Yet, Adi-HsPRR improved insulin sensitivity, vascular relaxation and the vasodilator agent Ang 1-7 in obese female mice but not in the male counterparts. Moreover, Adi-HsPRR expression reduced the expression of the adipogenic genes SREBP1C and CD36 only in gonadal white adipose from obese female mice, signifying that adipose tissue-derived HsPRR exerts a sex-specific effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function which seems independent of circulating sPRR.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Symbiosis between a host and intracellular eukaryotic microalgae is a widespread life strategy in aquatic ecosystems. This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis.

Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution.

MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2&#43; imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays.

ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2&#43; signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR&#43; cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2&#43; responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2&#43; signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2&#43; release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro.

ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility.

SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility.
C_LIO_LINew analysis methods were developed to examine cellular communication in the enteric glial network. This approach revealed new insights into inflammation-associated changes in glial connectivity.
C_LIO_LINew roles for TRPV4 in transduction of distension-evoked responses in the colon and colonic motility were identified.

Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2&#43; signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility.

New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed.
C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified.
C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling.
C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2&#43; signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation.

        <p class="abstract">In defiance of the paradigm that calories from all sources are equivalent, we and others have shown that dietary protein is a dominant regulator of healthy aging. The restriction of protein or the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine promotes healthspan and extends lifespan when initiated in young or adult mice. However, many interventions are less efficacious or even deleterious when initiated in aged animals. Here, we investigate the physiological, metabolic, and molecular consequences of consuming a diet with a 67% reduction of all amino acids (Low AA), or of isoleucine alone (Low Ile), in male and female C57BL/6J.Nia mice starting at 20 months of age. We find that both diet regimens effectively reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance, which were benefits that were not mediated by reduced calorie intake. Both diets improve specific aspects of frailty, slow multiple molecular indicators of aging rate, and rejuvenate the aging heart and liver at the molecular level. These results demonstrate that Low AA and Low Ile diets can drive youthful physiological and molecular signatures, and support the possibility that these dietary interventions could help to promote healthy aging in older adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD&#43;, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD&#43;, NADH, and the NAD&#43;/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD&#43; from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD&#43; regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD&#43;-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD&#43;/NADH during healthy aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arginine methylation is a protein post-translational modification important for the development of skeletal muscle mass and function. Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of arginine methylation under settings of health and disease remains largely undefined. Here, we investigated the regulation of arginine methylation in skeletal muscles in response to exercise and hypertrophic growth, and in diseases involving metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We report a limited regulation of arginine methylation under physiological settings that promote muscle health, such as during growth and acute exercise, nor in disease models of insulin resistance. In contrast, we saw a significant remodeling of asymmetric dimethylation in models of atrophy characterized by the loss of innervation, including in muscle biopsies from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome and asymmetric arginine dimethylome of skeletal muscle from individuals with ALS revealed the largest compendium of protein changes with the identification of 793 regulated proteins, and novel site-specific changes in asymmetric dimethyl arginine (aDMA) of key sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins. Finally, we show that in vivo overexpression of PRMT1 and aDMA resulted in increased fatigue resistance and functional recovery in mice. Our study provides evidence for asymmetric dimethylation as a regulator of muscle pathophysiology and presents a valuable proteomics resource and rationale for numerous methylated and non-methylated proteins, including PRMT1, to be pursued for therapeutic development in ALS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sjogrens disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth), lymphocytic infiltration into salivary glands and the presence of SSA and SSB autoantibodies. Xerostomia is caused by hypofunction of the salivary glands and has been involved in the development of SjD. Saliva production is regulated by parasympathetic input into the glands initiating intracellular Ca2&#43; signals that activate the store operated Ca2&#43; entry (SOCE) pathway eliciting sustained Ca2&#43; influx. SOCE is mediated by the STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and the ORAI1 Ca2&#43; channel. However, there are no studies on the effects of lack of STIM1/2 function in salivary acini in animal models and its impact on SjD. Here we report that male and female mice lacking Stim1 and Stim2 (Stim1/2K14Cre) in salivary glands showed reduced intracellular Ca2&#43; levels via SOCE in parotid acini and hyposalivate upon pilocarpine stimulation. Bulk RNASeq of the parotid glands of Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed a decrease in the expression of Stim1/2 but no other Ca2&#43; associated genes mediating saliva fluid secretion. SOCE was however functionally required for the activation of the Ca2&#43; activated chloride channel ANO1. Despite hyposalivation, ageing Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the glands or elevated levels of SSA or SSB autoantibodies in the serum, which may be linked to the downregulation of the toll-like receptor 8 (Tlr8). By contrast, salivary gland biopsies of SjD patients showed increased STIM1 and TLR8 expression, and induction of SOCE in a salivary gland cell line increased the expression of TLR8. Our data demonstrate that SOCE is an important activator of ANO1 function and saliva fluid secretion in salivary glands. They also provide a novel link between SOCE and TLR8 signaling which may explain why loss of SOCE does not result in SjD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increased circulating levels of the soluble prorenin receptor (sPRR), a component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), plays a role in obesity, glucose, and insulin homeostasis. However, elevated plasma sPRR in diabetic patients has been shown correlated with hyperglycemia in women but not men. Hence, the current study sought to understand the contribution of human sPRR (HsPRR) produced in the adipose tissue (Adi) on adipogenesis, and glucose and insulin balance in obesity settings. Adi-HsPRR mice were generated by breeding human sPRR-Myc-tag transgenic mice with mice expressing Adiponectin/Cre. The mouse model was validated by detecting 28kDa myc-tagged HsPRR by western blotting. Adipose HsPRR expression did not change circulating sPRR in female mice fed a standard chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) but increased plasma sPRR in male Adi-HsPRR mice fed a HFD compared to HFD-fed controls. Yet, Adi-HsPRR improved insulin sensitivity, vascular relaxation and the vasodilator agent Ang 1-7 in obese female mice but not in the male counterparts. Moreover, Adi-HsPRR expression reduced the expression of the adipogenic genes SREBP1C and CD36 only in gonadal white adipose from obese female mice, signifying that adipose tissue-derived HsPRR exerts a sex-specific effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function which seems independent of circulating sPRR.</p>
