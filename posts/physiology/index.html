A.; Heckman, C.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563670\nMotoneurons are the final common pathway for all motor commands and possess intrinsic electrical properties that must be tuned to control muscle across the full range of motor behaviors. Neuromodulatory input from the brainstem is likely essential for adapting motoneuron properties to match this diversity of motor tasks. A primary mechanism of this adaptation, control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs) in motoneurons by brainstem monoaminergic systems, generates both amplification and prolongation of synaptic inputs. While essential, there is an inherent tension between this amplification and prolongation. Although amplification by PICs allows for quick recruitment and acceleration of motoneuron discharge during discrete motor tasks, PICs must be deactivated to de-recruit motoneurons upon movement cessation. In contrast, during stabilizing or postural tasks, PIC-induced prolongation of synaptic inputs is likely critical for sustained motoneuron discharge. Here, we designed two motor tasks that show PIC amplification and prolongation may conflict and generate errors that degrade the precision of motor output in humans. This included a paradigm comprised of a discrete motor task superimposed atop a stabilizing task and a paradigm with muscle length-induced changes to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs available for controlling PICs. We show that prolongation from PICs introduces deficits in ankle torque control and that these deficits are further degraded at shorter muscle lengths when PIC prolongation is greatest. These results highlight the necessity for inhibitory control of PICs and showcase issues that are introduced when inhibitory control is perturbed or constrained. Our findings suggest that, like sensory systems, errors are inherent in motor systems. These errors are not due to problems in the perception of movement-related sensory input but are embedded in the final stage of motor output.\nVertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals during walking.\nAuthors: Li, Y. C.; Bruijn, S. M.; Lemaire, K. K.; Brumagne, S.; van Dieen, J. H.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562858\nEvoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p\u003c0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.\nGAS6 and AXL promote insulin resistance by rewiring insulin signaling and increasing insulin receptor trafficking to late endosomes\nAuthors: Schott, C.; Germain, A.; Lacombe, J.; Faubert, D.; Boulais, J.; Cote, J.-F.; Ferron, M.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563096\nGrowth-arrest specific 6 (GAS6) is a secreted protein that acts as a ligand for TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK). In humans, GAS6 circulating levels and genetic variations in GAS6 are associated with hyperglycemia and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms by which GAS6 influences glucose metabolism are not understood. Here, we show that Gas6 deficiency in mice increases insulin sensitivity and protects from diet-induced insulin resistance. Conversely, increasing GAS6 circulating levels is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity in vivo. Recombinant GAS6 inhibits the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and reduces insulin response in muscle cells. Mechanistically, AXL heterodimerizes with the IR, while GAS6 reprograms signaling pathways downstream of IR. This results in increased trafficking of the IR to Rab7a-positive late endosomes following insulin treatment. Together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which GAS6 and AXL influence insulin sensitivity. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSO_LIGAS6 deficient mice are characterized by improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitivity and are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance. C_LIO_LIThe GAS6 receptor AXL is expressed in muscle cells and physically interacts with the insulin receptor. C_LIO_LIGAS6 reprograms insulin signaling by modulating the phosphorylation of proteins implicated in endocytosis, vesicle-mediated transport, and membrane trafficking.

MethodsThis study encompassed sixty participants (30 males and 30 females), all within the top 5% of the CrossFit(R) Open, including 7 CrossFit(R) Semi-finalists and 3 Games finalists. Isokinetic dynamometers were employed to measure maximum isometric and isokinetic leg and trunk strength. Countermovement jump height and maximum isometric mid-thigh pull strength were assessed on a force plate. V{square}O2peak was measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, while critical power and W were evaluated during a 3-minute all-out test, both on a cycle ergometer. ResultsMale and female athletes median (IQR) V{square}O2peak was 4.64 (4.43, 4.80) and 3.21 (3.10, 3.29) (L{middle dot}min-1), critical power 314.5 (285.9, 343.6) and 221.3 (200.9, 238.9) (W) and mid-thigh pull 3158 (2690, 3462) and 2035 (1728, 2347) (N). Linear regression analysis shows strong evidence for associations between different anthropometric variables and CrossFit(R) Open performance in men and women, whereas for markers of cardiorespiratory fitness such as V{square}O2peak this was only true for women but not men. Conventional laboratory evaluations of strength, however, manifest minimal evidence for associations with Open performance across both sexes. ConclusionsThis study provides the first detailed insights into the physiology of high-performing CrossFit(R) athletes and informs training optimization. Further the results emphasize the advantage of athletes with shorter limbs and suggests potential modifications to Open workout designs to level the playing field for athletes across different anthropometrics characteristics.\nLactate Dynamics in Skin Interstitial Fluid Predicts Lactate Threshold in Exercising Rats\nAuthors: Dobashi, S.; Funabashi, D.; Sameshima, K.; Tsuruoka, N.; Matsui, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563585\nThe blood lactate threshold (LT) is a crucial marker of metabolic shifts and stress transitions during exercise, influencing optimal intensity determination and chronic exercise impact evaluation across diverse individuals. Although recent studies have explored methods for estimating blood lactate levels without blood sampling, accurate solutions for LT estimation remain undeveloped. Here, we tested the analytical capability of an ultra-minimally invasive technique for LT measurement that harnesses skin interstitial lactate dynamics using a single microneedle perfusion system. The rats were acclimated to exercise and underwent external jugular vein cannulation. Following comprehensive recovery, a 1 mm single microneedle was implanted into the back skin. This allowed for the simultaneous measurement of lactate concentrations in the blood and skin interstitial fluid during incremental treadmill exercise. Skin lactate progressively increased in tandem with blood lactate during incremental exercise, albeit with lingering post-exercise clearance that did not correlate with blood lactate. Remarkably, LT extrapolated from skin lactate showed significant alignment with blood LT. Our findings reveal the potential of skin interstitial dynamics to accurately assess LT during exercise using a single microneedle, integrating the discoveries of exercise physiology into real-world athletic and/or healthy practices.

F.; Salik, O.; Cohen, H. M.; Choya-Foces, C.; Mangold, A. S.; Makhoul, A. D.; Schmidt, A. E.; Khalil, D. Y.; Doolittle, J. J.; Wilkinson, A. S.; Murray, E. K.; Lazaropoulos, M. P.; Hildebrand, A. N.; Tomar, D.; Elrod, J. W.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561062\nThe balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2+ overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2+ efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2+ overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na+)-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2+ efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na+-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2+ overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2+ stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2+ overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2+ homeostasis.\nForce sensing GPR133 is essential for normal balance and modulates vestibular hair cell membrane excitability via Gi signaling and CNGA3 coupling\nAuthors: yang, z.; zhou, s.; wang, m.; ping, y.; fu, x.; zhao, r.; xiao, p.; lu, y.; zhang, q.; song, z.; xi, y.; lin, h.; zheng, y.; qin, w.; yi, f.; Yu, X.; chai, r.; Sun, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563882\nThe maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.\nUnlocking the Role of sMyBP-C: A Key Player in Skeletal Muscle Development and Growth\nAuthors: Song, T.; McNamara, J.; Baby, A.; Ma, W.; Landim-Vieira, M.; Natesan, S.; Pinto, J. R.; Lorenz, J. N.; Irving, T.; Sadayappan, S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563591\nSkeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body, responsible for gross movement and metabolic regulation. Recently, variants in the MYBPC1 gene have been implicated in a variety of developmental muscle diseases, such as distal arthrogryposis. How MYBPC1 variants cause disease is not well understood. Here, through a collection of novel gene-edited mouse models, we define a critical role for slow myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), encoded by MYBPC1, across muscle development, growth, and maintenance during prenatal, perinatal, postnatal and adult stages. Specifically, Mybpc1 knockout mice exhibited early postnatal lethality and impaired skeletal muscle formation and structure, skeletal deformity, and respiratory failure. Moreover, a conditional knockout of Mybpc1 in perinatal, postnatal and adult stages demonstrates impaired postnatal muscle growth and function secondary to disrupted actomyosin interaction and sarcomere structural integrity. These findings confirm the essential role of sMyBP-C in skeletal muscle and reveal specific functions in both prenatal embryonic musculoskeletal development and postnatal muscle growth and function.\nMuscle Bmal1 is necessary for normal transcriptomic and metabolomic adaptation to endurance exercise training.\nAuthors: Viggars, M. R.; Berko, H. E.; Gutierrez Monreal, M. A.; Martin, R. A.; Esser, K. A.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562100\nObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined. MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units. ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.\nStriatin plays a major role in angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte and cardiac hypertrophy in mice in vivo.\nAuthors: Cull, J. J.; Cooper, S. T.; Alharbi, H. O.; Chothani, S.; Rackham, O. J.; Meijles, D. N.; Dash, P. R.; Kerkela, R.; Ruparelia, N.; Sugden, P. H.; Clerk, A.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563397\nThe three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN+/- or STRN3+/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN+/- (but not STRN3+/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Clinical perspectivesO_LIBackground. Striatins form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase And Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes that regulate crucial cellular processes such as those associated with heart failure. C_LIO_LISummary. The three striatins are expressed in human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts, whilst studies in mice indicate that STRN is required in cardiomyocytes for early remodelling of the hypertensive heart. C_LIO_LIPotential significance of results to human health and disease. STRN-based STRIPAKs represent a novel signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and modulating this system may provide therapeutic options for managing the cardiac effects of hypertensive heart disease.

        <p class="abstract">Motoneurons are the final common pathway for all motor commands and possess intrinsic electrical properties that must be tuned to control muscle across the full range of motor behaviors. Neuromodulatory input from the brainstem is likely essential for adapting motoneuron properties to match this diversity of motor tasks. A primary mechanism of this adaptation, control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs) in motoneurons by brainstem monoaminergic systems, generates both amplification and prolongation of synaptic inputs. While essential, there is an inherent tension between this amplification and prolongation. Although amplification by PICs allows for quick recruitment and acceleration of motoneuron discharge during discrete motor tasks, PICs must be deactivated to de-recruit motoneurons upon movement cessation. In contrast, during stabilizing or postural tasks, PIC-induced prolongation of synaptic inputs is likely critical for sustained motoneuron discharge. Here, we designed two motor tasks that show PIC amplification and prolongation may conflict and generate errors that degrade the precision of motor output in humans. This included a paradigm comprised of a discrete motor task superimposed atop a stabilizing task and a paradigm with muscle length-induced changes to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs available for controlling PICs. We show that prolongation from PICs introduces deficits in ankle torque control and that these deficits are further degraded at shorter muscle lengths when PIC prolongation is greatest. These results highlight the necessity for inhibitory control of PICs and showcase issues that are introduced when inhibitory control is perturbed or constrained. Our findings suggest that, like sensory systems, errors are inherent in motor systems. These errors are not due to problems in the perception of movement-related sensory input but are embedded in the final stage of motor output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p&lt;0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Growth-arrest specific 6 (GAS6) is a secreted protein that acts as a ligand for TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK). In humans, GAS6 circulating levels and genetic variations in GAS6 are associated with hyperglycemia and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms by which GAS6 influences glucose metabolism are not understood. Here, we show that Gas6 deficiency in mice increases insulin sensitivity and protects from diet-induced insulin resistance. Conversely, increasing GAS6 circulating levels is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity in vivo. Recombinant GAS6 inhibits the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and reduces insulin response in muscle cells. Mechanistically, AXL heterodimerizes with the IR, while GAS6 reprograms signaling pathways downstream of IR. This results in increased trafficking of the IR to Rab7a-positive late endosomes following insulin treatment. Together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which GAS6 and AXL influence insulin sensitivity.

ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSO_LIGAS6 deficient mice are characterized by improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitivity and are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo 1) establish extensive physiological profiles of highly-trained CrossFit athletes using gold-standard tests and 2) investigate which physiological markers best correlate with CrossFit(R) Open performance.

MethodsThis study encompassed sixty participants (30 males and 30 females), all within the top 5% of the CrossFit(R) Open, including 7 CrossFit(R) Semi-finalists and 3 Games finalists. Isokinetic dynamometers were employed to measure maximum isometric and isokinetic leg and trunk strength. Countermovement jump height and maximum isometric mid-thigh pull strength were assessed on a force plate. V{square}O2peak was measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, while critical power and W were evaluated during a 3-minute all-out test, both on a cycle ergometer.

ResultsMale and female athletes median (IQR) V{square}O2peak was 4.64 (4.43, 4.80) and 3.21 (3.10, 3.29) (L{middle dot}min-1), critical power 314.5 (285.9, 343.6) and 221.3 (200.9, 238.9) (W) and mid-thigh pull 3158 (2690, 3462) and 2035 (1728, 2347) (N). Linear regression analysis shows strong evidence for associations between different anthropometric variables and CrossFit(R) Open performance in men and women, whereas for markers of cardiorespiratory fitness such as V{square}O2peak this was only true for women but not men. Conventional laboratory evaluations of strength, however, manifest minimal evidence for associations with Open performance across both sexes.

ConclusionsThis study provides the first detailed insights into the physiology of high-performing CrossFit(R) athletes and informs training optimization. Further the results emphasize the advantage of athletes with shorter limbs and suggests potential modifications to Open workout designs to level the playing field for athletes across different anthropometrics characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The blood lactate threshold (LT) is a crucial marker of metabolic shifts and stress transitions during exercise, influencing optimal intensity determination and chronic exercise impact evaluation across diverse individuals. Although recent studies have explored methods for estimating blood lactate levels without blood sampling, accurate solutions for LT estimation remain undeveloped. Here, we tested the analytical capability of an ultra-minimally invasive technique for LT measurement that harnesses skin interstitial lactate dynamics using a single microneedle perfusion system. The rats were acclimated to exercise and underwent external jugular vein cannulation. Following comprehensive recovery, a 1 mm single microneedle was implanted into the back skin. This allowed for the simultaneous measurement of lactate concentrations in the blood and skin interstitial fluid during incremental treadmill exercise. Skin lactate progressively increased in tandem with blood lactate during incremental exercise, albeit with lingering post-exercise clearance that did not correlate with blood lactate. Remarkably, LT extrapolated from skin lactate showed significant alignment with blood LT. Our findings reveal the potential of skin interstitial dynamics to accurately assess LT during exercise using a single microneedle, integrating the discoveries of exercise physiology into real-world athletic and/or healthy practices.

        <p class="abstract">The balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2&#43;) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2&#43; overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2&#43; efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na&#43;)-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2&#43; efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na&#43;-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2&#43; overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2&#43; stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body, responsible for gross movement and metabolic regulation. Recently, variants in the MYBPC1 gene have been implicated in a variety of developmental muscle diseases, such as distal arthrogryposis. How MYBPC1 variants cause disease is not well understood. Here, through a collection of novel gene-edited mouse models, we define a critical role for slow myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), encoded by MYBPC1, across muscle development, growth, and maintenance during prenatal, perinatal, postnatal and adult stages. Specifically, Mybpc1 knockout mice exhibited early postnatal lethality and impaired skeletal muscle formation and structure, skeletal deformity, and respiratory failure. Moreover, a conditional knockout of Mybpc1 in perinatal, postnatal and adult stages demonstrates impaired postnatal muscle growth and function secondary to disrupted actomyosin interaction and sarcomere structural integrity. These findings confirm the essential role of sMyBP-C in skeletal muscle and reveal specific functions in both prenatal embryonic musculoskeletal development and postnatal muscle growth and function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined.

MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units.

ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN&#43;/- or STRN3&#43;/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN&#43;/- (but not STRN3&#43;/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Clinical perspectivesO_LIBackground. Striatins form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase And Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes that regulate crucial cellular processes such as those associated with heart failure.
C_LIO_LISummary. The three striatins are expressed in human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts, whilst studies in mice indicate that STRN is required in cardiomyocytes for early remodelling of the hypertensive heart.
C_LIO_LIPotential significance of results to human health and disease. STRN-based STRIPAKs represent a novel signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and modulating this system may provide therapeutic options for managing the cardiac effects of hypertensive heart disease.
