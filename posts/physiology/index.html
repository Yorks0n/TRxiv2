C.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.574247\nRationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity. MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons. ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates. ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.\nTime dependent changes in feeding behavior and energy balance associated with weight gain in mice fed obesogenic diets\nAuthors: Fathi, P. A.; Bales, M. B.; Ayala, J. E.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575043\nObesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.\nMetformin protects the heart against chronic intermittent hypoxia through AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1α\nAuthors: Moulin, S.; Blachot-Minassian, B.; Kneppers, A.; Thomas, A.; Paradis, S.; Bultot, L.; Arnaud, C.; Pepin, J.-L.; Bertrand, L.; Mounier, R.; Belaidi, E.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575152\nChronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1+/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.\nIdentification of novel and distinct FGF23 signaling in a Klotho-dependent and -independent manner\nAuthors: Kopper, K.; Pastor, J.; Moe, O. W.; Loffing, J.; Pathare, G.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576116\nFibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is crucial for phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Moreover, FGF23 levels are very high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with unclear functions. Binding of FGF23 to its coreceptor Klotho is considered essential for its actions. However, recent data suggested that CKD-related high FGF23 levels may have Klotho-independent cardiotoxic and inflammatory effects but the underlying signaling mechanism are unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased transcriptomic profiling in HEK293 cells, comparing the effects of 0.5 nM FGF23 for 1 hour (low-transitory: ~physiological) and 10 nM FGF23 for 24 hours (high-prolonged: ~pathological), in the presence and absence of Klotho. We found that, at physiological concentration, FGF23 action requires Klotho and follows the canonical MAPK signaling. Conversely, at pathological high levels, FGF23 acts both in the presence and in the absence of Klotho. In the presence of Klotho, high FGF23 activates a plethora of transcripts including the inflammatory genes (e.g. TGFB1, GDF15, ANXA1 and TNFRSF9/12) known to be elevated in patients with CKD. Interestingly, in the absence of Klotho, high FGF23 levels does also regulate a small and unique set of genes related to post-transcriptional modifications and translation initiation. To conclude, Klotho is essential for FGF23 signaling at physiological FGF23 concentrations. However, with pathologically high FGF23 levels, Klotho acts as a molecular switch determining the type of FGF23 response.\nDietary methionine/choline deficiency affects behavioural and molecular circadian rhythms\nAuthors: Saer, B.; Taylor, G.; Hayes, A.; Ananthasubramaniam, B.; Fustin, J.-M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574014\nThe feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders. Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis. We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.\nCell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of arginase-II on cardiac aging\nAuthors: Potenza, D. M.; Cheng, X.; AJALBERT, G.; Brenna, A.; Giraud, M.-N.; FROBERT, A.; Cook, S.; Mertz, K. D.; Yang, Z.; Ming, X.-F.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576017\nAging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of arg-ii (arg-ii-/-) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1beta release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1b from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.\nTRPV4 is expressed by enteric glia and muscularis macrophages of the colon but does not play a prominent role in colonic motility\nAuthors: Rajasekhar, P.; Carbone, S. E.; Johnston, S. T.; Nowell, C. J.; Wiklendt, L.; Crampin, E. J.; She, Y.; DiCello, J. J.; Saito, A.; Sorensen, L.; Nguyen, T.; Lee, K. M.; Hamilton, J. A.; King, S. K.; Eriksson, E. M.; Spencer, N. J.; Gulbransen, B. D.; Veldhuis, N. A.; Poole, D. P.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574831\nBackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution. MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2+ imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays. ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2+ signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR+ cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2+ responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2+ signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro. ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility. SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility. C_LIO_LINew analysis methods were developed to examine cellular communication in the enteric glial network. This approach revealed new insights into inflammation-associated changes in glial connectivity. C_LIO_LINew roles for TRPV4 in transduction of distension-evoked responses in the colon and colonic motility were identified. C_LI Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2+ signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility. New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed. C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified. C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling. C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2+ signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation. C_LI\nImpact of Capillary and Sarcolemmal Proximity on Mitochondrial Structure and Energetic Function in Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Parry, H. A.; Willingham, T. B.; Giordano, K. A.; Kim, Y.; Qazi, S.; Knutson, J. R.; Combs, C. A.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574684\nMitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.\nFish Blood Response to Ash-Induced Environmental Alkalinization, and their Implications to Wildfire-Scarred Watersheds\nAuthors: Kwan, G. T.; Sanders, T.; Huang, S.; Kilaghbian, K.; Sam, C.; Wang, J.; Weihrauch, K.; Wilson, R. W.; Fangue, N. A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574400\nChanges in land use, warming climate and increased drought have amplified wildfire frequency and magnitude globally. Ash mixing into aquatic systems after wildfires rapidly increases water pH, creating an additional threat to wildlife, especially species that are already threatened, endangered and/or migratory. Here, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) yearlings acclimated to 15 or 20{degrees}C were exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of ash (0.25% w/v) which caused water pH to rapidly rise from [~]8.1 to [~]9.2. Mortalities occurred within the first 12 hours, and was higher at the higher temperature (33 versus 20 %). The greatest differences in blood chemistry between the two temperatures were dramatically greater ([~]7.5-fold) and very rapid (within 1 hour) spikes in both plasma total ammonia (to [~]1200 {micro}M) and lactate (to [~]6 mM) in warm-acclimated salmon, whereas cold-acclimated salmon experienced a much smaller and gradual rise in plasma total ammonia. Salmon at both temperatures experienced extracellular and intracellular alkalosis within 1 hour that recovered within 24 hours, but the alkalosis was smaller in magnitude in fish at warmer temperature. Impacts on plasma ion concentrations were relatively mild and plasma glucose increased by 2- to 4-fold at both temperatures. Notably, the increase in plasma total ammonia in fish at the warmer temperature was far faster and much greater than those reported in previous studies exposing fish despite higher water pH (9.4-10.5) induced without using ash. This suggests that ash has physiological impacts that cannot be explained by high water pH alone which may relate to the complex mixture of metals and organic compounds also released from ash. This demonstrates post-wildfire ash input can induce lethal yet previously unexplored physiological disturbances in fish and highlights the complex interaction with warmer temperatures typical of wildfire-scarred landscapes.\nBone quality following peripubertal growth in a mouse model of transmasculine gender-affirming hormone therapy\nAuthors: Henry, B. W.; Dela Cruz, C.; Goulet, R. W.; Nolan, B. T.; Locke, C.; Padmanabhan, V.; Moravec, M. B.; Shikanov, A.; Killian, M. L.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570840\nDuring peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender and gender diverse youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender and gender diverse youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa + T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender and gender diverse youth.\n",

        <p class="abstract">RationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity.

MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons.

ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates.

ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1&#43;/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is crucial for phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Moreover, FGF23 levels are very high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with unclear functions. Binding of FGF23 to its coreceptor Klotho is considered essential for its actions. However, recent data suggested that CKD-related high FGF23 levels may have Klotho-independent cardiotoxic and inflammatory effects but the underlying signaling mechanism are unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased transcriptomic profiling in HEK293 cells, comparing the effects of 0.5 nM FGF23 for 1 hour (low-transitory: ~physiological) and 10 nM FGF23 for 24 hours (high-prolonged: ~pathological), in the presence and absence of Klotho. We found that, at physiological concentration, FGF23 action requires Klotho and follows the canonical MAPK signaling. Conversely, at pathological high levels, FGF23 acts both in the presence and in the absence of Klotho. In the presence of Klotho, high FGF23 activates a plethora of transcripts including the inflammatory genes (e.g. TGFB1, GDF15, ANXA1 and TNFRSF9/12) known to be elevated in patients with CKD. Interestingly, in the absence of Klotho, high FGF23 levels does also regulate a small and unique set of genes related to post-transcriptional modifications and translation initiation. To conclude, Klotho is essential for FGF23 signaling at physiological FGF23 concentrations. However, with pathologically high FGF23 levels, Klotho acts as a molecular switch determining the type of FGF23 response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders.

Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis.

We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of arg-ii (arg-ii-/-) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1beta release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1b from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution.

MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2&#43; imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays.

ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2&#43; signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR&#43; cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2&#43; responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2&#43; signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2&#43; release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro.

ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility.

SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility.
C_LIO_LINew analysis methods were developed to examine cellular communication in the enteric glial network. This approach revealed new insights into inflammation-associated changes in glial connectivity.

Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2&#43; signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility.

New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed.
C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified.
C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling.
C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2&#43; signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation.

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Changes in land use, warming climate and increased drought have amplified wildfire frequency and magnitude globally. Ash mixing into aquatic systems after wildfires rapidly increases water pH, creating an additional threat to wildlife, especially species that are already threatened, endangered and/or migratory. Here, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) yearlings acclimated to 15 or 20{degrees}C were exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of ash (0.25% w/v) which caused water pH to rapidly rise from [~]8.1 to [~]9.2. Mortalities occurred within the first 12 hours, and was higher at the higher temperature (33 versus 20 %). The greatest differences in blood chemistry between the two temperatures were dramatically greater ([~]7.5-fold) and very rapid (within 1 hour) spikes in both plasma total ammonia (to [~]1200 {micro}M) and lactate (to [~]6 mM) in warm-acclimated salmon, whereas cold-acclimated salmon experienced a much smaller and gradual rise in plasma total ammonia. Salmon at both temperatures experienced extracellular and intracellular alkalosis within 1 hour that recovered within 24 hours, but the alkalosis was smaller in magnitude in fish at warmer temperature. Impacts on plasma ion concentrations were relatively mild and plasma glucose increased by 2- to 4-fold at both temperatures. Notably, the increase in plasma total ammonia in fish at the warmer temperature was far faster and much greater than those reported in previous studies exposing fish despite higher water pH (9.4-10.5) induced without using ash. This suggests that ash has physiological impacts that cannot be explained by high water pH alone which may relate to the complex mixture of metals and organic compounds also released from ash. This demonstrates post-wildfire ash input can induce lethal yet previously unexplored physiological disturbances in fish and highlights the complex interaction with warmer temperatures typical of wildfire-scarred landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender and gender diverse youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender and gender diverse youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa &#43; T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender and gender diverse youth.</p>
