A.; Heckman, C.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563670\nMotoneurons are the final common pathway for all motor commands and possess intrinsic electrical properties that must be tuned to control muscle across the full range of motor behaviors. Neuromodulatory input from the brainstem is likely essential for adapting motoneuron properties to match this diversity of motor tasks. A primary mechanism of this adaptation, control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs) in motoneurons by brainstem monoaminergic systems, generates both amplification and prolongation of synaptic inputs. While essential, there is an inherent tension between this amplification and prolongation. Although amplification by PICs allows for quick recruitment and acceleration of motoneuron discharge during discrete motor tasks, PICs must be deactivated to de-recruit motoneurons upon movement cessation. In contrast, during stabilizing or postural tasks, PIC-induced prolongation of synaptic inputs is likely critical for sustained motoneuron discharge. Here, we designed two motor tasks that show PIC amplification and prolongation may conflict and generate errors that degrade the precision of motor output in humans. This included a paradigm comprised of a discrete motor task superimposed atop a stabilizing task and a paradigm with muscle length-induced changes to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs available for controlling PICs. We show that prolongation from PICs introduces deficits in ankle torque control and that these deficits are further degraded at shorter muscle lengths when PIC prolongation is greatest. These results highlight the necessity for inhibitory control of PICs and showcase issues that are introduced when inhibitory control is perturbed or constrained. Our findings suggest that, like sensory systems, errors are inherent in motor systems. These errors are not due to problems in the perception of movement-related sensory input but are embedded in the final stage of motor output.\nLactate Dynamics in Skin Interstitial Fluid Predicts Lactate Threshold in Exercising Rats\nAuthors: Dobashi, S.; Funabashi, D.; Sameshima, K.; Tsuruoka, N.; Matsui, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563585\nThe blood lactate threshold (LT) is a crucial marker of metabolic shifts and stress transitions during exercise, influencing optimal intensity determination and chronic exercise impact evaluation across diverse individuals. Although recent studies have explored methods for estimating blood lactate levels without blood sampling, accurate solutions for LT estimation remain undeveloped. Here, we tested the analytical capability of an ultra-minimally invasive technique for LT measurement that harnesses skin interstitial lactate dynamics using a single microneedle perfusion system. The rats were acclimated to exercise and underwent external jugular vein cannulation. Following comprehensive recovery, a 1 mm single microneedle was implanted into the back skin. This allowed for the simultaneous measurement of lactate concentrations in the blood and skin interstitial fluid during incremental treadmill exercise. Skin lactate progressively increased in tandem with blood lactate during incremental exercise, albeit with lingering post-exercise clearance that did not correlate with blood lactate. Remarkably, LT extrapolated from skin lactate showed significant alignment with blood LT. Our findings reveal the potential of skin interstitial dynamics to accurately assess LT during exercise using a single microneedle, integrating the discoveries of exercise physiology into real-world athletic and/or healthy practices.

M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562613\nObjectiveChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of global illness and death, most commonly caused by cigarette smoke. The mechanisms of pathogenesis remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective therapies. The gastrointestinal microbiome has been implicated in chronic lung diseases via the gut-lung axis, but its role is unclear. DesignUsing an in vivo mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD and fecal microbial transfer (FMT), we characterized the fecal microbiota using metagenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Findings were correlated with airway and systemic inflammation, lung and gut histopathology, and lung function. Complex carbohydrates were assessed in mice using a high resistant starch diet, and in sixteen COPD patients using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of inulin supplementation. ResultsFMT alleviated hallmark features of COPD (inflammation, alveolar destruction, impaired lung function), gastrointestinal pathology and systemic immune changes. Protective effects were additive to smoking cessation. Disease features correlated with the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Lachnospiraceae family members. Proteomics and metabolomics identified downregulation of glucose and starch metabolism in cigarette smoke-associated microbiota, and supplementation of mice or human patients with complex carbohydrates improved disease outcomes.

I.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564159\nAge-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies. In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies. Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.\nForce sensing GPR133 is essential for normal balance and modulates vestibular hair cell membrane excitability via Gi signaling and CNGA3 coupling\nAuthors: yang, z.; zhou, s.; wang, m.; ping, y.; fu, x.; zhao, r.; xiao, p.; lu, y.; zhang, q.; song, z.; xi, y.; lin, h.; zheng, y.; qin, w.; yi, f.; Yu, X.; chai, r.; Sun, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563882\nThe maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.\nUnlocking the Role of sMyBP-C: A Key Player in Skeletal Muscle Development and Growth\nAuthors: Song, T.; McNamara, J.; Baby, A.; Ma, W.; Landim-Vieira, M.; Natesan, S.; Pinto, J. R.; Lorenz, J. N.; Irving, T.; Sadayappan, S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563591\nSkeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body, responsible for gross movement and metabolic regulation. Recently, variants in the MYBPC1 gene have been implicated in a variety of developmental muscle diseases, such as distal arthrogryposis. How MYBPC1 variants cause disease is not well understood. Here, through a collection of novel gene-edited mouse models, we define a critical role for slow myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), encoded by MYBPC1, across muscle development, growth, and maintenance during prenatal, perinatal, postnatal and adult stages. Specifically, Mybpc1 knockout mice exhibited early postnatal lethality and impaired skeletal muscle formation and structure, skeletal deformity, and respiratory failure. Moreover, a conditional knockout of Mybpc1 in perinatal, postnatal and adult stages demonstrates impaired postnatal muscle growth and function secondary to disrupted actomyosin interaction and sarcomere structural integrity. These findings confirm the essential role of sMyBP-C in skeletal muscle and reveal specific functions in both prenatal embryonic musculoskeletal development and postnatal muscle growth and function.\nVertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals during walking.\nAuthors: Li, Y. C.; Bruijn, S. M.; Lemaire, K. K.; Brumagne, S.; van Dieen, J. H.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562858\nEvoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p\u003c0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.\nStriatin plays a major role in angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte and cardiac hypertrophy in mice in vivo.\nAuthors: Cull, J. J.; Cooper, S. T.; Alharbi, H. O.; Chothani, S.; Rackham, O. J.; Meijles, D. N.; Dash, P. R.; Kerkela, R.; Ruparelia, N.; Sugden, P. H.; Clerk, A.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.563397\nThe three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN+/- or STRN3+/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN+/- (but not STRN3+/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Clinical perspectivesO_LIBackground.

STRN-based STRIPAKs represent a novel signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and modulating this system may provide therapeutic options for managing the cardiac effects of hypertensive heart disease.

W.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563851\nThe mechanisms for the loss in limb muscle power in old (60-79 years) and very old (\u003e80 years) adults and whether the mechanisms differ between men and women are not well-understood. We compared maximal power of the knee extensor muscles between young, old, and very old men and women and identified the neural and muscular factors contributing to the age-related loss of power. 31 young (22.9+/-3.0 years, 15 women), 83 old (70.4+/-4.9 years, 39 women), and 16 very old adults (85.8+/-4.2 years, 9 women) performed maximal isokinetic contractions at 14 different velocities (30-450deg/s) to identify peak power. Voluntary activation (VA) and contractile properties were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve. The age-related loss in power was ~6.5 W/year for men (R2=0.62, p\u003c0.001), which was a greater rate of decline (p=0.002) than the ~4.2 W/year for women (R2=0.77, p\u003c0.001). Contractile properties were the most closely associated variables with power output for both sexes, such as the rate of torque development of the potentiated twitch (men: R2=0.69, p\u003c0.001; women: R2=0.57, p\u003c0.001). VA was weakly associated with power in women (R2=0.13, p=0.012) but not men (p=0.191), whereas neuromuscular activation (EMG amplitude) during the maximal power contraction was not associated with power in men (p=0.347) or women (p=0.106). These data suggest that the age-related loss in power of the knee extensor muscles is due primarily to factors within the muscle for both sexes, although neural factors may play a minor role in older women.\nExercise Training and Cold Exposure Trigger Distinct Molecular Adaptations to Inguinal White Adipose Tissue\nAuthors: Vamvini, M.; Nigro, P.; Caputo, T.; Stanford, K. I.; Hirshman, M. F.; Middelbeek, R. J. W.; Goodyear, L. J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562635\nExercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating \u003e2,000 proteins but also boosting iWATs thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.

        <p class="abstract">Motoneurons are the final common pathway for all motor commands and possess intrinsic electrical properties that must be tuned to control muscle across the full range of motor behaviors. Neuromodulatory input from the brainstem is likely essential for adapting motoneuron properties to match this diversity of motor tasks. A primary mechanism of this adaptation, control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs) in motoneurons by brainstem monoaminergic systems, generates both amplification and prolongation of synaptic inputs. While essential, there is an inherent tension between this amplification and prolongation. Although amplification by PICs allows for quick recruitment and acceleration of motoneuron discharge during discrete motor tasks, PICs must be deactivated to de-recruit motoneurons upon movement cessation. In contrast, during stabilizing or postural tasks, PIC-induced prolongation of synaptic inputs is likely critical for sustained motoneuron discharge. Here, we designed two motor tasks that show PIC amplification and prolongation may conflict and generate errors that degrade the precision of motor output in humans. This included a paradigm comprised of a discrete motor task superimposed atop a stabilizing task and a paradigm with muscle length-induced changes to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs available for controlling PICs. We show that prolongation from PICs introduces deficits in ankle torque control and that these deficits are further degraded at shorter muscle lengths when PIC prolongation is greatest. These results highlight the necessity for inhibitory control of PICs and showcase issues that are introduced when inhibitory control is perturbed or constrained. Our findings suggest that, like sensory systems, errors are inherent in motor systems. These errors are not due to problems in the perception of movement-related sensory input but are embedded in the final stage of motor output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The blood lactate threshold (LT) is a crucial marker of metabolic shifts and stress transitions during exercise, influencing optimal intensity determination and chronic exercise impact evaluation across diverse individuals. Although recent studies have explored methods for estimating blood lactate levels without blood sampling, accurate solutions for LT estimation remain undeveloped. Here, we tested the analytical capability of an ultra-minimally invasive technique for LT measurement that harnesses skin interstitial lactate dynamics using a single microneedle perfusion system. The rats were acclimated to exercise and underwent external jugular vein cannulation. Following comprehensive recovery, a 1 mm single microneedle was implanted into the back skin. This allowed for the simultaneous measurement of lactate concentrations in the blood and skin interstitial fluid during incremental treadmill exercise. Skin lactate progressively increased in tandem with blood lactate during incremental exercise, albeit with lingering post-exercise clearance that did not correlate with blood lactate. Remarkably, LT extrapolated from skin lactate showed significant alignment with blood LT. Our findings reveal the potential of skin interstitial dynamics to accurately assess LT during exercise using a single microneedle, integrating the discoveries of exercise physiology into real-world athletic and/or healthy practices.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of global illness and death, most commonly caused by cigarette smoke. The mechanisms of pathogenesis remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective therapies. The gastrointestinal microbiome has been implicated in chronic lung diseases via the gut-lung axis, but its role is unclear.

DesignUsing an in vivo mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD and fecal microbial transfer (FMT), we characterized the fecal microbiota using metagenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Findings were correlated with airway and systemic inflammation, lung and gut histopathology, and lung function. Complex carbohydrates were assessed in mice using a high resistant starch diet, and in sixteen COPD patients using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of inulin supplementation.

ResultsFMT alleviated hallmark features of COPD (inflammation, alveolar destruction, impaired lung function), gastrointestinal pathology and systemic immune changes. Protective effects were additive to smoking cessation. Disease features correlated with the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Lachnospiraceae family members. Proteomics and metabolomics identified downregulation of glucose and starch metabolism in cigarette smoke-associated microbiota, and supplementation of mice or human patients with complex carbohydrates improved disease outcomes.

ConclusionThe gut microbiome contributes to COPD pathogenesis and can be targeted therapeutically.

        <p class="abstract">Age-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies. In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies. Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body, responsible for gross movement and metabolic regulation. Recently, variants in the MYBPC1 gene have been implicated in a variety of developmental muscle diseases, such as distal arthrogryposis. How MYBPC1 variants cause disease is not well understood. Here, through a collection of novel gene-edited mouse models, we define a critical role for slow myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), encoded by MYBPC1, across muscle development, growth, and maintenance during prenatal, perinatal, postnatal and adult stages. Specifically, Mybpc1 knockout mice exhibited early postnatal lethality and impaired skeletal muscle formation and structure, skeletal deformity, and respiratory failure. Moreover, a conditional knockout of Mybpc1 in perinatal, postnatal and adult stages demonstrates impaired postnatal muscle growth and function secondary to disrupted actomyosin interaction and sarcomere structural integrity. These findings confirm the essential role of sMyBP-C in skeletal muscle and reveal specific functions in both prenatal embryonic musculoskeletal development and postnatal muscle growth and function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 minutes at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (p&lt;0.01) was found at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e., a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated response along the trunk during walking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The three striatins (STRN, STRN3, STRN4) form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase and Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. These place protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in proximity to protein kinases thereby restraining kinase activity and regulating key cellular processes. Our aim was to establish if striatins play a significant role in cardiac remodelling associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. All striatins were expressed in control human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts. We used mice with global heterozygote gene deletion to assess the roles of STRN and STRN3 in cardiac remodelling induced by angiotensin II (AngII; 7 days). Using echocardiography, we detected no differences in baseline cardiac function or dimensions in STRN&#43;/- or STRN3&#43;/- male mice (8 weeks) compared with wild-type littermates. Heterozygous gene deletion did not affect cardiac function in mice treated with AngII, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited in STRN&#43;/- (but not STRN3&#43;/-) mice. Histological staining indicated that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was inhibited. To assess the role of STRN in cardiomyocytes, we converted the STRN knockout line for inducible cardiomyocyte-specific gene deletion. There was no effect of cardiomyocyte STRN knockout on cardiac function or dimensions, but the increase in left ventricle mass induced by AngII was inhibited. This resulted from inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The data indicate that cardiomyocyte striatin is required for early remodelling of the heart by AngII and identify the striatin-based STRIPAK system as a signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Clinical perspectivesO_LIBackground. Striatins form the core of STRiatin-Interacting Phosphatase And Kinase (STRIPAK) complexes that regulate crucial cellular processes such as those associated with heart failure.
C_LIO_LISummary. The three striatins are expressed in human hearts, with upregulation of STRN and STRN3 in failing hearts, whilst studies in mice indicate that STRN is required in cardiomyocytes for early remodelling of the hypertensive heart.
C_LIO_LIPotential significance of results to human health and disease. STRN-based STRIPAKs represent a novel signalling paradigm in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and modulating this system may provide therapeutic options for managing the cardiac effects of hypertensive heart disease.

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms for the loss in limb muscle power in old (60-79 years) and very old (&gt;80 years) adults and whether the mechanisms differ between men and women are not well-understood. We compared maximal power of the knee extensor muscles between young, old, and very old men and women and identified the neural and muscular factors contributing to the age-related loss of power. 31 young (22.9&#43;/-3.0 years, 15 women), 83 old (70.4&#43;/-4.9 years, 39 women), and 16 very old adults (85.8&#43;/-4.2 years, 9 women) performed maximal isokinetic contractions at 14 different velocities (30-450deg/s) to identify peak power. Voluntary activation (VA) and contractile properties were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motor cortex and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve. The age-related loss in power was ~6.5 W/year for men (R2=0.62, p&lt;0.001), which was a greater rate of decline (p=0.002) than the ~4.2 W/year for women (R2=0.77, p&lt;0.001). Contractile properties were the most closely associated variables with power output for both sexes, such as the rate of torque development of the potentiated twitch (men: R2=0.69, p&lt;0.001; women: R2=0.57, p&lt;0.001). VA was weakly associated with power in women (R2=0.13, p=0.012) but not men (p=0.191), whereas neuromuscular activation (EMG amplitude) during the maximal power contraction was not associated with power in men (p=0.347) or women (p=0.106). These data suggest that the age-related loss in power of the knee extensor muscles is due primarily to factors within the muscle for both sexes, although neural factors may play a minor role in older women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating &gt;2,000 proteins but also boosting iWATs thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.
