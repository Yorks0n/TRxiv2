S.\nScore: 48.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.

S.; Dai, X.-Q.; Sun, W. G.; Xia, Y.; Kolic, J.; Macdonald, P. E.; Johnson, J. D.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.11.544521\nPancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na+ channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na+ channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na+ channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na+ currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na+ currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose, but not lower concentrations, was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice. These effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the main target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.\nCalcium-dependent transcriptional profiles of human pancreatic islet cells reveal functional diversity in islet subpopulations\nAuthors: Yoon, J. S.; Sasaki, S.; Velghe, J.; Zosel, K.; Lee, M. Y. Y.; Winata, H.; Nian, C.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556709\nAims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity. MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells. ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function. ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

M.; Kuehn, M.; Nissen, D.; Sadler, R. L.; Ma, W.; Irving, T. C.; Linke, W. A.; Harris, S. P.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.556972\nContraction force in muscle is produced by the interaction of myosin motors in the thick filaments and actin in the thin filaments and is fine-tuned by other proteins such as myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). One form of control is through the regulation of myosin heads between an ON and OFF state in passive sarcomeres, which leads to their ability or inability to interact with the thin filaments during contraction, respectively. MyBP-C is a flexible and long protein that is tightly bound to the thick filament at its C-terminal end but may be loosely bound at its middle- and N-terminal end (MyBP-CC1C7). Under considerable debate is whether the MyBP-CC1C7 domains directly regulate myosin head ON/OFF states, and/or link thin filaments (\"C-links\"). Here, we used a combination of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the immediate and selective removal of the MyBP-CC1C7 domains of fast MyBP-C in permeabilized skeletal muscle. After cleavage, the thin filaments were significantly shorter, a result consistent with direct interactions of MyBP-C with thin filaments thus confirming C-links. Ca2+ sensitivity was reduced at shorter sarcomere lengths, and crossbridge kinetics were increased across sarcomere lengths at submaximal activation levels, demonstrating a role in crossbridge kinetics. Structural signatures of the thick filaments suggest that cleavage also shifted myosin heads towards the ON state - a marker that typically indicates increased Ca2+ sensitivity but that may account for increased crossbridge kinetics at submaximal Ca2+ and/or a change in the force transmission pathway. Taken together, we conclude that MyBP-CC1C7 domains play an important role in contractile performance which helps explain why mutations in these domains often lead to debilitating diseases.\nEstrogen prevents age-dependent beige adipogenesis failure through NAMPT-controlled ER stress pathway\nAuthors: Park, J.; Hu, R.; Xiong, S.; Qian, Y.; El-Sabbagh, A.

W.; Jiang, Y.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555821\nThermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process. HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice. C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress.

W.; Ghooraroo, J.; Hockley, J. R.; Rahman, T.; Smith, E. S. J.; Brown, A. J.; Suzuki, R.; Bulmer, D. C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557415\nThe development of non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain is a pressing area of unmet clinical need. To address this, we examined the expression of Gi/o-coupled receptors in colonic sensory neurons, which, like opioid receptors, have the potential to inhibit nociceptor activation due to their inhibitory G protein coupling. This led to the identification of the orphan receptor GPR35 as a visceral analgesic drug target due to its marked co-expression with TRPA1, a mediator of noxious mechanotransduction in the bowel. Consistent with in silico docking studies which identified binding sites for the mast cell stabiliser cromolyn and phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast at GPR35, we demonstrated using GPR35 knockout mice that the antinociceptive effects of these drugs on TRPA1-mediated colonic nociceptor activation and mechanosensitisation were GPR35-dependent. Further work showed these antinociceptive effects occurred through the inhibition of substance P (SP) release. This confirmed both the pronociceptive effect of SP on colonic afferents, and the contribution of SP to TRPA1-mediated colonic nociceptor activation and sensitisation. We also found that TRPA1-induced contraction of the colon was mediated by SP signalling and could be inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. Our data identify GPR35, through its inhibition of SP-mediated colonic contractility and nociceptor activation and sensitisation, as a putative mechanism for the reported clinical efficacy of cromolyn in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. These findings highlight the potential utility of GPR35 agonists to deliver non-opioid analgesia for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.\nHCN channels sense temperature and determine heart rate responses to heat\nAuthors: Wu, Y.; Wang, Q.; Granger, J.; Reyes Gaido, O. E.; Aguilar, E. N.; Ludwig, A.; Moroni, A.; Bianchet, M. A.; Anderson, M. E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556046\nHeart rate increases with heat, [1-3] constituting a fundamental physiological relationship in vertebrates. Each normal heartbeat is initiated by an action potential generated in a sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cell. Pacemaker cells are enriched with hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCN) that deliver cell membrane depolarizing inward current that triggers action potentials. HCN channel current increases due to cAMP binding, a mechanism coupling adrenergic tone to physiological fight or flight heart rate acceleration. However, the mechanism(s) for heart rate response to thermal energy is unknown. We used thermodynamical and homology computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and mouse models to identify a concise motif on the S4-S5 linker of the cardiac pacemaker HCN4 channels (M407/Y409) that determines HCN4 current (If) and cardiac pacemaker cell responses to heat. This motif is required for heat sensing in cardiac pacemaker cells and in isolated hearts. In contrast, the cyclic nucleotide binding domain is not required for heat induced HCN4 current increases. However, a loss of function M407/Y409 motif mutation prevented normal heat and cAMP responses, suggesting that heat sensing machinery is essential for operating the cAMP allosteric pathway and is central to HCN4 modulation. The M407/Y409 motif is conserved across all HCN family members suggesting that HCN channels participate broadly in coupling heat to changes in cell membrane excitability.\nOxLDL/LOX-1 Mediated Sex, Age, and Cell Dependent Alterations in Mouse Thoracic Aortic Vascular Reactivity\nAuthors: Wendt, T. S.; Gonzales, R. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556764\nElevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a risk factor and component that worsens cardiovascular disease states. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental action, via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and has been shown to disrupt vascular function. In this study, we determined whether oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments were isolated from intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and incubated with oxLDL ex vivo (50ug/dL; 2h). Using wire myography, cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (PE) were generated to determine contractile responses. From these curves, the EC50 was determined and used to contract rings to assess acetylcholine (ACh) dependent relaxation. Calculated aortic stiffness and remodeling, as well as mRNA expression of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed. BI-0115 (10M; selective LOX-1 inhibitor) was used to determine LOX-1 dependence. We observed differential sex, age, endothelial cell, and LOX-1 dependent alterations to the efficacy of PE-induced contractile responses and ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in the thoracic aortic rings following oxLDL exposure. Additionally, we observed a distinct sex and age effect on thoracic aortic stiffness following exposure to oxLDL. There was also a sex effect on calculated vessel diameter, as well as an age effect on oxLDL-mediated inward remodeling that was LOX-1 dependent. Thus, LOX-1 inhibition and the resulting attenuation of oxLDL/endothelial-mediated alterations in aortic function suggests that there are differential sex differences in the role of oxLDL/LOX-1 in the thoracic aorta of male and female mice. NEW \u0026 NOTEWORTHYWe investigated the effects of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) via the LOX-1 receptor on murine thoracic aortic vasoreactivity, stiffness, and remodeling across age and sex. Acute exposure to oxLDL led to altered vasoreactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in aortic stiffness and remodeling. These effects were in-part age, sex, endothelial, and LOX-1 dependent. This study reveals potential complex interactions in oxLDL/LOX-1-mediated vascular responses that could serve as potential therapeutic intervention for vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

C.; Ritchie, M. W.; El-Saadi, M. I.; MacMillan, H. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556984\nChill susceptible insects are thought to be injured through different mechanisms depending on the duration and severity of chilling. While chronic chilling causes \"indirect\" injury through disruption of metabolic and ion homeostasis, acute chilling is suspected to cause \"direct\" injury, in part through phase transitions of cell membrane lipids. Dietary supplementation of cholesterol can reduce acute chilling injury in Drosophila melanogaster, but the generality of this effect and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. To better understand how and why cholesterol has this effect, we assessed how a high cholesterol diet and thermal acclimation independently and interactively impact several measures of chill tolerance in both male and female flies. Cholesterol supplementation positively affected tolerance to acute chilling in warm-acclimated flies (as reported previously). Conversely, feeding on the high-cholesterol diet negatively affected tolerance to chronic chilling in both cold and warm acclimated flies, as well as tolerance to acute chilling in cold acclimated flies. Cholesterol had no effect on the ability of flies to remain active in the cold or recover movement after a cold stress. Our findings support the idea that dietary cholesterol reduces mechanical injury to membranes caused by direct chilling injury, and that acute and chronic chilling are associated with distinct mechanisms of injury. Feeding on a high-cholesterol diet may interfere with mechanisms involved in cold acclimation, leaving cholesterol augmented flies more susceptible to chilling injury under some conditions. HighlightsO_LICholesterol improves cold shock tolerance of warm-acclimated flies C_LIO_LICold acclimation and chronic cold instead lead to negative effects of cholesterol on chill tolerance C_LIO_LICholesterol did not affect the ability of flies to remain active in the cold C_LIO_LIBoth sexes were similarly affected by a high cholesterol diet C_LI\nLoss of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1a Reduces Docosahexaenoic Acid-Containing Phospholipids and Drives Sexually Dimorphic Liver Disease in Mice\nAuthors: Zelows, M.

N.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553705\nBackground and AimsGenome and epigenome wide association studies identified variants in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) that associate with lipid traits. The goal of this study was to determine the impact by which liver-specific CPT1a deletion impacts hepatic lipid metabolism. Approach and ResultsSix-to-eight-week old male and female liver-specific knockout (LKO) and littermate controls were placed on a low-fat or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 15 weeks. Mice were necropsied after a 16 hour fast, and tissues were collected for lipidomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), kinome analysis, RNA-sequencing, and protein expression by immunoblotting. Female LKO mice had increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels which were associated with greater deposition of hepatic lipids, while male mice were not affected by CPT1a deletion relative to male control mice. Mice with CPT1a deletion had reductions in DHA-containing phospholipids at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-containing phospholipids in both whole liver and at the level of the lipid droplet (LD). Male and female LKO mice increased RNA levels of genes involved in LD lipolysis (Plin2, Cidec, G0S2) and in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism (Elovl5, Fads1, Elovl2), while only female LKO mice increased genes involved in inflammation (Ly6d, Mmp12, Cxcl2). Kinase profiling showed decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which coincided with increased PLIN2, PLIN5, and G0S2 protein levels and decreased triglyceride hydrolysis in LKO mice. ConclusionsLiver-specific deletion of CPT1a promotes sexually dimorphic steatotic liver disease (SLD) in mice, and here we have identified new mechanisms by which females are protected from HFD-induced liver injury.

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs). However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal specialization drives the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct from other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy. Our data question the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types based on the expression of MYHs in humans and identifies ribosomal specialization as a major driver of skeletal muscle heterogeneity, opening a new field of research within skeletal muscle physiology.

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na&#43; channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na&#43; channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na&#43; channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na&#43; currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na&#43; currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose, but not lower concentrations, was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice. These effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the main target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity.

MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.

ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.

ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

        <p class="abstract">Contraction force in muscle is produced by the interaction of myosin motors in the thick filaments and actin in the thin filaments and is fine-tuned by other proteins such as myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). One form of control is through the regulation of myosin heads between an ON and OFF state in passive sarcomeres, which leads to their ability or inability to interact with the thin filaments during contraction, respectively. MyBP-C is a flexible and long protein that is tightly bound to the thick filament at its C-terminal end but may be loosely bound at its middle- and N-terminal end (MyBP-CC1C7). Under considerable debate is whether the MyBP-CC1C7 domains directly regulate myosin head ON/OFF states, and/or link thin filaments (&#34;C-links&#34;). Here, we used a combination of mechanics and small-angle X-ray diffraction to study the immediate and selective removal of the MyBP-CC1C7 domains of fast MyBP-C in permeabilized skeletal muscle. After cleavage, the thin filaments were significantly shorter, a result consistent with direct interactions of MyBP-C with thin filaments thus confirming C-links. Ca2&#43; sensitivity was reduced at shorter sarcomere lengths, and crossbridge kinetics were increased across sarcomere lengths at submaximal activation levels, demonstrating a role in crossbridge kinetics. Structural signatures of the thick filaments suggest that cleavage also shifted myosin heads towards the ON state - a marker that typically indicates increased Ca2&#43; sensitivity but that may account for increased crossbridge kinetics at submaximal Ca2&#43; and/or a change in the force transmission pathway. Taken together, we conclude that MyBP-CC1C7 domains play an important role in contractile performance which helps explain why mutations in these domains often lead to debilitating diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process.

HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the beige adipogenesis derived from SMA&#43; APCs.

        <p class="abstract">The development of non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain is a pressing area of unmet clinical need. To address this, we examined the expression of Gi/o-coupled receptors in colonic sensory neurons, which, like opioid receptors, have the potential to inhibit nociceptor activation due to their inhibitory G protein coupling. This led to the identification of the orphan receptor GPR35 as a visceral analgesic drug target due to its marked co-expression with TRPA1, a mediator of noxious mechanotransduction in the bowel. Consistent with in silico docking studies which identified binding sites for the mast cell stabiliser cromolyn and phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast at GPR35, we demonstrated using GPR35 knockout mice that the antinociceptive effects of these drugs on TRPA1-mediated colonic nociceptor activation and mechanosensitisation were GPR35-dependent. Further work showed these antinociceptive effects occurred through the inhibition of substance P (SP) release. This confirmed both the pronociceptive effect of SP on colonic afferents, and the contribution of SP to TRPA1-mediated colonic nociceptor activation and sensitisation. We also found that TRPA1-induced contraction of the colon was mediated by SP signalling and could be inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. Our data identify GPR35, through its inhibition of SP-mediated colonic contractility and nociceptor activation and sensitisation, as a putative mechanism for the reported clinical efficacy of cromolyn in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. These findings highlight the potential utility of GPR35 agonists to deliver non-opioid analgesia for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart rate increases with heat, [1-3] constituting a fundamental physiological relationship in vertebrates. Each normal heartbeat is initiated by an action potential generated in a sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cell. Pacemaker cells are enriched with hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCN) that deliver cell membrane depolarizing inward current that triggers action potentials. HCN channel current increases due to cAMP binding, a mechanism coupling adrenergic tone to physiological  fight or flight heart rate acceleration. However, the mechanism(s) for heart rate response to thermal energy is unknown. We used thermodynamical and homology computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and mouse models to identify a concise motif on the S4-S5 linker of the cardiac pacemaker HCN4 channels (M407/Y409) that determines HCN4 current (If) and cardiac pacemaker cell responses to heat. This motif is required for heat sensing in cardiac pacemaker cells and in isolated hearts. In contrast, the cyclic nucleotide binding domain is not required for heat induced HCN4 current increases. However, a loss of function M407/Y409 motif mutation prevented normal heat and cAMP responses, suggesting that heat sensing machinery is essential for operating the cAMP allosteric pathway and is central to HCN4 modulation. The M407/Y409 motif is conserved across all HCN family members suggesting that HCN channels participate broadly in coupling heat to changes in cell membrane excitability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Elevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a risk factor and component that worsens cardiovascular disease states. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental action, via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and has been shown to disrupt vascular function. In this study, we determined whether oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments were isolated from intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and incubated with oxLDL ex vivo (50ug/dL; 2h). Using wire myography, cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (PE) were generated to determine contractile responses. From these curves, the EC50 was determined and used to contract rings to assess acetylcholine (ACh) dependent relaxation. Calculated aortic stiffness and remodeling, as well as mRNA expression of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed. BI-0115 (10M; selective LOX-1 inhibitor) was used to determine LOX-1 dependence. We observed differential sex, age, endothelial cell, and LOX-1 dependent alterations to the efficacy of PE-induced contractile responses and ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in the thoracic aortic rings following oxLDL exposure. Additionally, we observed a distinct sex and age effect on thoracic aortic stiffness following exposure to oxLDL. There was also a sex effect on calculated vessel diameter, as well as an age effect on oxLDL-mediated inward remodeling that was LOX-1 dependent. Thus, LOX-1 inhibition and the resulting attenuation of oxLDL/endothelial-mediated alterations in aortic function suggests that there are differential sex differences in the role of oxLDL/LOX-1 in the thoracic aorta of male and female mice.

NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHYWe investigated the effects of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) via the LOX-1 receptor on murine thoracic aortic vasoreactivity, stiffness, and remodeling across age and sex. Acute exposure to oxLDL led to altered vasoreactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in aortic stiffness and remodeling. These effects were in-part age, sex, endothelial, and LOX-1 dependent. This study reveals potential complex interactions in oxLDL/LOX-1-mediated vascular responses that could serve as potential therapeutic intervention for vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

        <p class="abstract">Chill susceptible insects are thought to be injured through different mechanisms depending on the duration and severity of chilling. While chronic chilling causes &#34;indirect&#34; injury through disruption of metabolic and ion homeostasis, acute chilling is suspected to cause &#34;direct&#34; injury, in part through phase transitions of cell membrane lipids. Dietary supplementation of cholesterol can reduce acute chilling injury in Drosophila melanogaster, but the generality of this effect and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. To better understand how and why cholesterol has this effect, we assessed how a high cholesterol diet and thermal acclimation independently and interactively impact several measures of chill tolerance in both male and female flies. Cholesterol supplementation positively affected tolerance to acute chilling in warm-acclimated flies (as reported previously). Conversely, feeding on the high-cholesterol diet negatively affected tolerance to chronic chilling in both cold and warm acclimated flies, as well as tolerance to acute chilling in cold acclimated flies. Cholesterol had no effect on the ability of flies to remain active in the cold or recover movement after a cold stress. Our findings support the idea that dietary cholesterol reduces mechanical injury to membranes caused by direct chilling injury, and that acute and chronic chilling are associated with distinct mechanisms of injury. Feeding on a high-cholesterol diet may interfere with mechanisms involved in cold acclimation, leaving cholesterol augmented flies more susceptible to chilling injury under some conditions.

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsGenome and epigenome wide association studies identified variants in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) that associate with lipid traits. The goal of this study was to determine the impact by which liver-specific CPT1a deletion impacts hepatic lipid metabolism.

Approach and ResultsSix-to-eight-week old male and female liver-specific knockout (LKO) and littermate controls were placed on a low-fat or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 15 weeks. Mice were necropsied after a 16 hour fast, and tissues were collected for lipidomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), kinome analysis, RNA-sequencing, and protein expression by immunoblotting. Female LKO mice had increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels which were associated with greater deposition of hepatic lipids, while male mice were not affected by CPT1a deletion relative to male control mice. Mice with CPT1a deletion had reductions in DHA-containing phospholipids at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-containing phospholipids in both whole liver and at the level of the lipid droplet (LD). Male and female LKO mice increased RNA levels of genes involved in LD lipolysis (Plin2, Cidec, G0S2) and in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism (Elovl5, Fads1, Elovl2), while only female LKO mice increased genes involved in inflammation (Ly6d, Mmp12, Cxcl2). Kinase profiling showed decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which coincided with increased PLIN2, PLIN5, and G0S2 protein levels and decreased triglyceride hydrolysis in LKO mice.

ConclusionsLiver-specific deletion of CPT1a promotes sexually dimorphic steatotic liver disease (SLD) in mice, and here we have identified new mechanisms by which females are protected from HFD-induced liver injury.
