In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1+/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.\nMXRA8 promotes adipose tissue whitening to drive obesity\nAuthors: Jia, W.; Giwa, R.; Moley, J. R.; Smith, G. I.; Petersen, M. C.; Field, R. L.; Abousaway, O.; Kim, A. S.; Coffey, S. R.; Varnum, S.; Wright, J. M.; Zhang, X.; Krysa, S.; Lodhi, I. J.; Abumrad, N. A.; Klein, S.; Diamond, M. S.; Brestoff, J. R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578211\nMatrix-remodeling associated 8 (MXRA8), also known as Dual immunoglobulin domain cell adhesion molecule (DICAM), is a type 1 transmembrane protein that reportedly binds the V{beta}3 integrin1 and regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts2 and chondrocytes, tumor growth, T cell trafficking, and angiogenesis. MXRA8 is also an essential entry receptor for chikungunya virus and other related arthritogenic alphaviruses. We compared MXRA8 expression in 51 tissues in the Human Protein Atlas and found it is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), however the function of MXRA8 in WAT is unknown. Here, we found that MXRA8 expression in WAT is increased in people with obesity and that this response is also observed in a mouse model of high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analyses revealed that MXRA8 is expressed predominantly by adipocyte progenitor (AP) cells and mature adipocytes. MXRA8 mutant primary adipocytes from inguinal (i)WAT exhibited increased expression of Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein expressed by beige and brown adipocytes that limits obesity pathogenesis. Indeed, MXRA8 mutant mice fed a HFD had preserved UCP1+ beige and brown adipocytes and were protected from HFD-induced obesity in a UCP1-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings indicate that MXRA8 promotes whitening of beige and brown adipose tissues to drive obesity pathogenesis and identify MXRA8 as a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.\nEarly body weight gain in TALLYHO/JngJ mice predicts adult diabetic phenotype, mimicking childhood obesity\nAuthors: Hastreiter, S.; Hoffmann, S.; Richter, K.; Irmler, M.; Gerlini, R.; Fuchs, H.; Gailus-Dumer, V.; Gailus-Durner, V.; Korner, A.; Hrabe de Angelis, M.; Beckers, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577705\nChildhood obesity and type 2 diabetes are two emerging health issues worldwide. To analyze their underlying causes and develop prevention strategies, mouse models are urgently needed. We present novel insights into the polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model for diabetes. By precisely analyzing our original phenotypic data, we discovered that body weight at weaning age is the main predictor of the adult phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice. The higher the weaning weight of male mice, the more likely they are to develop diabetes later in life. In contrast, a low weaning weight protected against the development of the diabetic phenotype in adults. In females, we found that high weaning body weights led to a constant higher body weight throughout life. We also showed that specifically the suckling period, rather than the in utero period, is crucial for the development of the metabolic phenotype in later life. We observed an earlier onset of diabetes when the mice had higher body weights at weaning, aligning with metabolic histories observed in humans. Therefore, we recommend TALLYHO/JngJ mice as a model to investigate childhood obesity and to develop prevention strategies.\nCardiomyocyte PGC-1α enables physiological adaptations to endurance exercise through suppression of GDF15 and cardiac atrophy\nAuthors: Khetarpal, S.

A.; Kuznetsov, A.; Freeman, R.; Bogoslavski, D.; Ellinor, P. T.; Asnani, A.; Dumesic, P. A.; Puigserver, P.; Roh, J. D.; Spiegelman, B. M.; Rosenzweig, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578093\nExercise training induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and myocardial contractility. In skeletal muscle, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is a key orchestrator of these responses. The heart expresses abundant and exercise-responsive PGC-1, but it is unclear whether cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is necessary for cardiac adaptation to endurance training. Here we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is required for physiological cardiac hypertrophy during exercise training in mice. In the absence of cardiomyocyte PGC-1, voluntary wheel running does not improve exercise capacity and instead confers immune-fibrotic-atrophic heart failure after just 6 weeks of training. We identify cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a negative regulator of stress-responsive senescence gene expression. The most enriched of these is the myomitokine GDF15. GDF15 is secreted locally but not systemically in PGC-1-deficient mouse hearts and reduces cardiomyocyte size. Cardiomyocyte-specific reduction of GDF15 expression preserves exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility in PGC-1-deficient mice during endurance training. Finally, we show that cardiomyocyte PPARGC1A expression correlates with cardiomyocyte number and negatively with GDF15 expression in human cardiomyopathies through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Our data implicate cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a vital safeguard against stress-induced atrophy and local GDF15-induced dysfunction during exercise.\nNPAS4 is an allostatic regulator of POMC neuronal activity during diet-induced obesity\nAuthors: Yoon, J. S.; Gamu, D.; Gibson, W. T.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.574247\nRationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity. MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons. ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates. ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.\nBehavioural responses to acute warming precede critical shifts in the cellular and physiological thermal stress responses in fish\nAuthors: Durhack, T. C.; Thorstensen, M. J.; Mackey, T. E.; Aminot, M.; Lawrence, M. J.; Audet, C.; Enders, E. C.; Jeffries, K. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577477\nFrom a conservation perspective, it is important to identify when sub-lethal temperatures begin to adversely impact an organism. However, it is unclear whether, during acute exposures, these cellular thresholds occur at similar temperatures to other physiological or behavioural changes. To test this, we estimated temperature preference (15.1 {+/-} 1.1 {degrees}C) using a shuttle box, thermal optima for aerobic scope (10--15 {degrees}C) using respirometry, agitation temperature (22.0 {+/-} 1.4 {degrees}C) as the point where a fish exhibits a behavioural avoidance response and the CTmax (28.2 {+/-} 0.4 {degrees}C) as the upper thermal limit for 1 yr old Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) acclimated to 10 {degrees}C. We then acutely exposed a different subset of fish to these temperatures and sampled tissues when they reached the target temperature or after 60 min of recovery at 10 {degrees}C. We used qPCR to estimate mRNA transcript levels of genes associated with heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inducible transcription factors. A major shift in the transcriptome response occurred near the agitation temperature, which may identify a link between the cellular stress response and the behavioural avoidance response.\nATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 constrains metabolic responses to high-fat diet in male mice\nAuthors: Villalobos, E.; Miguelez-Crespo, A.; Morgan, R. A.; Ivatt, L.; Kurian, D.; Aguilar, J.; Kline, R. A.; Wishart, T. M.; Morton, N.; Stimson, R. H.; Andrew, R.; Walker, B. R.; Nixon, M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576896\nGlucocorticoids modulate glucose homeostasis, acting on metabolically active tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Intra-cellular regulation of glucocorticoid action in adipose tissue impacts metabolic responses to obesity. ATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 (ABCC1) is a transmembrane glucocorticoid transporter known to limit the accumulation of exogenously administered corticosterone in adipose tissue. However, the role of ABCC1 in the regulation of endogenous glucocorticoid action and its impact on fuel metabolism has not been studied. Here, we investigate the impact of Abcc1 deficiency on glucocorticoid action and high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In lean mice, deficiency of Abcc1 increased endogenous corticosterone levels in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but did not impact insulin sensitivity. In contrast, Abcc1-deficient mice on HFD displayed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia, without alterations in tissue corticosterone levels. Proteomics and bulk RNA sequencing in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle revealed that Abcc1 deficiency amplified the transcriptional response to an obesogenic diet in adipose tissue. Moreover, the Abcc1 deficiency impairs key signalling pathways related to glucose metabolism in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, in particular those related to OXPHOS machinery and Glut4. Together, our results highlight a role for ABCC1 in regulating glucose homeostasis, demonstrating diet-dependent effects that are not associated with altered tissue glucocorticoid concentrations.\nInhibition of IRAK4 by microbial trimethylamine blunts metabolic inflammation and ameliorates glycemic control\nAuthors: Chilloux, J.; Brial, F.; Everard, A.; Smyth, D.; Andrikopoulos, P.; Zhang, L.; Plovier, H.; Myridakis, A.; Hoyles, L.; Moreno-Navarrete, J.

K.; Federici, M.; Fernandez-Real, J. M.; Gauguier, D.; Liu, P. P.; Cani, P. D.; Dumas, M.-E. E.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/277434\nThe global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis and there is a critical need for innovative strategies to fight it. Although the microbiome plays important roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation, the microbial compounds regulating these phenomena remain to be discovered. Here, we reveal that the microbiome inhibits a central kinase, eliciting immune and metabolic benefits. Through a series of in vivo experiments based on choline supplementation, blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production then administering TMA, we demonstrate that TMA decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Through in vitro kinome screens, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase integrating signals from various toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells, and improves mouse survival after a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Consistent with this, genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears to be a key microbial compound inhibiting IRAK4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.\nBody temperature regulates glucose metabolism and torpid\nAuthors: Lee, M.-l.; Chang, C.-P.; Toda, C.; Nemoto, T.; Enoki, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577738\nGlucose is a significant energy resource for maintaining physiological activities, including body temperature homeostasis, and glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated in mammals. Although ambient temperature tunes glucose metabolism to maintain euthermia, the significance of body temperature in metabolic regulation remains unclear owing to strict thermoregulation. Activation of Qrfp neurons in the preoptic area induced a harmless hypothermic state known as Q-neuron-induced hypothermia and hypometabolism (QIH), which is suitable for studying glucose metabolism under hypothermia. In this study, we first observed that QIH mice had hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This glucose hypometabolic state was abolished by increasing the body temperature to euthermia. Moreover, QIH-mediated inappetence and locomotor inactivity were recovered in euthermia QIH mice. These results indicate that body temperature is considerably more powerful than ambient temperature in regulating glucose metabolism and behavior, and hypometabolism in QIH is secondary to hypothermia rather than modulated by Qrfp neurons. HighlightsO_LIQIH reorganizes glucose homeostasis which is unchanged by fasting. C_LIO_LIQIH mice exhibit glucose hypometabolism with hyperinsuliemia and insulin resistance. C_LIO_LIIncreased body temperature abolishes QIH-mediated hypometabolism and torpid behaviors. C_LIO_LIBody temperature is a strong factor in controlling metabolism and behavior. C_LIO_LIBody temperature-mediated glucose metabolism is reversible. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1&#43;/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Matrix-remodeling associated 8 (MXRA8), also known as Dual immunoglobulin domain cell adhesion molecule (DICAM), is a type 1 transmembrane protein that reportedly binds the V{beta}3 integrin1 and regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts2 and chondrocytes, tumor growth, T cell trafficking, and angiogenesis. MXRA8 is also an essential entry receptor for chikungunya virus and other related arthritogenic alphaviruses. We compared MXRA8 expression in 51 tissues in the Human Protein Atlas and found it is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), however the function of MXRA8 in WAT is unknown. Here, we found that MXRA8 expression in WAT is increased in people with obesity and that this response is also observed in a mouse model of high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analyses revealed that MXRA8 is expressed predominantly by adipocyte progenitor (AP) cells and mature adipocytes. MXRA8 mutant primary adipocytes from inguinal (i)WAT exhibited increased expression of Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein expressed by beige and brown adipocytes that limits obesity pathogenesis. Indeed, MXRA8 mutant mice fed a HFD had preserved UCP1&#43; beige and brown adipocytes and were protected from HFD-induced obesity in a UCP1-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings indicate that MXRA8 promotes whitening of beige and brown adipose tissues to drive obesity pathogenesis and identify MXRA8 as a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes are two emerging health issues worldwide. To analyze their underlying causes and develop prevention strategies, mouse models are urgently needed. We present novel insights into the polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model for diabetes. By precisely analyzing our original phenotypic data, we discovered that body weight at weaning age is the main predictor of the adult phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice. The higher the weaning weight of male mice, the more likely they are to develop diabetes later in life. In contrast, a low weaning weight protected against the development of the diabetic phenotype in adults. In females, we found that high weaning body weights led to a constant higher body weight throughout life. We also showed that specifically the suckling period, rather than the in utero period, is crucial for the development of the metabolic phenotype in later life. We observed an earlier onset of diabetes when the mice had higher body weights at weaning, aligning with metabolic histories observed in humans. Therefore, we recommend TALLYHO/JngJ mice as a model to investigate childhood obesity and to develop prevention strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise training induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and myocardial contractility. In skeletal muscle, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is a key orchestrator of these responses. The heart expresses abundant and exercise-responsive PGC-1, but it is unclear whether cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is necessary for cardiac adaptation to endurance training. Here we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is required for physiological cardiac hypertrophy during exercise training in mice. In the absence of cardiomyocyte PGC-1, voluntary wheel running does not improve exercise capacity and instead confers immune-fibrotic-atrophic heart failure after just 6 weeks of training. We identify cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a negative regulator of stress-responsive senescence gene expression. The most enriched of these is the myomitokine GDF15. GDF15 is secreted locally but not systemically in PGC-1-deficient mouse hearts and reduces cardiomyocyte size. Cardiomyocyte-specific reduction of GDF15 expression preserves exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility in PGC-1-deficient mice during endurance training. Finally, we show that cardiomyocyte PPARGC1A expression correlates with cardiomyocyte number and negatively with GDF15 expression in human cardiomyopathies through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Our data implicate cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a vital safeguard against stress-induced atrophy and local GDF15-induced dysfunction during exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity.

MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons.

ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates.

ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From a conservation perspective, it is important to identify when sub-lethal temperatures begin to adversely impact an organism. However, it is unclear whether, during acute exposures, these cellular thresholds occur at similar temperatures to other physiological or behavioural changes. To test this, we estimated temperature preference (15.1 {&#43;/-} 1.1 {degrees}C) using a shuttle box, thermal optima for aerobic scope (10--15 {degrees}C) using respirometry, agitation temperature (22.0 {&#43;/-} 1.4 {degrees}C) as the point where a fish exhibits a behavioural avoidance response and the CTmax (28.2 {&#43;/-} 0.4 {degrees}C) as the upper thermal limit for 1 yr old Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) acclimated to 10 {degrees}C. We then acutely exposed a different subset of fish to these temperatures and sampled tissues when they reached the target temperature or after 60 min of recovery at 10 {degrees}C. We used qPCR to estimate mRNA transcript levels of genes associated with heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inducible transcription factors. A major shift in the transcriptome response occurred near the agitation temperature, which may identify a link between the cellular stress response and the behavioural avoidance response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucocorticoids modulate glucose homeostasis, acting on metabolically active tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Intra-cellular regulation of glucocorticoid action in adipose tissue impacts metabolic responses to obesity. ATP-Binding Cassette Family C member 1 (ABCC1) is a transmembrane glucocorticoid transporter known to limit the accumulation of exogenously administered corticosterone in adipose tissue. However, the role of ABCC1 in the regulation of endogenous glucocorticoid action and its impact on fuel metabolism has not been studied. Here, we investigate the impact of Abcc1 deficiency on glucocorticoid action and high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In lean mice, deficiency of Abcc1 increased endogenous corticosterone levels in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but did not impact insulin sensitivity. In contrast, Abcc1-deficient mice on HFD displayed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia, without alterations in tissue corticosterone levels. Proteomics and bulk RNA sequencing in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle revealed that Abcc1 deficiency amplified the transcriptional response to an obesogenic diet in adipose tissue. Moreover, the Abcc1 deficiency impairs key signalling pathways related to glucose metabolism in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, in particular those related to OXPHOS machinery and Glut4. Together, our results highlight a role for ABCC1 in regulating glucose homeostasis, demonstrating diet-dependent effects that are not associated with altered tissue glucocorticoid concentrations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis and there is a critical need for innovative strategies to fight it. Although the microbiome plays important roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation, the microbial compounds regulating these phenomena remain to be discovered. Here, we reveal that the microbiome inhibits a central kinase, eliciting immune and metabolic benefits. Through a series of in vivo experiments based on choline supplementation, blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production then administering TMA, we demonstrate that TMA decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Through in vitro kinome screens, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase integrating signals from various toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells, and improves mouse survival after a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Consistent with this, genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears to be a key microbial compound inhibiting IRAK4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucose is a significant energy resource for maintaining physiological activities, including body temperature homeostasis, and glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated in mammals. Although ambient temperature tunes glucose metabolism to maintain euthermia, the significance of body temperature in metabolic regulation remains unclear owing to strict thermoregulation. Activation of Qrfp neurons in the preoptic area induced a harmless hypothermic state known as Q-neuron-induced hypothermia and hypometabolism (QIH), which is suitable for studying glucose metabolism under hypothermia. In this study, we first observed that QIH mice had hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This glucose hypometabolic state was abolished by increasing the body temperature to euthermia. Moreover, QIH-mediated inappetence and locomotor inactivity were recovered in euthermia QIH mice. These results indicate that body temperature is considerably more powerful than ambient temperature in regulating glucose metabolism and behavior, and hypometabolism in QIH is secondary to hypothermia rather than modulated by Qrfp neurons.
