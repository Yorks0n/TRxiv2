H.; Patapoutian, A.\nScore: 164.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.565646\nThe kidneys tightly control the composition of our internal environment to maintain homeostasis in the face of external variability. The regulation of blood volume begins in the kidneys and is essential for vertebrate life in terrestrial environments where salt and water availability are unpredictable. Renin synthesis and release by juxtaglomerular granular cells of the kidney is the rate-limiting step in a hormonal cascade that modulates blood volume, filtration, and salt balance. Renin is stimulated during hypovolemia and salt deprivation in response to chemical cues released from sympathetic efferent neurons and the macula densa onto the juxtaglomerular granular cells. Renin levels are also proposed to be modulated by mechanical forces elicited by changes in blood volume and/or pressure exerted upon juxtaglomerular cells. However, the identity and significance of the juxtaglomerular mechanotransducer(s) was unknown. We found that the force-gated ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in juxtaglomerular granular cells and in neighboring mesangial cells. Selective genetic ablation of PIEZO2 dysregulated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by elevating renin, raising systemic blood pressure, inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, and exaggerating the hormonal response to volume depletion. These findings demonstrate that PIEZO2 contributes to renal blood volume sensing and kidney function in vivo.\nPhysiology of the Weight Loss Plateau after Calorie Restriction, GLP-1 Receptor Agonism, and Bariatric Surgery\nAuthors: Hall, K. D.\nScore: 46.5, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565699\nObjective: To investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus. Methods: A validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite. Results: RYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau. Conclusions: These preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.\nResistance exercise protects mice from protein-induced fat accretion\nAuthors: Trautman, M. E.; Braucher, L. N.; Elliehausen, C.; Zhu, W. G.; Zelenovskiy, E.; Green, M.; Sonsalla, M. M.; Yeh, C.-Y.; Hornberger, T. A.; Konopka, A. R.; Lamming, D. W.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.18.512689\nLow protein (LP) diets extend the lifespan of diverse species, and are associated with improved metabolic health in both rodents and humans. Paradoxically, many athletes and bodybuilders consume high protein (HP) diets and protein supplements, yet are both fit and metabolically healthy. Here, we examine this paradox using weight pulling, a validated progressive resistance exercise training regimen, in mice fed either an LP diet or an isocaloric HP diet. We find that despite having lower food consumption than the LP group, HP-fed mice gain significantly more fat mass than LP-fed mice when not exercising, while weight pulling protected HP-fed mice from this excess fat accretion. The HP diet augmented exercise-induced hypertrophy of the forearm flexor complex, and weight pulling ability increased more rapidly in the exercised HP-fed mice. Surprisingly, exercise did not protect from HP-induced changes in glycemic control. Our results confirm that HP diets can augment muscle hypertrophy and accelerate strength gain induced by resistance exercise without negative effects on fat mass, and also demonstrate that LP diets may be advantageous in the sedentary. Our results highlight the need to consider both dietary composition and activity, not simply calories, when taking a precision nutrition approach to health.\nForce sensation by a Gs-coupled adhesion GPCR mediates equilibrioception by increasing vestibular hair cell membrane excitability and CNGA3 coupling\nAuthors: yang, z.; zhou, s.; zhang, q.; liu, w.; sun, y.; qi, j.; guan, y.; wang, m.; song, z.; sun, y.; yang, w.; Yu, X.; chai, r.; Sun, J.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563886\nEquilibrioception is essential for the perception and navigation of mammals in the three-dimensional world. The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process in vestibular hair cells is believed to play central roles in positional and motional sensation. However, the direct equilibrioception sensor at the molecular level is not clear, and the mechanism underlying the MET process in vestibular hair cells remains elusive. Here, we identified that the G protein-coupled receptor LPHN2, which is expressed in the cuticular plate of utricular hair cells, is required for normal balance maintenance. The sensation of force by LPHN2 in the utricular hair cells increased intracellular cAMP levels in a Gs-dependent manner. The direct association of LPHN2 with the ion channel CNGA3 and increased cAMP levels enabled the activation of CNGA3, which induced calcium influx and membrane depolarization. These cellular signals and balance-related functions were significantly weakened in Lphn2+/- mice, Pou4f3-CreER+/- Lphn2fl/flmice and Pou4f3-CreER+/-Cnga3fl/+ mice and could be suppressed by Gs or CNGA3 inhibitors. Collectively, our data suggested that LPHN2 could be a direct equilibrioception sensor in utricular hair cells by converting the force sensation to electrical signals through Gs and CNGA3 coupling. Both GPCR members and the ion channel CNGA3 could be essential elements for equilibrioception.\nForce sensing GPR133 is essential for normal balance and modulates vestibular hair cell membrane excitability via Gi signaling and CNGA3 coupling\nAuthors: yang, z.; zhou, s.; wang, m.; ping, y.; fu, x.; zhao, r.; xiao, p.; lu, y.; zhang, q.; song, z.; xi, y.; lin, h.; zheng, y.; qin, w.; yi, f.; Yu, X.; chai, r.; Sun, J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563882\nThe maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.\nSingle-nucleus transcriptomics of epicardial adipose tissue from females reveals exercise control of innate and adaptive immune cells\nAuthors: Ahmad, I.; Gupta, S. C.; Faulkner, P.; Mullens, D.; Thomas, M.; Sytha, S. P.; Ivanov, I.; Cai, J. J.; Heaps, C. L.; Newell-Fugate, A. E.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565385\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in women. Although exercise mitigates CAD, the mechanisms by which exercise impacts epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) are unknown. We hypothesized that exercise promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in EAT from female pigs. Yucatan pigs (n=7) were assigned to sedentary (Sed) or exercise (Ex) treatments and coronary arteries were occluded (O) with an ameroid to mimic CAD or remained non-occluded (N). EAT was collected for bulk and single nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq). Exercise upregulated G-protein coupled receptor, S100 family, and FAK pathways and downregulated the coagulation pathway. Exercise increased the interaction between immune, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells in the insulin-like growth factor pathway and between endothelial and other cell types in the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 pathway. Sub-clustering revealed nine cell types in EAT with fibroblast and macrophage populations predominant in O-Ex EAT and T cell population predominant in N-Ex EAT. Coronary occlusion impacted the largest number of genes in T and endothelial cells. Genes related to fatty acid metabolism were the most highly upregulated in non-immune cells from O-Ex EAT. Sub-clustering of endothelial cells revealed that N-Ex EAT separated from other treatments. In conclusion, aerobic exercise increased interaction amongst immune and mesenchymal and endothelial cells in female EAT. Exercise was minimally effective at reversing alterations in gene expression in endothelial and mesenchymal cells in EAT surrounding occluded arteries. These findings lay the foundation for future work focused on the impact of exercise on cell types in EAT.\nForce-sensing LPHN2 is indispensable for normal hearing and mediates MET in cochleae through Gs and CNGA3 coupling\nAuthors: Yang, Z.; Wang, M.-W.; Zhou, S.-H.; Song, Z.-c.; Gao, J.-R.; Liu, W.-W.; Zhang, Q.-Y.; Guan, Y.; Xu, L.; Wang, C.; Xu, Z.-G.; Yu, X.; Sun, J.-P.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563883\nAuditory perception enables acoustic experiences, including listening to melodious music and engaging in linguistic communication. Conversion of the force sensation into electrical signals via mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) in cochlear hair cells is the key step for auditory perception; however, the sound receptor for auditory perception at the molecular level is not clear. Here, we found that hair cell-specific deficiency of the G protein-coupled receptor LPHN2 in Pou4f3-CreER+/-Lphn2fl/fl mice or pharmacological blockade of CNG ion channels in mice severely impaired hearing. Importantly, sensation of force by LPHN2 not only increased intracellular cAMP and calcium levels but also elicited rapid membrane depolarization of cochlear hair cells via Gs-dependent CNGA3 coupling. Both LPHN2 and CNGA3 were expressed at the stereocilia and cuticular plates and associated with each other. Notably, hearing loss in LPHN2-deficient mice was almost fully reversed by re-expression of LPHN2-GAIN in cochlear hair cells. Therefore, we propose that LPHN2 acts as a direct sound sensor in cochlear hair cells by mediating MET through Gs and CNGA3 coupling. Furthermore, both GPCR members and ion channels modulated by second messengers might actively participate in the MET process during auditory perception.\nDrosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling reveals age related loss of intestinal amino acid transport regulates longevity\nAuthors: Mornement, A. A.; Dack, R. E.; Doupe, D. P.; Clark, R. I.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564159\nAge-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies. In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies. Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.\nFeeding Behavior Modifies Daily Rhythms in Autonomic Signaling and Core Body Temperature to Shape 24-hour Rhythms in Cardiac Electrophysiology\nAuthors: Ono, M.; Burgess, D.; Johnson, S. R.; Elayi, C. S.; Esser, K. A.; Seward, T. S.; Boychuk, C. A.; Stalcup, R. A.; Prabhat, A.; Schroder, E.; Delisle, B. P.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565372\nBackground: Circadian rhythms in physiology optimize organismal behavior to anticipate predictable environmental changes. Modern lifestyles can cause misalignment between {approx}24-hour rhythms in feeding behavior from daily environmental cycles. Feeding behavior is a potent behavioral zeitgeber (timekeeping cue). We determined how shifting the timing of feeding behavior impacts the alignment of {approx}24-hour rhythms in HR and cardiac electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) and Scn5a+/{Delta}KPQ mice. Methods: Mice eat most of their daily calories during the dark cycle. We shifted limited their food access to the light cycle (light-cycle restricted feeding or L-RF). Telemetry was used to continuously record changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), core body temperature (Tb), and activity. Cosinor and cross correlation analyses were used to analyze rhythmicity and 24-hour alignment between variables. Results: L-RF for one day caused the 24-hour rhythms of the RR, QT, and PR intervals to shift 7-9 hours. The changes in the 24-hour ECG rhythms before and after the start of L-RF mirrored changes in daily body temperature (Tb) rhythm and correlated with changes in the high frequency (pHF) component of heart rate variability. Injecting mice undergoing L-RF with propranolol and atropine reduced the pHF component and caused a loss in the 24-hour rhythm in the RR interval and Tb. We identified a strong linear relation between the the QT interval and Tb. Normalizing the QT interval for Tb eliminated the 24-hour rhythm in the QT interval and identified abnormal changes in the QT interval in WT and Scn5a+/{Delta}KPQ mice during L-RF. Conclusion: Altering the timing of daily feeding behavior reshapes 24-hour rhythms in cardiac electrophysiology in mice by modifying daily rhythms in autonomic signaling and Tb. There is a strong linear relation between the QT interval and Tb. Normalizing the QT for Tb is important for identifying QT interval prolongation independent of Tb.\nLoss of CTRP10 results in female obesity with preserved metabolic health\nAuthors: Chen, F.; Sarver, D. C.; Saqib, M.; Velez, L. M.; Aja, S.; Seldin, M. M.; Wong, G. W.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565163\nObesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Intriguingly, there is a subset of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals who are seemingly able to maintain a healthy metabolic profile free of metabolic syndrome. The molecular underpinnings of MHO, however, are not well understood. Here, we report that CTRP10/C1QL2-deficient mice represent a unique female model of MHO. CTRP10 modulates weight gain in a striking and sexually dimorphic manner. Female, but not male, mice lacking CTRP10 develop obesity with age on a low-fat diet while maintaining an otherwise healthy metabolic profile. When fed an obesogenic diet, female Ctrp10 knockout (KO) mice show rapid weight gain. Despite pronounced obesity, Ctrp10 KO female mice do not develop steatosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, or low-grade inflammation. Obesity is largely uncoupled from metabolic dysregulation in female KO mice. Multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses highlighted gene expression changes and pathways associated with insulin-sensitive obesity. Transcriptional correlation of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) orthologous in humans also show sex differences in gene connectivity within and across metabolic tissues, underscoring the conserved sex-dependent function of CTRP10. Collectively, our findings suggest that CTRP10 negatively regulates body weight in females, and that loss of CTRP10 results in benign obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This female MHO mouse model is valuable for understanding sex-biased mechanisms that uncouple obesity from metabolic dysfunction.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The kidneys tightly control the composition of our internal environment to maintain homeostasis in the face of external variability. The regulation of blood volume begins in the kidneys and is essential for vertebrate life in terrestrial environments where salt and water availability are unpredictable. Renin synthesis and release by juxtaglomerular granular cells of the kidney is the rate-limiting step in a hormonal cascade that modulates blood volume, filtration, and salt balance. Renin is stimulated during hypovolemia and salt deprivation in response to chemical cues released from sympathetic efferent neurons and the macula densa onto the juxtaglomerular granular cells. Renin levels are also proposed to be modulated by mechanical forces elicited by changes in blood volume and/or pressure exerted upon juxtaglomerular cells. However, the identity and significance of the juxtaglomerular mechanotransducer(s) was unknown. We found that the force-gated ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in juxtaglomerular granular cells and in neighboring mesangial cells. Selective genetic ablation of PIEZO2 dysregulated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by elevating renin, raising systemic blood pressure, inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, and exaggerating the hormonal response to volume depletion. These findings demonstrate that PIEZO2 contributes to renal blood volume sensing and kidney function in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: To investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus. Methods: A validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite. Results: RYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau. Conclusions: These preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low protein (LP) diets extend the lifespan of diverse species, and are associated with improved metabolic health in both rodents and humans. Paradoxically, many athletes and bodybuilders consume high protein (HP) diets and protein supplements, yet are both fit and metabolically healthy. Here, we examine this paradox using weight pulling, a validated progressive resistance exercise training regimen, in mice fed either an LP diet or an isocaloric HP diet. We find that despite having lower food consumption than the LP group, HP-fed mice gain significantly more fat mass than LP-fed mice when not exercising, while weight pulling protected HP-fed mice from this excess fat accretion. The HP diet augmented exercise-induced hypertrophy of the forearm flexor complex, and weight pulling ability increased more rapidly in the exercised HP-fed mice. Surprisingly, exercise did not protect from HP-induced changes in glycemic control. Our results confirm that HP diets can augment muscle hypertrophy and accelerate strength gain induced by resistance exercise without negative effects on fat mass, and also demonstrate that LP diets may be advantageous in the sedentary. Our results highlight the need to consider both dietary composition and activity, not simply calories, when taking a precision nutrition approach to health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Equilibrioception is essential for the perception and navigation of mammals in the three-dimensional world. The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process in vestibular hair cells is believed to play central roles in positional and motional sensation. However, the direct equilibrioception sensor at the molecular level is not clear, and the mechanism underlying the MET process in vestibular hair cells remains elusive. Here, we identified that the G protein-coupled receptor LPHN2, which is expressed in the cuticular plate of utricular hair cells, is required for normal balance maintenance. The sensation of force by LPHN2 in the utricular hair cells increased intracellular cAMP levels in a Gs-dependent manner. The direct association of LPHN2 with the ion channel CNGA3 and increased cAMP levels enabled the activation of CNGA3, which induced calcium influx and membrane depolarization. These cellular signals and balance-related functions were significantly weakened in Lphn2&#43;/- mice, Pou4f3-CreER&#43;/- Lphn2fl/flmice and Pou4f3-CreER&#43;/-Cnga3fl/&#43; mice and could be suppressed by Gs or CNGA3 inhibitors. Collectively, our data suggested that LPHN2 could be a direct equilibrioception sensor in utricular hair cells by converting the force sensation to electrical signals through Gs and CNGA3 coupling. Both GPCR members and the ion channel CNGA3 could be essential elements for equilibrioception.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The maintenance of normal balance sensing is a fundamental prerequisite for virtually every activity of daily life. As one set most important balance information collectors, vestibular hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from head movement into electrical signals through a mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. The molecular mechanism underlying equilibrioception and MET in vestibular hair cells is not well understood but is generally believed to be mediated by ion channels. However, whether these procedures are also mediated by other receptors, such as GPCRs, which are known to govern light, odorant and taste sensing, is not known. Here, by screening the expression of force-sensitive adhesion GPCRs in vestibular hair cells and phenotype profiling in animal models, we identified that a seven-transmembrane receptor, GPR133, was able to sense force in utricle hair cells and was required for maintenance of normal equilibrioception. Notably, GPR133 converted mechanical stimuli into changes in intracellular cAMP levels through Gi engagement and then modulated plasma membrane excitability and mediated MET by coupling to CNGA3 activity changes in approximately 30% of GPR133-expressing utricle hair cells. GPR133-mediated MET and its coupling with CNGA3 were recapitulated by an in vitro reconstitution system. Further chemical labeling, mass spectrometry and cryo-EM analysis provided potential structural information on force-induced GPR133 activation and Gi3 engagement. Collectively, our findings reveal the essential role of GPR133 in the maintenance of normal equilibrioception and suggest that GPCR family members can participate in the MET process in utricle hair cells through modulation of intracellular second messenger levels and ion channel coupling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in women. Although exercise mitigates CAD, the mechanisms by which exercise impacts epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) are unknown. We hypothesized that exercise promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in EAT from female pigs. Yucatan pigs (n=7) were assigned to sedentary (Sed) or exercise (Ex) treatments and coronary arteries were occluded (O) with an ameroid to mimic CAD or remained non-occluded (N). EAT was collected for bulk and single nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq). Exercise upregulated G-protein coupled receptor, S100 family, and FAK pathways and downregulated the coagulation pathway. Exercise increased the interaction between immune, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells in the insulin-like growth factor pathway and between endothelial and other cell types in the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 pathway. Sub-clustering revealed nine cell types in EAT with fibroblast and macrophage populations predominant in O-Ex EAT and T cell population predominant in N-Ex EAT. Coronary occlusion impacted the largest number of genes in T and endothelial cells. Genes related to fatty acid metabolism were the most highly upregulated in non-immune cells from O-Ex EAT. Sub-clustering of endothelial cells revealed that N-Ex EAT separated from other treatments. In conclusion, aerobic exercise increased interaction amongst immune and mesenchymal and endothelial cells in female EAT. Exercise was minimally effective at reversing alterations in gene expression in endothelial and mesenchymal cells in EAT surrounding occluded arteries. These findings lay the foundation for future work focused on the impact of exercise on cell types in EAT.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Auditory perception enables acoustic experiences, including listening to melodious music and engaging in linguistic communication. Conversion of the force sensation into electrical signals via mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) in cochlear hair cells is the key step for auditory perception; however, the sound receptor for auditory perception at the molecular level is not clear. Here, we found that hair cell-specific deficiency of the G protein-coupled receptor LPHN2 in Pou4f3-CreER&#43;/-Lphn2fl/fl mice or pharmacological blockade of CNG ion channels in mice severely impaired hearing. Importantly, sensation of force by LPHN2 not only increased intracellular cAMP and calcium levels but also elicited rapid membrane depolarization of cochlear hair cells via Gs-dependent CNGA3 coupling. Both LPHN2 and CNGA3 were expressed at the stereocilia and cuticular plates and associated with each other. Notably, hearing loss in LPHN2-deficient mice was almost fully reversed by re-expression of LPHN2-GAIN in cochlear hair cells. Therefore, we propose that LPHN2 acts as a direct sound sensor in cochlear hair cells by mediating MET through Gs and CNGA3 coupling. Furthermore, both GPCR members and ion channels modulated by second messengers might actively participate in the MET process during auditory perception.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies.

In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies.

Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Circadian rhythms in physiology optimize organismal behavior to anticipate predictable environmental changes. Modern lifestyles can cause misalignment between {approx}24-hour rhythms in feeding behavior from daily environmental cycles. Feeding behavior is a potent behavioral zeitgeber (timekeeping cue). We determined how shifting the timing of feeding behavior impacts the alignment of {approx}24-hour rhythms in HR and cardiac electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) and Scn5a&#43;/{Delta}KPQ mice. Methods: Mice eat most of their daily calories during the dark cycle. We shifted limited their food access to the light cycle (light-cycle restricted feeding or L-RF). Telemetry was used to continuously record changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), core body temperature (Tb), and activity. Cosinor and cross correlation analyses were used to analyze rhythmicity and 24-hour alignment between variables. Results: L-RF for one day caused the 24-hour rhythms of the RR, QT, and PR intervals to shift 7-9 hours. The changes in the 24-hour ECG rhythms before and after the start of L-RF mirrored changes in daily body temperature (Tb) rhythm and correlated with changes in the high frequency (pHF) component of heart rate variability. Injecting mice undergoing L-RF with propranolol and atropine reduced the pHF component and caused a loss in the 24-hour rhythm in the RR interval and Tb. We identified a strong linear relation between the the QT interval and Tb. Normalizing the QT interval for Tb eliminated the 24-hour rhythm in the QT interval and identified abnormal changes in the QT interval in WT and Scn5a&#43;/{Delta}KPQ mice during L-RF. Conclusion: Altering the timing of daily feeding behavior reshapes 24-hour rhythms in cardiac electrophysiology in mice by modifying daily rhythms in autonomic signaling and Tb. There is a strong linear relation between the QT interval and Tb. Normalizing the QT for Tb is important for identifying QT interval prolongation independent of Tb.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Intriguingly, there is a subset of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals who are seemingly able to maintain a healthy metabolic profile free of metabolic syndrome. The molecular underpinnings of MHO, however, are not well understood. Here, we report that CTRP10/C1QL2-deficient mice represent a unique female model of MHO. CTRP10 modulates weight gain in a striking and sexually dimorphic manner. Female, but not male, mice lacking CTRP10 develop obesity with age on a low-fat diet while maintaining an otherwise healthy metabolic profile. When fed an obesogenic diet, female Ctrp10 knockout (KO) mice show rapid weight gain. Despite pronounced obesity, Ctrp10 KO female mice do not develop steatosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, or low-grade inflammation. Obesity is largely uncoupled from metabolic dysregulation in female KO mice. Multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses highlighted gene expression changes and pathways associated with insulin-sensitive obesity. Transcriptional correlation of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) orthologous in humans also show sex differences in gene connectivity within and across metabolic tissues, underscoring the conserved sex-dependent function of CTRP10. Collectively, our findings suggest that CTRP10 negatively regulates body weight in females, and that loss of CTRP10 results in benign obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This female MHO mouse model is valuable for understanding sex-biased mechanisms that uncouple obesity from metabolic dysfunction.</p>
