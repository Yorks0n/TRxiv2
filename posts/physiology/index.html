M.; Migrenne-Li, S.; Trapp, S.; Gurden, H.; Magnan, C.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555086\nGlucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.\nEffects of shoe heel height on ankle dynamics in running\nAuthors: Yawar, A.; Lieberman, D. E.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552471\nShoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.\nMuscle fibre size and myonuclear positioning in trained and aged humans\nAuthors: Battey, E.; Levy, Y.; Pollock, R. D.; Pugh, J. N.; Close, G. L.; Kalakoutis, M.; Lazarus, N. R.; Harridge, S. R.; Ochala, J.; Stroud, M. J.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.551292\nMyonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (m2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P \u003c 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Plain Language SummaryIn this study, we examined the relationship between physical activity and the characteristics of muscle fibres in individuals of different age groups. We focused on a concept called the myonuclear domain (MND), which refers to the volume surrounding muscle nuclei or myonuclei that house the genome. We wanted to understand how changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and MND size were influenced by exercise and aging. To do this, we compared muscle fibres from younger trained individuals, older trained individuals, and age-matched untrained individuals. The results showed that the average size of muscle fibres in the untrained older individuals was smaller compared to the other groups. Moreover, the number of nuclei relative to fibre size was significantly higher in the untrained older individuals. However, myonuclear arrangement was similar across all groups. These findings suggest that regular endurance exercise throughout life may help maintain muscle fibre size, myonuclear numbers, MND volumes, and myonuclear organisation in older individuals. Conversely, inactivity can lead to reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. These results have important implications for understanding the effects of exercise and aging on muscle health.\nIntermittent fasting promotes ILC3s secreting IL-22 contributing to the beigeing of white adipose tissue\nAuthors: Zhang, W.; Yin, Y.; Chen, H.; Sun, L.; Feng, L.; Han, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhai, W.; Zhang, Z.; Mulholland, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555436\nMechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.\nMyostatin is a major endocrine driver of follicle-stimulating hormone synthesis\nAuthors: Ongaro, L.; Zhou, X.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, Z.; Schultz, H.; Buddle, E. R. S.; Brule, E.; Lin, Y.-F.; Schang, G.; Castonguay, R.; Liu, Y.; Su, G. H.; Seidah, N.; Ray, K. C.; Karp, S. J.; Boehm, U.; Lee, S.-J.; Bernard, D. J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555595\nMyostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. Here, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone directly promoting pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor {beta} family, the activins. The results both challenge activin's eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. The data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to treat muscle wasting disorders may have unintended consequences on fertility.\nOptoPI3K, genetic code expansion, and click chemistry reveal mechanisms underlying reciprocal regulation between TRPV1 and PI3K\nAuthors: Koh, D.-S.; Stratiievska, A.; Jana, S.; Otto, S. C.; Swanson, T. M.; Nhim, A.; Carlson, S.; Raza, M.; Naves, L. A.; Senning, E. N.; Mehl, R.; Gordon, S. E.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555449\nReceptor tyrosine kinase signaling is characterized by complex webs of interconnected pathways that regulate diverse cellular functions. The complexity of signaling is a barrier to understanding the pathways that control any particular function. In this work, we use a novel combination of approaches and a new click chemistry probe to determine the role of one pathway in regulating cell surface expression of an ion channel and a receptor tyrosine kinase. We applied an optogenetic approach to uncouple activation of the PI3K pathway from other pathways downstream of RTK activation. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the PM in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.\nNa+/K+ATPase - Cav1.2 nanodomain differentially regulates intracellular and local adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes\nAuthors: Karbowski, M.; Boyman, L.; Garber, L.; Joca, H.; Verhoeven, N.; Coleman, A. K.; Ward, C.; Lederer, W. J.; Greiser, M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.553598\nBackground: The intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is a crucial but understudied regulator of cardiac myocyte function. The Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) controls the steady-state [Na+]i and thereby determines the set-point for intracellular Ca2+. Here, we investigate the nanoscopic organization and local adrenergic regulation of the NKA macromolecular complex and how it differentially regulates the intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ homeostases in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Methods: Multicolor STORM super-resolution microscopy, Western Blot analyses, and in vivo examination of adrenergic regulation are employed to examine the organization and function of Na+ nanodomains in cardiac myocytes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution is used in conjunction with cellular electrophysiology to investigate intracellular Na+ homeostasis in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Results: The NKA1 (NKA1) and the L-type Ca2+-channel (Cav1.2) form a nanodomain with a center-to center distance of ~65 nm in both ventricular and atrial myocytes. NKA1 protein expression levels are ~3 fold higher in atria compared to ventricle. 100% higher atrial INKA, produced by large NKA \"superclusters\", underlies the substantially lower Na+ concentration in atrial myocytes compared to the benchmark values set in ventricular myocytes. The NKA's regulatory protein phospholemman (PLM) has similar expression levels across atria and ventricle resulting in a much lower PLM/NKA1 ratio for atrial compared to ventricular tissue. In addition, a huge PLM phosphorylation reserve in atrial tissue produces a high {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity of INKA in atrial myocytes. {beta}-adrenergic regulation of INKA is locally mediated in the NKA1-Cav1.2 nanodomain via A-kinase anchoring proteins. Conclusions: NKA1, Cav1.2 and their accessory proteins form a structural and regulatory nanodomain at the cardiac dyad. The tissue-specific composition and local adrenergic regulation of this \"signaling cloud\" is a main regulator of the distinct global intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations in atrial and ventricular myocytes.\nCold-induced muscle atrophy in zebrafish: Insights from swimming activity and gene expression analysis\nAuthors: Ikeda, D.; Fujita, S.; Toda, K.; Yaginuma, Y.; Kan-no, N.; Watabe, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.553941\nThe investigation into the effects of cold acclimation on fish skeletal muscle function and its potential implications for muscle atrophy is of great interest to us. This study examines how rearing zebrafish at low temperatures affects their locomotor activity and the expression of genes associated with muscle atrophy. Zebrafish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 10 {degrees}C to 25 {degrees}C, and their swimming distance was measured. The expression levels of important muscle atrophy genes, Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were also evaluated. Our findings show that swimming activity significantly decreases when the water temperature ranges from 10 {degrees}C to 15 {degrees}C, indicating a decrease in voluntary movement. Additionally, gene expression analysis shows a significant increase in the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 at 10 {degrees}C. This up-regulation could lead to muscle atrophy caused by decreased activity in cold temperatures. To investigate the effects of exercise on reducing muscle atrophy, we subjected zebrafish to forced swimming at a temperature of 8 {degrees}C for ten days. This treatment significantly reduced the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, emphasizing the importance of muscle stimulation in preventing muscle atrophy in zebrafish. These findings suggest that zebrafish can serve as a valuable model organism for studying muscle atrophy and can be utilized in drug screening for muscle atrophy-related disorders. Cold-reared zebrafish provide a practical and ethical approach to inducing disuse muscle atrophy, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing skeletal muscle atrophy.\nWhole organ volumetric sensing Ultrasound Localization Microscopy for characterization of kidney structure\nAuthors: Chabouh, G.; Denis, L.; Bodard, S.; Lager, F.; Renault, G.; chavignon, a.; couture, o.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555780\nGlomeruli are the filtration units of the kidney and their function relies heavily on their microcirculation. Despite its obvious diagnostic importance, an accurate estimation of blood flow in the capillary bundle within glomeruli defies the resolution of conventional imaging modalities. Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has demonstrated its ability to image in-vivo deep organs in the body. Recently, the concept of sensing ULM or sULM was introduced to classify individual microbubble behavior based on the expected physiological conditions at the micrometric scale. In the kidney of both rats and humans, it revealed glomerular structures in 2D but was severely limited by planar projection. In this work, we aim to extend sULM in 3D to image the whole organ and in order to perform an accurate characterization of the entire kidney structure. The extension of sULM into the 3D domain allows better localization and more robust tracking. The 3D metrics of velocity and pathway angular shift made glomerular mask possible. This approach facilitated the quantification of glomerular physiological parameter such as an interior traveled distance of approximately 7.5 microns within the glomerulus. This study introduces a technique that characterize the complete kidney phisiology which can serve as a method to facilite pathology assessment. Furthermore, its potential for clinical relevance could serve as a bridge between research and practical application, leading to innovative diagnostics and improved patient care.\nPromoting intestinal healing by exclusive enteral nutrition with TGF-beta in a mouse model of colitis.\nAuthors: Boumessid, K.; Lacroix, V.; Ovtchinnikova, E.; Quaranta-Nicaise, M.; Roy, M.; Dumay, A.; Thenet, S.; Carriere, M.; Mas, E.; Barreau, F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555691\nBackground and aims: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the first line of treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We studied EEN nutritional composition and TGF-beta effect in a mouse model of colitis, as well as the role of intestinal microbiota. Methods: Mice were treated with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) during 5 days to induce colitis, until the inflammatory peak (day 7) or gut restitution (day 14). After DSS treatment, some of them received EEN formula such as Modulen IBD (DM mice) or Infatrini Peptisorb (DINF mice), with TGF-beta supplementation or neutralization, and clinical inflammation was evaluated. After sacrifice, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation were analyzed, as well as intestinal permeability (IP). The composition of mucosal colonic microbiota was analyzed and fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to evaluate its capacity to mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effect. Colonic crypts from DSS and EEN mice were cultured as 3D organoids and cellular properties were analyzed. Results: DSS mice developed colitis, as evidenced by the weight loss and clinical inflammation. It was accompanied by macroscopic inflammation such as colon thickness and edemas, and an elevated IP. In contrast, EEN mice with TGF-beta formula present faster weight recovery and decreased inflammatory parameters, with a normalized IP, suggesting gut restitution and functionality. These functional improvements were not obtained for EEN mice without TGF-beta formula. Moreover, EEN with Modulen IBD (DM mice) modified the microbiota in comparison to DSS condition and attenuated inflammation. In addition, the organoids from DM mice colonic crypts treated had an enhanced survival, and re-epithelialization capacity. Conclusions: Both EEN formula have anti-inflammatory properties, certainly by the nutritional composition. However, TGF-beta plays a significant role in intestinal restitution and restoring barrier function. These beneficial effects are partly mediated by the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (m2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes.

Plain Language SummaryIn this study, we examined the relationship between physical activity and the characteristics of muscle fibres in individuals of different age groups. We focused on a concept called the myonuclear domain (MND), which refers to the volume surrounding muscle nuclei or myonuclei that house the genome. We wanted to understand how changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and MND size were influenced by exercise and aging. To do this, we compared muscle fibres from younger trained individuals, older trained individuals, and age-matched untrained individuals. The results showed that the average size of muscle fibres in the untrained older individuals was smaller compared to the other groups. Moreover, the number of nuclei relative to fibre size was significantly higher in the untrained older individuals. However, myonuclear arrangement was similar across all groups. These findings suggest that regular endurance exercise throughout life may help maintain muscle fibre size, myonuclear numbers, MND volumes, and myonuclear organisation in older individuals. Conversely, inactivity can lead to reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. These results have important implications for understanding the effects of exercise and aging on muscle health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. Here, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone directly promoting pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor {beta} family, the activins. The results both challenge activin&#39;s eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. The data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to treat muscle wasting disorders may have unintended consequences on fertility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is characterized by complex webs of interconnected pathways that regulate diverse cellular functions. The complexity of signaling is a barrier to understanding the pathways that control any particular function. In this work, we use a novel combination of approaches and a new click chemistry probe to determine the role of one pathway in regulating cell surface expression of an ion channel and a receptor tyrosine kinase. We applied an optogenetic approach to uncouple activation of the PI3K pathway from other pathways downstream of RTK activation. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the PM in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The intracellular Na&#43; concentration ([Na&#43;]i) is a crucial but understudied regulator of cardiac myocyte function. The Na&#43;/K&#43; ATPase (NKA) controls the steady-state [Na&#43;]i and thereby determines the set-point for intracellular Ca2&#43;. Here, we investigate the nanoscopic organization and local adrenergic regulation of the NKA macromolecular complex and how it differentially regulates the intracellular Na&#43; and Ca2&#43; homeostases in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Methods: Multicolor STORM super-resolution microscopy, Western Blot analyses, and in vivo examination of adrenergic regulation are employed to examine the organization and function of Na&#43; nanodomains in cardiac myocytes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution is used in conjunction with cellular electrophysiology to investigate intracellular Na&#43; homeostasis in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Results: The NKA1 (NKA1) and the L-type Ca2&#43;-channel (Cav1.2) form a nanodomain with a center-to center distance of ~65 nm in both ventricular and atrial myocytes. NKA1 protein expression levels are ~3 fold higher in atria compared to ventricle. 100% higher atrial INKA, produced by large NKA &#34;superclusters&#34;, underlies the substantially lower Na&#43; concentration in atrial myocytes compared to the benchmark values set in ventricular myocytes. The NKA&#39;s regulatory protein phospholemman (PLM) has similar expression levels across atria and ventricle resulting in a much lower PLM/NKA1 ratio for atrial compared to ventricular tissue. In addition, a huge PLM phosphorylation reserve in atrial tissue produces a high {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity of INKA in atrial myocytes. {beta}-adrenergic regulation of INKA is locally mediated in the NKA1-Cav1.2 nanodomain via A-kinase anchoring proteins. Conclusions: NKA1, Cav1.2 and their accessory proteins form a structural and regulatory nanodomain at the cardiac dyad. The tissue-specific composition and local adrenergic regulation of this &#34;signaling cloud&#34; is a main regulator of the distinct global intracellular Na&#43; and Ca2&#43; concentrations in atrial and ventricular myocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The investigation into the effects of cold acclimation on fish skeletal muscle function and its potential implications for muscle atrophy is of great interest to us. This study examines how rearing zebrafish at low temperatures affects their locomotor activity and the expression of genes associated with muscle atrophy. Zebrafish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 10 {degrees}C to 25 {degrees}C, and their swimming distance was measured. The expression levels of important muscle atrophy genes, Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were also evaluated. Our findings show that swimming activity significantly decreases when the water temperature ranges from 10 {degrees}C to 15 {degrees}C, indicating a decrease in voluntary movement. Additionally, gene expression analysis shows a significant increase in the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 at 10 {degrees}C. This up-regulation could lead to muscle atrophy caused by decreased activity in cold temperatures. To investigate the effects of exercise on reducing muscle atrophy, we subjected zebrafish to forced swimming at a temperature of 8 {degrees}C for ten days. This treatment significantly reduced the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, emphasizing the importance of muscle stimulation in preventing muscle atrophy in zebrafish. These findings suggest that zebrafish can serve as a valuable model organism for studying muscle atrophy and can be utilized in drug screening for muscle atrophy-related disorders. Cold-reared zebrafish provide a practical and ethical approach to inducing disuse muscle atrophy, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing skeletal muscle atrophy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glomeruli are the filtration units of the kidney and their function relies heavily on their microcirculation. Despite its obvious diagnostic importance, an accurate estimation of blood flow in the capillary bundle within glomeruli defies the resolution of conventional imaging modalities. Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has demonstrated its ability to image in-vivo deep organs in the body. Recently, the concept of sensing ULM or sULM was introduced to classify individual microbubble behavior based on the expected physiological conditions at the micrometric scale. In the kidney of both rats and humans, it revealed glomerular structures in 2D but was severely limited by planar projection. In this work, we aim to extend sULM in 3D to image the whole organ and in order to perform an accurate characterization of the entire kidney structure. The extension of sULM into the 3D domain allows better localization and more robust tracking. The 3D metrics of velocity and pathway angular shift made glomerular mask possible. This approach facilitated the quantification of glomerular physiological parameter such as an interior traveled distance of approximately 7.5 microns within the glomerulus. This study introduces a technique that characterize the complete kidney phisiology which can serve as a method to facilite pathology assessment. Furthermore, its potential for clinical relevance could serve as a bridge between research and practical application, leading to innovative diagnostics and improved patient care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aims: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the first line of treatment for pediatric Crohn&#39;s disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We studied EEN nutritional composition and TGF-beta effect in a mouse model of colitis, as well as the role of intestinal microbiota. Methods: Mice were treated with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) during 5 days to induce colitis, until the inflammatory peak (day 7) or gut restitution (day 14). After DSS treatment, some of them received EEN formula such as Modulen IBD (DM mice) or Infatrini Peptisorb (DINF mice), with TGF-beta supplementation or neutralization, and clinical inflammation was evaluated. After sacrifice, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation were analyzed, as well as intestinal permeability (IP). The composition of mucosal colonic microbiota was analyzed and fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to evaluate its capacity to mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effect. Colonic crypts from DSS and EEN mice were cultured as 3D organoids and cellular properties were analyzed. Results: DSS mice developed colitis, as evidenced by the weight loss and clinical inflammation. It was accompanied by macroscopic inflammation such as colon thickness and edemas, and an elevated IP. In contrast, EEN mice with TGF-beta formula present faster weight recovery and decreased inflammatory parameters, with a normalized IP, suggesting gut restitution and functionality. These functional improvements were not obtained for EEN mice without TGF-beta formula. Moreover, EEN with Modulen IBD (DM mice) modified the microbiota in comparison to DSS condition and attenuated inflammation. In addition, the organoids from DM mice colonic crypts treated had an enhanced survival, and re-epithelialization capacity. Conclusions: Both EEN formula have anti-inflammatory properties, certainly by the nutritional composition. However, TGF-beta plays a significant role in intestinal restitution and restoring barrier function. These beneficial effects are partly mediated by the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis.</p>
