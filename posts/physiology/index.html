D.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552481\nObesity-induced inflammation causes metabolic dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the innate immune transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) adversely affects glucose homeostasis through induction of the endogenous FAHFA hydrolase androgen induced gene 1 (AIG1) in adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of IRF3 protects mice against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of IRF3 or AIG1 in adipocytes promotes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AIG1 reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance and restored glucose homeostasis in the setting of adipocyte IRF3 overexpression. We, therefore, identify the adipocyte IRF3/AIG1 axis as a crucial link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and suggest an approach for limiting the metabolic dysfunction accompanying obesity.\nDirect photoreception of a pituitary endocrine cell, melanotroph, induces a hormone release\nAuthors: Fukuda, A.; Sato, K.; Fujimori, C.; Yamashita, T.; Takeuchi, A.; Ohuchi, H.; Umatani, C.; Kanda, S.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551597\nIn addition to canonical photoreception by the eye, many other organs express non-visual photoreceptors although their biological significance is mostly unknown. Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2+]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection. One-Sentence SummaryAn endocrine cell of the pituitary was proven to be a photoreceptive cell that enables autonomous hormone release.\nTGF-β Ligand Cross-Subfamily Interactions in the Response of Caenorhabditis elegans to Bacterial Pathogens\nAuthors: Ciccarelli, E. J.; Wing, Z.; Bendelstein, M.; Johal, R. K.; Singh, G.; Monas, A.; Savage-Dunn, C.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.05.539606\nThe Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-{beta}) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that are synergistic, cooperative, additive, and/or antagonistic. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-{beta} ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-{beta} ligands play a role in the immune response. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-{beta} ligands act cooperatively as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands - DBL-1 and TIG-2 - function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-{beta}/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function cooperatively. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-{beta}/Activin signaling pathway do not play a role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamily ligands to interact, and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.\nThe black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis detects CO2 without the Haller's organ\nAuthors: Städele, C.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551779\nBoth male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animals state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Hallers organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Hallers organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.\nRapid, high-throughput phenotypic profiling of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) using benchtop flow cytometry\nAuthors: Anthony, C. J.; Lock, C. C.; Bentlage, B.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.06.519248\nEndosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary producer of energy for many cnidarians, including corals. The intricate coral-dinoflagellate symbiotic relationship is becoming increasingly important under climate change, as its breakdown leads to mass coral bleaching and often mortality. Despite methodological progress, assessing the phenotypic traits of Symbiodiniaceae in-hospite remains a complex task. Bio-optics, biochemistry, or \"-omics\" techniques are expensive, often inaccessible to investigators, or lack the resolution required to understand single-cell phenotypic states within endosymbiotic dinoflagellate assemblages. To help address this issue, we developed a protocol that collects information on cell autofluorescence, shape, and size to simultaneously generate phenotypic profiles for thousands of Symbiodiniaceae cells, thus revealing phenotypic variance of the Symbiodiniaceae assemblage to the resolution of single cells. As flow cytometry is adopted as a robust and efficient method for cell counting, integration of our protocol into existing workflows allows researchers to acquire a new level of resolution for studies examining the acclimation and adaptation strategies of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages.\nPathogenic entero- and salivatypes harbour changes in microbiome virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes with increasing chronic liver disease severity\nAuthors: Lee, S.; Arefaine, B.; Begum, N.; Stamouli, M.; Witherden, E.; Mohamad, M.; Harzandi, A.; Zamalloa, A.; Cai, H.; Edwards, L. A.; Williams, R.; Chokshi, S.; Mardinoglu, A.; Proctor, G.; Shawcross, D. L.; Moyes, D.; Uhlen, M.; Shoaie, S.; Patel, V. C.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552152\nBackground \u0026 AimsLife-threatening complications of cirrhosis are triggered by bacterial infections, with the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Alterations in the gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are recognised to influence clinical outcomes, whilst the role of the oral microbiome is still being explored. Our aims were to simultaneously interrogate the gut and oral micro- and mycobiome in cirrhotic patients, and assess microbial community structure overlap in relation to clinical outcomes, as well as alterations in virulence factors and AMR genes. Methods18 healthy controls (HC), 20 stable cirrhotics (SC), 50 DC, 18 ACLF and 15 with non-liver sepsis (NLS) i.e. severe infection but without cirrhosis, were recruited at a tertiary liver centre. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was undertaken from saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples (paired where possible). Salivatypes and enterotypes based on clustering of genera were calculated and compared in relation to cirrhosis severity and in relation to specific clinical parameters. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated in both oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified. ResultsSpecific saliva- and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity, and in those with hyperammonemia. Overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed and was significantly higher in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant use. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other virulence factors in patients with DC and ACLF. Substantial numbers of ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected with 575 ARGs common to both sites. The cirrhosis resistome was significantly different to HCs, with three and four resistotypes identified for the oral and gut microbiome, respectively. DiscussionOral and gut microbiome profiles differ significantly with increasing severity of cirrhosis, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. DC and ACLF have significantly worse microbial diversity than NLS, despite similar antimicrobial exposure, supporting the additive patho-biological effect of cirrhosis. The degree of microbial community overlap between sites, frequency of virulence factors and presence of ARGs, all increment significantly with hepatic decompensation. These alterations may predispose to higher infection risk, poorer response to antimicrobial therapy and worsening outcomes, and provide the rationale for developing non-antibiotic-dependent microbiome-modulating therapies.\nCentral and peripheral clocks synergistically enhance circadian robustness, flexibility and performance of cardiac pacemaking\nAuthors: Li, P.; Kim, J. K.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552251\nThe strong circadian ([~]24h) rhythms in heart rate (HR) are critical for flexible regulation of cardiac pacemaking function throughout the day. While this circadian flexibility in HR is robustly sustained in diverse conditions, it declines as the heart ages, accompanied by reduced maximal HR performance. The intricate regulation of circadian HR patterns involves the orchestration of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities (SNA and PNA) alongside local circadian rhythmicity (LCR) within the heart. However, their intricate interactions that sustain the resilience and adaptability of circadian rhythms, as well as the mechanisms that underpin their deterioration during the aging process, remain enigmatic. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model describing autonomic control and LCR in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) that accurately captures distinct circadian patterns in adult and aged mice. Our model underscores the indispensable synergy among SNA, PNA, and LCR in preserving circadian flexibility, robustness, and performance in SANC. SNA predominantly enhances SANC robustness and performance, while PNA primarily drives SANC flexibility, complemented by LCR and SNA. LCR acts as a booster, further enhancing SANC flexibility and performance. However, the delicate balance of this synergy is disrupted with age, resulting in diminished SANC performance and flexibility. Specifically, age-related impairment of PNA selectively dampens SANC flexibility while ion channel remodeling disrupts all SANC functions. Our work shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction, which may help to identify potential therapeutic targets within the circadian clock for the prevention and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Author SummaryThe mammalian heart relies on the sinoatrial node, known as the cardiac pacemaker, to orchestrate heartbeats. These heartbeats slow down during sleep and accelerate upon waking, in anticipation of daily environmental changes. The hearts ability to rhythmically adapt to these 24-hour changes, known as circadian rhythms, is crucial for flexible cardiac performance throughout the day, accommodating various physiological states. However, with aging, the hearts circadian flexibility gradually weakens, accompanied by a decline in maximal heart rate. Previous studies have implicated the involvement of a master circadian clock and a local circadian clock within the heart, but their time-of-day interactions and altered dynamics during aging remain unclear. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the regulation of sinoatrial nodal cell pacemaking function by the master and local circadian clocks in adult and aged mice. Our results revealed distinct roles played by these clocks in determining circadian patterns of sinoatrial nodal cells and shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction.\nAblation of carotid body activity reverses diabesity by improving white and brown adipose tissue sympathetic innervation and metabolism\nAuthors: Melo, B.

V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552063\nFinding novel pathological mechanisms that lead to innovative strategies to treat obesity and its associated illness are critically needed. The carotid bodies (CB) are metabolic sensors whose dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance development. Herein, we find that the ablation of CB activity, through resection of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) promotes weight loss and restores metabolic function in high fat (HF) rodents, by increasing WAT basal metabolism and by restoring WAT and BAT sympathetic activation. Moreover, we found that CSN resection rescues adipose tissue sympathetic/catecholamine resistance present in obesity states. Additionally, we found that the CB signals integrated in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are decreased in obesity states and that CSN denervation in HF animals restore neuronal activity in this region. By inducing energy expenditure via the increase in WAT and BAT metabolism, CB modulation might be used as a therapeutic target for obesity and dysmetabolism.

R.; Johnson, L. A.; Graf, G. A.; Gordon, S. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.551670\nBackgroundInflammatory cells within atherosclerotic lesions secrete various proteolytic enzymes that contribute to lesion progression and destabilization, increasing the risk for an acute cardiovascular event. The relative contributions of specific proteases to atherogenesis is not well understood. Elastase is a serine protease, secreted by macrophages and neutrophils, that may contribute to the development of unstable plaque. We have previously reported interaction of endogenous protease-inhibitor proteins with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), including alpha-1-antitrypsin, an inhibitor of elastase. These findings support a potential role for HDL as an endogenous modulator of protease activity. In this study, we test the hypothesis that enhancement of HDL-associated elastase inhibitor activity is protective against atherosclerotic lesion progression. MethodsWe designed an HDL-targeting protease inhibitor (HTPI) that binds to HDL and confers elastase inhibitor activity. Lipoprotein binding and the impact of HTPI on atherosclerosis was examined using mouse models. ResultsHTPI is a small (1.6 kDa) peptide with an elastase inhibitor domain, a soluble linker, and an HDL-targeting domain. When incubated with human plasma ex vivo, HTPI predominantly binds to HDL. Intravenous administration of HTPI to mice resulted in its binding to plasma HDL and increased elastase inhibitor activity on isolated HDL. Accumulation of HTPI within plaque was observed after systemic administration to Apoe-/- mice. To examine the effect of HTPI treatment on atherosclerosis, prevention and progression studies were performed using Ldlr-/- mice fed Western diet. In both study designs, HTPI-treated mice had reduced lipid deposition in plaque. Histology and immunofluorescence staining of aortic root sections were used to examine the impact of HTPI on lesion morphology and inflammatory features. ConclusionsThese data support the hypothesis that HDL-associated anti-elastase activity can improve the atheroprotective potential of HDL and highlight the potential utility of HDL enrichment with anti-protease activity as an approach for stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions.\nEffects of shoe heel height on ankle dynamics in running\nAuthors: Yawar, A.; Lieberman, D. E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552471\nShoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 -- 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Obesity-induced inflammation causes metabolic dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the innate immune transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) adversely affects glucose homeostasis through induction of the endogenous FAHFA hydrolase androgen induced gene 1 (AIG1) in adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of IRF3 protects mice against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of IRF3 or AIG1 in adipocytes promotes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AIG1 reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance and restored glucose homeostasis in the setting of adipocyte IRF3 overexpression. We, therefore, identify the adipocyte IRF3/AIG1 axis as a crucial link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and suggest an approach for limiting the metabolic dysfunction accompanying obesity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In addition to canonical photoreception by the eye, many other organs express non-visual photoreceptors although their biological significance is mostly unknown. Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2&#43; imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2&#43;]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection.

One-Sentence SummaryAn endocrine cell of the pituitary was proven to be a photoreceptive cell that enables autonomous hormone release.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-{beta}) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that are synergistic, cooperative, additive, and/or antagonistic. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-{beta} ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-{beta} ligands play a role in the immune response. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-{beta} ligands act cooperatively as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands - DBL-1 and TIG-2 - function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-{beta}/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function cooperatively. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-{beta}/Activin signaling pathway do not play a role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamily ligands to interact, and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Both male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animals state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Hallers organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Hallers organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary producer of energy for many cnidarians, including corals. The intricate coral-dinoflagellate symbiotic relationship is becoming increasingly important under climate change, as its breakdown leads to mass coral bleaching and often mortality. Despite methodological progress, assessing the phenotypic traits of Symbiodiniaceae in-hospite remains a complex task. Bio-optics, biochemistry, or &#34;-omics&#34; techniques are expensive, often inaccessible to investigators, or lack the resolution required to understand single-cell phenotypic states within endosymbiotic dinoflagellate assemblages. To help address this issue, we developed a protocol that collects information on cell autofluorescence, shape, and size to simultaneously generate phenotypic profiles for thousands of Symbiodiniaceae cells, thus revealing phenotypic variance of the Symbiodiniaceae assemblage to the resolution of single cells. As flow cytometry is adopted as a robust and efficient method for cell counting, integration of our protocol into existing workflows allows researchers to acquire a new level of resolution for studies examining the acclimation and adaptation strategies of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; AimsLife-threatening complications of cirrhosis are triggered by bacterial infections, with the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Alterations in the gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are recognised to influence clinical outcomes, whilst the role of the oral microbiome is still being explored. Our aims were to simultaneously interrogate the gut and oral micro- and mycobiome in cirrhotic patients, and assess microbial community structure overlap in relation to clinical outcomes, as well as alterations in virulence factors and AMR genes.

Methods18 healthy controls (HC), 20 stable cirrhotics (SC), 50 DC, 18 ACLF and 15 with non-liver sepsis (NLS) i.e. severe infection but without cirrhosis, were recruited at a tertiary liver centre. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was undertaken from saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples (paired where possible).  Salivatypes and  enterotypes based on clustering of genera were calculated and compared in relation to cirrhosis severity and in relation to specific clinical parameters. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated in both oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified.

ResultsSpecific saliva- and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity, and in those with hyperammonemia. Overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed and was significantly higher in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant use. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other virulence factors in patients with DC and ACLF. Substantial numbers of ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected with 575 ARGs common to both sites. The cirrhosis resistome was significantly different to HCs, with three and four resistotypes identified for the oral and gut microbiome, respectively.

DiscussionOral and gut microbiome profiles differ significantly with increasing severity of cirrhosis, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. DC and ACLF have significantly worse microbial diversity than NLS, despite similar antimicrobial exposure, supporting the additive patho-biological effect of cirrhosis. The degree of microbial community overlap between sites, frequency of virulence factors and presence of ARGs, all increment significantly with hepatic decompensation. These alterations may predispose to higher infection risk, poorer response to antimicrobial therapy and worsening outcomes, and provide the rationale for developing non-antibiotic-dependent microbiome-modulating therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The strong circadian ([~]24h) rhythms in heart rate (HR) are critical for flexible regulation of cardiac pacemaking function throughout the day. While this circadian flexibility in HR is robustly sustained in diverse conditions, it declines as the heart ages, accompanied by reduced maximal HR performance. The intricate regulation of circadian HR patterns involves the orchestration of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities (SNA and PNA) alongside local circadian rhythmicity (LCR) within the heart. However, their intricate interactions that sustain the resilience and adaptability of circadian rhythms, as well as the mechanisms that underpin their deterioration during the aging process, remain enigmatic. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model describing autonomic control and LCR in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) that accurately captures distinct circadian patterns in adult and aged mice. Our model underscores the indispensable synergy among SNA, PNA, and LCR in preserving circadian flexibility, robustness, and performance in SANC. SNA predominantly enhances SANC robustness and performance, while PNA primarily drives SANC flexibility, complemented by LCR and SNA. LCR acts as a booster, further enhancing SANC flexibility and performance. However, the delicate balance of this synergy is disrupted with age, resulting in diminished SANC performance and flexibility. Specifically, age-related impairment of PNA selectively dampens SANC flexibility while ion channel remodeling disrupts all SANC functions. Our work shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction, which may help to identify potential therapeutic targets within the circadian clock for the prevention and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

Author SummaryThe mammalian heart relies on the sinoatrial node, known as the cardiac pacemaker, to orchestrate heartbeats. These heartbeats slow down during sleep and accelerate upon waking, in anticipation of daily environmental changes. The hearts ability to rhythmically adapt to these 24-hour changes, known as circadian rhythms, is crucial for flexible cardiac performance throughout the day, accommodating various physiological states. However, with aging, the hearts circadian flexibility gradually weakens, accompanied by a decline in maximal heart rate. Previous studies have implicated the involvement of a master circadian clock and a local circadian clock within the heart, but their time-of-day interactions and altered dynamics during aging remain unclear. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the regulation of sinoatrial nodal cell pacemaking function by the master and local circadian clocks in adult and aged mice. Our results revealed distinct roles played by these clocks in determining circadian patterns of sinoatrial nodal cells and shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Finding novel pathological mechanisms that lead to innovative strategies to treat obesity and its associated illness are critically needed. The carotid bodies (CB) are metabolic sensors whose dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance development. Herein, we find that the ablation of CB activity, through resection of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) promotes weight loss and restores metabolic function in high fat (HF) rodents, by increasing WAT basal metabolism and by restoring WAT and BAT sympathetic activation. Moreover, we found that CSN resection rescues adipose tissue sympathetic/catecholamine resistance present in obesity states. Additionally, we found that the CB signals integrated in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are decreased in obesity states and that CSN denervation in HF animals restore neuronal activity in this region. By inducing energy expenditure via the increase in WAT and BAT metabolism, CB modulation might be used as a therapeutic target for obesity and dysmetabolism.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInflammatory cells within atherosclerotic lesions secrete various proteolytic enzymes that contribute to lesion progression and destabilization, increasing the risk for an acute cardiovascular event. The relative contributions of specific proteases to atherogenesis is not well understood. Elastase is a serine protease, secreted by macrophages and neutrophils, that may contribute to the development of unstable plaque. We have previously reported interaction of endogenous protease-inhibitor proteins with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), including alpha-1-antitrypsin, an inhibitor of elastase. These findings support a potential role for HDL as an endogenous modulator of protease activity. In this study, we test the hypothesis that enhancement of HDL-associated elastase inhibitor activity is protective against atherosclerotic lesion progression.

MethodsWe designed an HDL-targeting protease inhibitor (HTPI) that binds to HDL and confers elastase inhibitor activity. Lipoprotein binding and the impact of HTPI on atherosclerosis was examined using mouse models.

ResultsHTPI is a small (1.6 kDa) peptide with an elastase inhibitor domain, a soluble linker, and an HDL-targeting domain. When incubated with human plasma ex vivo, HTPI predominantly binds to HDL. Intravenous administration of HTPI to mice resulted in its binding to plasma HDL and increased elastase inhibitor activity on isolated HDL. Accumulation of HTPI within plaque was observed after systemic administration to Apoe-/- mice. To examine the effect of HTPI treatment on atherosclerosis, prevention and progression studies were performed using Ldlr-/- mice fed Western diet. In both study designs, HTPI-treated mice had reduced lipid deposition in plaque. Histology and immunofluorescence staining of aortic root sections were used to examine the impact of HTPI on lesion morphology and inflammatory features.

ConclusionsThese data support the hypothesis that HDL-associated anti-elastase activity can improve the atheroprotective potential of HDL and highlight the potential utility of HDL enrichment with anti-protease activity as an approach for stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 -- 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.</p>
