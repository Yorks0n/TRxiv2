D.\nScore: 47.2, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nMetabolic transitions regulate global protein fatty acylation\nAuthors: Talwadekar, M.; Khatri, S.; Balaji, C.; Chakraborty, A.; Basak, N.-P.; Kamat, S.; Kolthur-Seetharam, U.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545712\nIntermediary metabolites and flux through various pathways have emerged as key determinants of post-translational modifications. Independently, dynamic fluctuations in their concentrations are known to drive cellular energetics in a bi-directional manner. Notably, intracellular fatty acid pools that drastically change during fed and fasted states act as precursors for both ATP production and fatty acylation of proteins. Protein fatty acylation is well regarded for its role in regulating structure and functions of diverse proteins, however the effect of intracellular concentrations of fatty acids on protein modification is less understood. In this regard, we unequivocally demonstrate that metabolic contexts, viz. fed and fasted states, dictate the extent of global fatty acylation. Moreover, we show that presence or absence of glucose, that influences cellular and mitochondrial uptake/utilization of fatty acids, affects palmitoylation and oleoylation, which is consistent with their intracellular abundance in fed and fasted states. Employing complementary approaches including click-chemistry, lipidomics and imaging, we show the top-down control of cellular metabolic state. Importantly, our results establish the crucial role of mitochondria and retrograde signaling components like SIRT4, AMPK and mTOR in orchestrating protein fatty acylation at a whole cell level. Specifically, pharmacogenetic perturbations that alter either mitochondrial functions and/or retrograde signaling affect protein fatty acylation. Besides illustrating the cross-talk between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mediating bulk post-translational modification, our findings also highlight the involvement of mitochondrial energetics.\nThe MODY-associated TALK-1 L114P mutation causes islet α-cell overactivity and β-cell inactivity resulting in transient neonatal diabetes and glucose dyshomeostasis in adults\nAuthors: Nakhe, A. Y.; Dadi, P. K.; Kim, J.; Shrestha, S.; Cartailler, J.-P.; Sampson, L.; Magnuson, M. A.; Jacobson, D. A.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545631\nA strong association of the gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K+ channel (p.L114P) with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was recently reported in two distinct families. TALK-1 is a key regulator of {beta}-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). KCNK16, the gene that encodes TALK-1, is the most abundant and {beta}-cell-restricted K+ channel transcript and KCNK16 locus is strongly associated to type-2 diabetes. To investigate the impact of TALK-1-L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the Kcnk16 L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous Kcnk16 L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1(ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous Kcnk16 L114P neonates due to lack of GSIS and can be reduced with insulin treatment. TALK-1-L114P drastically increases whole-cell {beta}-cell K+ currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca2+ entry and a complete loss of glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Thus, adult Kcnk16 L114P mice have reduced GSIS and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated TALK-1-L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by altering islet hormone secretion during development. These data strongly suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.\nPharmacological or genetic inhibition of Scn9a protects beta-cells while reducing insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes\nAuthors: Overby, P.; Provenzano, S.; Nahirney, N. S.; Dai, X.-Q.; Sun, W. G.; Xia, Y.; Kolic, J.; Macdonald, P. E.; Johnson, J. D.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.11.544521\nPancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na+ channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na+ channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na+ channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na+ currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na+ currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice and the effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the sole target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.\nMarked irregular myofiber shape is a hallmark of human skeletal muscle aging and is reversed by heavy resistance training\nAuthors: Soendenbroe, C.; Karlsen, A.; Svensson, R. B.; Kjaer, M.; Andersen, J. L.; Mackey, A. L.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543651\nBackgroundAge-related loss of strength is disproportionally greater than the loss of mass, suggesting maladaptations in the neuro-myo-tendinous system. Myofibers are often misshaped in aged and diseased muscle, but systematic analyses of large sample sets are lacking. Our aim was to investigate myofiber shape in relation to age, exercise, myofiber type, species, and sex. MethodsPreviously collected vastus lateralis muscle biopsies (n=265) from 197 males and females, covering an age-span of 20 to 97 years, were examined. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of 7 C57BL/6 mice were also examined. Immunofluorescence and ATPase stainings of muscle cross-sections were used to measure myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and perimeter, from which a shape factor index (SFI) was calculated in a fiber type specific manner (type I and II in humans; type I, IIa, IIx and IIb in mice). Heavy resistance training (RT) was performed 3 times per week for 3-4 months by a subgroup (n=59). Correlation analyses were performed comparing SFI and CSA with age, muscle mass, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), rate of force development (RFD), and specific force (MVC/muscle mass). ResultsIn human muscle, SFI was positively correlated with age for both type I (R2=0.20) and type II (R2=0.38) myofibers. When subjects were separated into age cohorts, SFI was lower for type I (p\u003c0.001) and II (p\u003c0.001) myofibers in Young (20-36) compared to Old (60-80), and higher for type I (p\u003c0.05) and II (p\u003c0.001) myofibers in the Oldest Old (\u003e80) compared to Old. The increased SFI in old muscle was observed in myofibers of all sizes. Within all three age cohorts, type II myofibers SFI was higher than for type I myofibers (p\u003c0.001), which was also the case in mice muscles (p\u003c0.001). Across age cohorts, there was no difference between males and females in SFI for either type I (p=0.496/0.734) or II (p=0.176/0.585) myofibers. Multiple linear regression revealed that SFI, after adjusting for age and myofiber CSA, has independent explanatory power for 8 out of 10 indices of muscle mass and function. RT reduced SFI of type II myofibers in both Young and Old (p\u003c0.001). ConclusionsHere, we identify type I and II myofiber shape in humans and mice as a hallmark of muscle ageing, that independently predicts volumetric and functional assessments of muscle health. RT reverts the shape of type II myofibers, indicating that lack of neuromuscular activation might lead to myofiber deformity.\nNo sex differences in oxygen uptake or extraction kinetics in the moderate or heavy exercise intensity domains\nAuthors: Solleiro Pons, M.; Bernert, L.; Hume, E.; Hughes, L.; Williams, Z.; Burnley, M.; Ansdell, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546455\nThe integrative response to exercise differs between sexes, with oxidative energy provision purported as a potential mechanism. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the kinetics of oxygen uptake ([Formula]O2) and extraction (HHb+Mb) during exercise in both sexes. Sixteen young adults (8 females, age: 27{+/-}5 years) completed three experimental visits. Incremental exercise testing was performed to obtain lactate threshold and [Formula]O2peak. Subsequent visits involved three six-minute cycling bouts at 80% of lactate threshold and one 30-minute bout at a work rate 30% between the lactate threshold and maximal ramp test power. Pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy continuously sampled [Formula]O2 and HHb+Mb, respectively. The mean of six moderate and two heavy intensity transitions were modelled with mono-exponential curves to quantify the phase II response to exercise. Slow component amplitudes were also quantified for the heavy intensity domain. Males and females demonstrated similar relative [Formula]O2peak values (46.2{+/-}6.6 vs 40.5{+/-}6.7 ml.kg- 1.min-1, p=0.111), with males achieving [~]30% greater power outputs (p=0.002). In both the moderate and heavy intensity domains, the relative amplitude of the phase II transition was similar between sexes for [Formula]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.179) and HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.193). Similarly, there were no sex differences in the time constants for [Formula]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.385) or HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.274). In the heavy intensity domain, neither [Formula]O2 (p[\u0026ge;]0.686) or HHb+Mb (p[\u0026ge;]0.432) slow component amplitudes were different between sexes. The oxidative response to moderate and heavy intensity exercise did not differ between males and females, suggesting both sexes experience similar degrees of bioenergetic stress during intensity-matched exercise. New and NoteworthyThis study demonstrated no sex differences in the bioenergetic response to moderate and heavy intensity cycling exercise. The change in oxygen uptake and deoxyhaemoglobin were modelled with mono-exponential curve fitting, which revealed that both sexes increased the rate of oxidative energy provision similarly. This provides insight into previously reported sex differences (e.g., fatigability) suggesting that the mechanisms are contractile rather than metabolic.\nThe formation of KV2.1 macro-clusters is required for sex-specific differences in L-type CaV1.2 clustering and function in arterial myocytes\nAuthors: Matsumoto, C.; O'Dwyer, S. C.; Manning, D.; Hernandez-Hernandez, G.; Rhana, P.; Fong, Z.; Sato, D.; Clancy, C. E.; Vierra, N. C.; Trimmer, J. S.; Santana, L. F.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546725\nIn arterial myocytes, the canonical function of voltage-gated CaV1.2 and KV2.1 channels is to induce myocyte contraction and relaxation through their responses to membrane depolarization, respectively. Paradoxically, KV2.1 also plays a sex-specific role by promoting the clustering and activity of CaV1.2 channels. However, the impact of KV2.1 protein organization on CaV1.2 function remains poorly understood. We discovered that KV2.1 forms micro-clusters, which can transform into large macro-clusters when a critical clustering site (S590) in the channel is phosphorylated in arterial myocytes. Notably, female myocytes exhibit greater phosphorylation of S590, and macro-cluster formation compared to males. Contrary to current models, the activity of KV2.1 channels seems unrelated to density or macro-clustering in arterial myocytes. Disrupting the KV2.1 clustering site (KV2.1S590A) eliminated KV2.1 macro-clustering and sex-specific differences in CaV1.2 cluster size and activity. We propose that the degree of KV2.1 clustering tunes CaV1.2 channel function in a sex-specific manner in arterial myocytes.\nGDF15 is a Critical Renostat in the Defense Against Hypoglycemia\nAuthors: Li, Z.; Zhang, X.; Zhu, W.; Xu, Q.; Yu, C.; Zhao, Q.; Siebel, S.; Zhang, C.; Costa Lima, B. G.; Li, X.; Israni-Winger, K.; Nasiri, A. R.; Caplan, M. J.; Chang, R. B.; Wang, A.; Belfort de Aguiar, R.; Hwang, J. J.; Perry, R. J.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546095\nEpisodic hypoglycemia is one of the best honed, evolutionary conserved phenomena in biology, because of the constant feast-fast cycles that have characterized most of history. The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, mobilizing substrate stores to produce glucose, is the primary adaptive mechanism to enable survival. Catecholamines and glucagon have long been considered the key hypoglycemia counterregulatory hormones, but here we identify a new hypoglycemia counterregulatory factor. We employed the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp to mimic the two common settings in which hypoglycemia can occur in patients: postprandial insulin overdose and elevated basal insulin administration, respectively. We found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) production is induced in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubules and its release increases hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing intrahepatic lipolysis in a beta-adrenergic receptor-2 (Adrb2)-dependent manner. In addition, mice exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia and patients with T1D exhibit impaired GDF15 production in the setting of hypoglycemia. These data demonstrate that GDF15 acts acutely as a gluco-counterregulatory hormone and identify a critical role for kidney-derived GDF15 in glucose homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.\nNon-image forming vision as measured through ipRGC-mediated pupil constriction is not modulated by covert visual attention\nAuthors: Vilotijevic, A.; Mathot, S.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546729\nIn brightness the pupil constricts, while in darkness the pupil dilates; this is known as the pupillary light response (PLR). The PLR is driven by all photoreceptors: rods and cones, which contribute to image-forming vision, as well as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which contribute to non-image-forming vision. Rods and cones cause immediate pupil constriction upon light exposure, whereas ipRGCs cause sustained constriction for as long as light exposure continues. Recent studies have shown that the initial PLR is modulated by covert attention; however, it remains unclear whether the same holds for the sustained PLR. Here, we investigated the effect of covert attention on sustained, ipRGC-mediated pupil constriction. We leveraged the fact that ipRGCs are predominantly responsive to blue light, causing the most prominent sustained constriction in response to blue light. Replicating previous studies, we found that the pupil constricted more when either directly looking at, or covertly attending to, bright as compared to dim stimuli (with the same color). We also found that the pupil constricted more when directly looking at blue as compared to red stimuli (with the same luminosity); crucially,however, we did not find any difference in pupil size when covertly attending to blue as compared to red stimuli. This suggests that ipRGC-mediated pupil constriction, and possibly non-image-forming vision more generally, is not modulated by covert attention.\nMaternal, placental and fetal response to a non-viral, polymetric nanoparticle gene therapy in nonhuman primates\nAuthors: Wilson, R. L.; Kropp Schmidt, J.; Davenport, B. N.; Ren, E.; Keding, L. T.; Shaw, S.; Schotzko, M. L.; Antony, K.; Simmons, H. A.; Golos, T.; Jones, H.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545278\nBackgroundCurrently, there are no placenta-targeted treatments to alter the in utero environment. Water-soluble polymers have a distinguished record of clinical relevance outside of pregnancy. We have demonstrated the effective delivery of polymer-based nanoparticles containing a non-viral human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) transgene to correct placental insufficiency in small animal models of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Our goal was to extend these studies to the pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) and assess maternal, placental and fetal responses to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment. MethodsPregnant macaques underwent ultrasound-guided intraplacental injections of nanoparticles (GFP- or IGF1-expressing plasmid under the control of the trophoblast-specific PLAC1 promoter complexed with a HPMA-DMEAMA co-polymer) at approximately gestational day 100 (term = 165 days). Fetectomy was performed 24 h (GFP; n =1), 48 h (IGF1; n = 3) or 10 days (IGF1; n = 3) after nanoparticle delivery. Routine pathological assessment was performed on biopsied maternal tissues, and placental and fetal tissues. Maternal blood was analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), immunomodulatory proteins and growth factors, progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Placental ERK/AKT/mTOR signaling was assessed using western blot and qPCR. FindingsFluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization confirmed placental uptake and transgene expression in villous syncytiotrophoblast. No off-target expression was observed in maternal and fetal tissues. Histopathological assessment of the placenta recorded observations not necessarily related to the IGF1 nanoparticle treatment. In maternal blood, CBCs, P4 and E2 remained within the normal range for pregnant macaques across the treatment period. Changes to placental ERK and AKT signaling at 48 h and 10 d after IGF1 nanoparticle treatment indicated an upregulation in placental homeostatic mechanisms to prevent over activity in the normal pregnancy environment. InterpretationMaternal toxicity profile analysis and lack of adverse reaction to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment, combined with changes in placental signaling to maintain homeostasis indicates no deleterious impact of treatment.

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT (n=18) or SQ (n=16) groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intermediary metabolites and flux through various pathways have emerged as key determinants of post-translational modifications. Independently, dynamic fluctuations in their concentrations are known to drive cellular energetics in a bi-directional manner. Notably, intracellular fatty acid pools that drastically change during fed and fasted states act as precursors for both ATP production and fatty acylation of proteins. Protein fatty acylation is well regarded for its role in regulating structure and functions of diverse proteins, however the effect of intracellular concentrations of fatty acids on protein modification is less understood. In this regard, we unequivocally demonstrate that metabolic contexts, viz. fed and fasted states, dictate the extent of global fatty acylation. Moreover, we show that presence or absence of glucose, that influences cellular and mitochondrial uptake/utilization of fatty acids, affects palmitoylation and oleoylation, which is consistent with their intracellular abundance in fed and fasted states. Employing complementary approaches including click-chemistry, lipidomics and imaging, we show the top-down control of cellular metabolic state. Importantly, our results establish the crucial role of mitochondria and retrograde signaling components like SIRT4, AMPK and mTOR in orchestrating protein fatty acylation at a whole cell level. Specifically, pharmacogenetic perturbations that alter either mitochondrial functions and/or retrograde signaling affect protein fatty acylation. Besides illustrating the cross-talk between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mediating bulk post-translational modification, our findings also highlight the involvement of mitochondrial energetics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A strong association of the gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K&#43; channel (p.L114P) with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was recently reported in two distinct families. TALK-1 is a key regulator of {beta}-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). KCNK16, the gene that encodes TALK-1, is the most abundant and {beta}-cell-restricted K&#43; channel transcript and KCNK16 locus is strongly associated to type-2 diabetes. To investigate the impact of TALK-1-L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the Kcnk16 L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous Kcnk16 L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1(ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous Kcnk16 L114P neonates due to lack of GSIS and can be reduced with insulin treatment. TALK-1-L114P drastically increases whole-cell {beta}-cell K&#43; currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca2&#43; entry and a complete loss of glucose-induced Ca2&#43; oscillations. Thus, adult Kcnk16 L114P mice have reduced GSIS and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated TALK-1-L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by altering islet hormone secretion during development. These data strongly suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na&#43; channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na&#43; channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na&#43; channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na&#43; currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na&#43; currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice and the effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the sole target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAge-related loss of strength is disproportionally greater than the loss of mass, suggesting maladaptations in the neuro-myo-tendinous system. Myofibers are often misshaped in aged and diseased muscle, but systematic analyses of large sample sets are lacking. Our aim was to investigate myofiber shape in relation to age, exercise, myofiber type, species, and sex.

MethodsPreviously collected vastus lateralis muscle biopsies (n=265) from 197 males and females, covering an age-span of 20 to 97 years, were examined. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of 7 C57BL/6 mice were also examined. Immunofluorescence and ATPase stainings of muscle cross-sections were used to measure myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and perimeter, from which a shape factor index (SFI) was calculated in a fiber type specific manner (type I and II in humans; type I, IIa, IIx and IIb in mice). Heavy resistance training (RT) was performed 3 times per week for 3-4 months by a subgroup (n=59). Correlation analyses were performed comparing SFI and CSA with age, muscle mass, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), rate of force development (RFD), and specific force (MVC/muscle mass).

ResultsIn human muscle, SFI was positively correlated with age for both type I (R2=0.20) and type II (R2=0.38) myofibers. When subjects were separated into age cohorts, SFI was lower for type I (p&lt;0.001) and II (p&lt;0.001) myofibers in Young (20-36) compared to Old (60-80), and higher for type I (p&lt;0.05) and II (p&lt;0.001) myofibers in the Oldest Old (&gt;80) compared to Old. The increased SFI in old muscle was observed in myofibers of all sizes. Within all three age cohorts, type II myofibers SFI was higher than for type I myofibers (p&lt;0.001), which was also the case in mice muscles (p&lt;0.001). Across age cohorts, there was no difference between males and females in SFI for either type I (p=0.496/0.734) or II (p=0.176/0.585) myofibers. Multiple linear regression revealed that SFI, after adjusting for age and myofiber CSA, has independent explanatory power for 8 out of 10 indices of muscle mass and function. RT reduced SFI of type II myofibers in both Young and Old (p&lt;0.001).

ConclusionsHere, we identify type I and II myofiber shape in humans and mice as a hallmark of muscle ageing, that independently predicts volumetric and functional assessments of muscle health. RT reverts the shape of type II myofibers, indicating that lack of neuromuscular activation might lead to myofiber deformity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The integrative response to exercise differs between sexes, with oxidative energy provision purported as a potential mechanism. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the kinetics of oxygen uptake ([Formula]O2) and extraction (HHb&#43;Mb) during exercise in both sexes. Sixteen young adults (8 females, age: 27{&#43;/-}5 years) completed three experimental visits. Incremental exercise testing was performed to obtain lactate threshold and [Formula]O2peak. Subsequent visits involved three six-minute cycling bouts at 80% of lactate threshold and one 30-minute bout at a work rate 30% between the lactate threshold and maximal ramp test power. Pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy continuously sampled [Formula]O2 and HHb&#43;Mb, respectively. The mean of six moderate and two heavy intensity transitions were modelled with mono-exponential curves to quantify the phase II response to exercise. Slow component amplitudes were also quantified for the heavy intensity domain.

Males and females demonstrated similar relative [Formula]O2peak values (46.2{&#43;/-}6.6 vs 40.5{&#43;/-}6.7 ml.kg- 1.min-1, p=0.111), with males achieving [~]30% greater power outputs (p=0.002). In both the moderate and heavy intensity domains, the relative amplitude of the phase II transition was similar between sexes for [Formula]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.179) and HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.193). Similarly, there were no sex differences in the time constants for [Formula]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.385) or HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.274). In the heavy intensity domain, neither [Formula]O2 (p[&amp;ge;]0.686) or HHb&#43;Mb (p[&amp;ge;]0.432) slow component amplitudes were different between sexes.

The oxidative response to moderate and heavy intensity exercise did not differ between males and females, suggesting both sexes experience similar degrees of bioenergetic stress during intensity-matched exercise.

New and NoteworthyThis study demonstrated no sex differences in the bioenergetic response to moderate and heavy intensity cycling exercise. The change in oxygen uptake and deoxyhaemoglobin were modelled with mono-exponential curve fitting, which revealed that both sexes increased the rate of oxidative energy provision similarly. This provides insight into previously reported sex differences (e.g., fatigability) suggesting that the mechanisms are contractile rather than metabolic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In arterial myocytes, the canonical function of voltage-gated CaV1.2 and KV2.1 channels is to induce myocyte contraction and relaxation through their responses to membrane depolarization, respectively. Paradoxically, KV2.1 also plays a sex-specific role by promoting the clustering and activity of CaV1.2 channels. However, the impact of KV2.1 protein organization on CaV1.2 function remains poorly understood. We discovered that KV2.1 forms micro-clusters, which can transform into large macro-clusters when a critical clustering site (S590) in the channel is phosphorylated in arterial myocytes. Notably, female myocytes exhibit greater phosphorylation of S590, and macro-cluster formation compared to males. Contrary to current models, the activity of KV2.1 channels seems unrelated to density or macro-clustering in arterial myocytes. Disrupting the KV2.1 clustering site (KV2.1S590A) eliminated KV2.1 macro-clustering and sex-specific differences in CaV1.2 cluster size and activity. We propose that the degree of KV2.1 clustering tunes CaV1.2 channel function in a sex-specific manner in arterial myocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Episodic hypoglycemia is one of the best honed, evolutionary conserved phenomena in biology, because of the constant feast-fast cycles that have characterized most of history. The counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, mobilizing substrate stores to produce glucose, is the primary adaptive mechanism to enable survival. Catecholamines and glucagon have long been considered the key hypoglycemia counterregulatory hormones, but here we identify a new hypoglycemia counterregulatory factor. We employed the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp to mimic the two common settings in which hypoglycemia can occur in patients: postprandial insulin overdose and elevated basal insulin administration, respectively. We found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) production is induced in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubules and its release increases hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing intrahepatic lipolysis in a beta-adrenergic receptor-2 (Adrb2)-dependent manner. In addition, mice exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia and patients with T1D exhibit impaired GDF15 production in the setting of hypoglycemia. These data demonstrate that GDF15 acts acutely as a gluco-counterregulatory hormone and identify a critical role for kidney-derived GDF15 in glucose homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In brightness the pupil constricts, while in darkness the pupil dilates; this is known as the pupillary light response (PLR). The PLR is driven by all photoreceptors: rods and cones, which contribute to image-forming vision, as well as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which contribute to non-image-forming vision. Rods and cones cause immediate pupil constriction upon light exposure, whereas ipRGCs cause sustained constriction for as long as light exposure continues. Recent studies have shown that the initial PLR is modulated by covert attention; however, it remains unclear whether the same holds for the sustained PLR. Here, we investigated the effect of covert attention on sustained, ipRGC-mediated pupil constriction. We leveraged the fact that ipRGCs are predominantly responsive to blue light, causing the most prominent sustained constriction in response to blue light. Replicating previous studies, we found that the pupil constricted more when either directly looking at, or covertly attending to, bright as compared to dim stimuli (with the same color). We also found that the pupil constricted more when directly looking at blue as compared to red stimuli (with the same luminosity); crucially,however, we did not find any difference in pupil size when covertly attending to blue as compared to red stimuli. This suggests that ipRGC-mediated pupil constriction, and possibly non-image-forming vision more generally, is not modulated by covert attention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCurrently, there are no placenta-targeted treatments to alter the in utero environment. Water-soluble polymers have a distinguished record of clinical relevance outside of pregnancy. We have demonstrated the effective delivery of polymer-based nanoparticles containing a non-viral human insulin-like 1 growth factor (IGF1) transgene to correct placental insufficiency in small animal models of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Our goal was to extend these studies to the pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) and assess maternal, placental and fetal responses to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment.

MethodsPregnant macaques underwent ultrasound-guided intraplacental injections of nanoparticles (GFP- or IGF1-expressing plasmid under the control of the trophoblast-specific PLAC1 promoter complexed with a HPMA-DMEAMA co-polymer) at approximately gestational day 100 (term = 165 days). Fetectomy was performed 24 h (GFP; n =1), 48 h (IGF1; n = 3) or 10 days (IGF1; n = 3) after nanoparticle delivery. Routine pathological assessment was performed on biopsied maternal tissues, and placental and fetal tissues. Maternal blood was analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), immunomodulatory proteins and growth factors, progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Placental ERK/AKT/mTOR signaling was assessed using western blot and qPCR.

FindingsFluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization confirmed placental uptake and transgene expression in villous syncytiotrophoblast. No off-target expression was observed in maternal and fetal tissues. Histopathological assessment of the placenta recorded observations not necessarily related to the IGF1 nanoparticle treatment. In maternal blood, CBCs, P4 and E2 remained within the normal range for pregnant macaques across the treatment period. Changes to placental ERK and AKT signaling at 48 h and 10 d after IGF1 nanoparticle treatment indicated an upregulation in placental homeostatic mechanisms to prevent over activity in the normal pregnancy environment.

InterpretationMaternal toxicity profile analysis and lack of adverse reaction to nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment, combined with changes in placental signaling to maintain homeostasis indicates no deleterious impact of treatment.
