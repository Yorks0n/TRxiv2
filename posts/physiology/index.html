R.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578211\nMatrix-remodeling associated 8 (MXRA8), also known as Dual immunoglobulin domain cell adhesion molecule (DICAM), is a type 1 transmembrane protein that reportedly binds the V{beta}3 integrin1 and regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts2 and chondrocytes3, tumor growth4, T cell trafficking5, and angiogenesis6. MXRA8 is also an essential entry receptor for chikungunya virus and other related arthritogenic alphaviruses.7-9 We compared MXRA8 expression in 51 tissues in the Human Protein Atlas and found it is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), however the function of MXRA8 in WAT is unknown. Here, we found that MXRA8 expression in WAT is increased in people with obesity and that this response is also observed in a mouse model of high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analyses revealed that MXRA8 is expressed predominantly by adipocyte progenitor (AP) cells and mature adipocytes. MXRA8 mutant primary adipocytes from inguinal (i)WAT exhibited increased expression of Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein expressed by beige and brown adipocytes that limits obesity pathogenesis.10-12 Indeed, MXRA8 mutant mice fed a HFD had preserved UCP1+ beige and brown adipocytes and were protected from HFD-induced obesity in a UCP1-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings indicate that MXRA8 promotes whitening of beige and brown adipose tissues to drive obesity pathogenesis and identify MXRA8 as a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.\nMetformin protects the heart against chronic intermittent hypoxia through AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1Î±\nAuthors: Moulin, S.; Blachot-Minassian, B.; Kneppers, A.; Thomas, A.; Paradis, S.; Bultot, L.; Arnaud, C.; Pepin, J.-L.; Bertrand, L.; Mounier, R.; Belaidi, E.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575152\nChronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1+/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.\nEnhancing mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism ameliorates myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury.\nAuthors: Visker, J. R.; Cluntun, A. A.; Velasco-Silva, J. N.; Eberhardt, D. R.; Shankar, T. S.; Hamouche, R.; Ling, J.; Kwak, H.; Hillas, Y.; Aist, I.; Tseliou, E.; Navankasattusas, S.; Chaudhuri, D.; Ducker, G. S.; Drakos, S. G.; Rutter, J.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.577463\nThe established clinical therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) to restore blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. PPCI is effective at reperfusing the ischemic myocardium, however the rapid re-introduction of oxygenated blood also can cause ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Reperfusion injury is the culprit for up to half of the final myocardial damage, but there are no clinical interventions to reduce I/R injury. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting the lactate exporter, monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), and re-directing pyruvate towards oxidation can blunt isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the same pathway might be important during I/R. Here, we establish that the pyruvate-lactate metabolic axis plays a critical role in determining myocardial salvage following injury. Post-I/R injury, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), required for pyruvate oxidation, is upregulated in the surviving myocardium following I/R injury. MPC loss in cardiomyocytes caused more cell death with less myocardial salvage, which was associated with an upregulation of MCT4 in the myocardium at risk of injury. We deployed a pharmacological strategy of MCT4 inhibition with a highly selective compound (VB124) at the time of reperfusion. This strategy normalized reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}), and Ca2+, increased pyruvate entry to TCA cycle, and improved myocardial salvage and functional outcomes following I/R injury. Altogether, our data suggest that normalizing the pyruvate-lactate metabolic axis via MCT4 inhibition is a promising pharmacological strategy to mitigate I/R injury.

T.; de Goeij, J. M.; Osinga, R.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575017\nGlobal ocean warming and acidification will alter the physicochemical conditions in the deep North-Atlantic Ocean. Here, extensive sponge grounds, often dominated by the demosponge species Geodia barretti, provide three-dimensional structure, habitat and significantly contribute to benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient cycling processes in the deep sea. It is unknown if G. barretti remains physiologically functional under the future physicochemical properties of an Anthropocene ocean. In this study, individuals of G. barretti collected from 300 m water depth in the Barents Sea, were exposed to four treatments resembling future ocean conditions (no treatment, 4 {degrees}C increase in seawater temperature, decrease of seawater pH by 0.3, and a combination of the high temperature, low pH). Over the course of 39 weeks, oxygen consumption, dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes, and bacterioplankton clearance rates were measured as indicators of metabolic activity. We found that all indicators within each sponge individual and per treatment were highly variable over time and no effect of manipulated seawater treatments on these parameters could be demonstrated. Oxygen consumption rates in all groups closely followed a seasonal pattern, potentially caused by (a)biotic cues in the seawater flowing through the experimental aquaria. While similar metabolic rates across all treatments suggest that G. barretti physiologically coped with simulated future ocean conditions, observed tissue necrosis in experimental animals might indicate that the response of the complex, high microbial G. barretti sponge (i.e., sponge host and microbial symbionts) to future ocean conditions may not be reflected in basic physiological processes.\nEarly body weight gain in TALLYHO/JngJ mice predicts adult diabetic phenotype, mimicking childhood obesity\nAuthors: Hastreiter, S.; Hoffmann, S.; Richter, K.; Irmler, M.; Gerlini, R.; Fuchs, H.; Gailus-Dumer, V.; Gailus-Durner, V.; Korner, A.; Hrabe de Angelis, M.; Beckers, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577705\nChildhood obesity and type 2 diabetes are two emerging health issues worldwide. To analyze their underlying causes and develop prevention strategies, mouse models are urgently needed. We present novel insights into the polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model for diabetes. By precisely analyzing our original phenotypic data, we discovered that body weight at weaning age is the main predictor of the adult phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice. The higher the weaning weight of male mice, the more likely they are to develop diabetes later in life. In contrast, a low weaning weight protected against the development of the diabetic phenotype in adults. In females, we found that high weaning body weights led to a constant higher body weight throughout life. We also showed that specifically the suckling period, rather than the in utero period, is crucial for the development of the metabolic phenotype in later life. We observed an earlier onset of diabetes when the mice had higher body weights at weaning, aligning with metabolic histories observed in humans. Therefore, we recommend TALLYHO/JngJ mice as a model to investigate childhood obesity and to develop prevention strategies. HighlightsO_LIThe polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model is used to investigate type 2 diabetes, but the penetrance of the phenotype is highly variable. C_LIO_LIWe deeply analyzed our phenotype data and find that body weight at the age of weaning (BWW) is the main predictor for the obese and diabetic phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ male mice later in life. C_LIO_LIWe suggest that TALLYHO/JngJ male mice are an excellent and urgently needed model to study childhood obesity. C_LIO_LIOur data help the relevant scientific community to better control the penetrance of the diabetic phenotype in male TALLYHO/JngJ mice.

Although ambient temperature tunes glucose metabolism to maintain euthermia, the significance of body temperature in metabolic regulation remains unclear owing to strict thermoregulation. Activation of Qrfp neurons in the preoptic area induced a harmless hypothermic state known as Q-neuron-induced hypothermia and hypometabolism (QIH), which is suitable for studying glucose metabolism under hypothermia. In this study, we first observed that QIH mice had hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This glucose hypometabolic state was abolished by increasing the body temperature to euthermia. Moreover, QIH-mediated inappetence and locomotor inactivity were recovered in euthermia QIH mice. These results indicate that body temperature is considerably more powerful than ambient temperature in regulating glucose metabolism and behavior, and hypometabolism in QIH is secondary to hypothermia rather than modulated by Qrfp neurons. HighlightsO_LIQIH reorganizes glucose homeostasis which is unchanged by fasting. C_LIO_LIQIH mice exhibit glucose hypometabolism with hyperinsuliemia and insulin resistance. C_LIO_LIIncreased body temperature abolishes QIH-mediated hypometabolism and torpid behaviors. C_LIO_LIBody temperature is a strong factor in controlling metabolism and behavior. C_LIO_LIBody temperature-mediated glucose metabolism is reversible.

A.; Kuznetsov, A.; Freeman, R.; Bogoslavski, D.; Ellinor, P. T.; Asnani, A.; Dumesic, P. A.; Puigserver, P.; Roh, J. D.; Spiegelman, B. M.; Rosenzweig, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578093\nExercise training induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and myocardial contractility. In skeletal muscle, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is a key orchestrator of these responses. The heart expresses abundant and exercise-responsive PGC-1, but it is unclear whether cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is necessary for cardiac adaptation to endurance training. Here we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is required for physiological cardiac hypertrophy during exercise training in mice. In the absence of cardiomyocyte PGC-1, voluntary wheel running does not improve exercise capacity and instead confers immune-fibrotic-atrophic heart failure after just 6 weeks of training. We identify cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a negative regulator of stress-responsive senescence gene expression. The most enriched of these is the myomitokine GDF15. GDF15 is secreted locally but not systemically in PGC-1-deficient mouse hearts and reduces cardiomyocyte size. Cardiomyocyte-specific reduction of GDF15 expression preserves exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility in PGC-1-deficient mice during endurance training. Finally, we show that cardiomyocyte PPARGC1A expression correlates with cardiomyocyte number and negatively with GDF15 expression in human cardiomyopathies through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Our data implicate cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a vital safeguard against stress-induced atrophy and local GDF15-induced dysfunction during exercise.\nNPAS4 is an allostatic regulator of POMC neuronal activity during diet-induced obesity\nAuthors: Yoon, J. S.; Gamu, D.; Gibson, W. T.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.574247\nRationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity. MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons. ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates. ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.\nBehavioural responses to acute warming precede critical shifts in the cellular and physiological thermal stress responses in fish\nAuthors: Durhack, T. C.; Thorstensen, M. J.; Mackey, T. E.; Aminot, M.; Lawrence, M. J.; Audet, C.; Enders, E. C.; Jeffries, K. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577477\nFrom a conservation perspective, it is important to identify when sub-lethal temperatures begin to adversely impact an organism. However, it is unclear whether, during acute exposures, these cellular thresholds occur at similar temperatures to other physiological or behavioural changes. To test this, we estimated temperature preference (15.1 {+/-} 1.1 {degrees}C) using a shuttle box, thermal optima for aerobic scope (10-15 {degrees}C) using respirometry, agitation temperature (22.0 {+/-} 1.4 {degrees}C) as the point where a fish exhibits a behavioural avoidance response and the CTmax (28.2 {+/-} 0.4 {degrees}C) as the upper thermal limit for 1 yr old Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) acclimated to 10 {degrees}C. We then acutely exposed a different subset of fish to these temperatures and sampled tissues when they reached the target temperature or after 60 min of recovery at 10 {degrees}C. We used qPCR to estimate mRNA transcript levels of genes associated with heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inducible transcription factors. A major shift in the transcriptome response occurred near the agitation temperature, which may identify a link between the cellular stress response and the behavioural avoidance response.\nInhibition of IRAK4 by microbial trimethylamine blunts metabolic inflammation and ameliorates glycemic control\nAuthors: Chilloux, J.; Brial, F.; Everard, A.; Smyth, D.; Andrikopoulos, P.; Zhang, L.; Plovier, H.; Myridakis, A.; Hoyles, L.; Moreno-Navarrete, J.

E.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/277434\nThe global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis and there is a critical need for innovative strategies to fight it. Although the microbiome plays important roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation, the microbial compounds regulating these phenomena remain to be discovered. Here, we reveal that the microbiome inhibits a central kinase, eliciting immune and metabolic benefits. Through a series of in vivo experiments based on choline supplementation, blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production then administering TMA, we demonstrate that TMA decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Through in vitro kinome screens, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase integrating signals from various toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells, and improves mouse survival after a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Consistent with this, genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears to be a key microbial compound inhibiting IRAK4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Matrix-remodeling associated 8 (MXRA8), also known as Dual immunoglobulin domain cell adhesion molecule (DICAM), is a type 1 transmembrane protein that reportedly binds the V{beta}3 integrin1 and regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts2 and chondrocytes3, tumor growth4, T cell trafficking5, and angiogenesis6. MXRA8 is also an essential entry receptor for chikungunya virus and other related arthritogenic alphaviruses.7-9 We compared MXRA8 expression in 51 tissues in the Human Protein Atlas and found it is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), however the function of MXRA8 in WAT is unknown. Here, we found that MXRA8 expression in WAT is increased in people with obesity and that this response is also observed in a mouse model of high fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry analyses revealed that MXRA8 is expressed predominantly by adipocyte progenitor (AP) cells and mature adipocytes. MXRA8 mutant primary adipocytes from inguinal (i)WAT exhibited increased expression of Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein expressed by beige and brown adipocytes that limits obesity pathogenesis.10-12 Indeed, MXRA8 mutant mice fed a HFD had preserved UCP1&#43; beige and brown adipocytes and were protected from HFD-induced obesity in a UCP1-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings indicate that MXRA8 promotes whitening of beige and brown adipose tissues to drive obesity pathogenesis and identify MXRA8 as a possible therapeutic target to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1&#43;/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPK2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPK2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1 nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1 phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPK2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The established clinical therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) to restore blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. PPCI is effective at reperfusing the ischemic myocardium, however the rapid re-introduction of oxygenated blood also can cause ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Reperfusion injury is the culprit for up to half of the final myocardial damage, but there are no clinical interventions to reduce I/R injury. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting the lactate exporter, monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), and re-directing pyruvate towards oxidation can blunt isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the same pathway might be important during I/R. Here, we establish that the pyruvate-lactate metabolic axis plays a critical role in determining myocardial salvage following injury. Post-I/R injury, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), required for pyruvate oxidation, is upregulated in the surviving myocardium following I/R injury. MPC loss in cardiomyocytes caused more cell death with less myocardial salvage, which was associated with an upregulation of MCT4 in the myocardium at risk of injury. We deployed a pharmacological strategy of MCT4 inhibition with a highly selective compound (VB124) at the time of reperfusion. This strategy normalized reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}), and Ca2&#43;, increased pyruvate entry to TCA cycle, and improved myocardial salvage and functional outcomes following I/R injury. Altogether, our data suggest that normalizing the pyruvate-lactate metabolic axis via MCT4 inhibition is a promising pharmacological strategy to mitigate I/R injury.

        <p class="abstract">Global ocean warming and acidification will alter the physicochemical conditions in the deep North-Atlantic Ocean. Here, extensive sponge grounds, often dominated by the demosponge species Geodia barretti, provide three-dimensional structure, habitat and significantly contribute to benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient cycling processes in the deep sea. It is unknown if G. barretti remains physiologically functional under the future physicochemical properties of an Anthropocene ocean. In this study, individuals of G. barretti collected from 300 m water depth in the Barents Sea, were exposed to four treatments resembling future ocean conditions (no treatment, 4 {degrees}C increase in seawater temperature, decrease of seawater pH by 0.3, and a combination of the high temperature, low pH). Over the course of 39 weeks, oxygen consumption, dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes, and bacterioplankton clearance rates were measured as indicators of metabolic activity. We found that all indicators within each sponge individual and per treatment were highly variable over time and no effect of manipulated seawater treatments on these parameters could be demonstrated. Oxygen consumption rates in all groups closely followed a seasonal pattern, potentially caused by (a)biotic cues in the seawater flowing through the experimental aquaria. While similar metabolic rates across all treatments suggest that G. barretti physiologically coped with simulated future ocean conditions, observed tissue necrosis in experimental animals might indicate that the response of the complex, high microbial G. barretti sponge (i.e., sponge host and microbial symbionts) to future ocean conditions may not be reflected in basic physiological processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes are two emerging health issues worldwide. To analyze their underlying causes and develop prevention strategies, mouse models are urgently needed. We present novel insights into the polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model for diabetes. By precisely analyzing our original phenotypic data, we discovered that body weight at weaning age is the main predictor of the adult phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice. The higher the weaning weight of male mice, the more likely they are to develop diabetes later in life. In contrast, a low weaning weight protected against the development of the diabetic phenotype in adults. In females, we found that high weaning body weights led to a constant higher body weight throughout life. We also showed that specifically the suckling period, rather than the in utero period, is crucial for the development of the metabolic phenotype in later life. We observed an earlier onset of diabetes when the mice had higher body weights at weaning, aligning with metabolic histories observed in humans. Therefore, we recommend TALLYHO/JngJ mice as a model to investigate childhood obesity and to develop prevention strategies.

HighlightsO_LIThe polygenic TALLYHO/JngJ mouse model is used to investigate type 2 diabetes, but the penetrance of the phenotype is highly variable.
C_LIO_LIWe deeply analyzed our phenotype data and find that body weight at the age of weaning (BWW) is the main predictor for the obese and diabetic phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ male mice later in life.
C_LIO_LIWe suggest that TALLYHO/JngJ male mice are an excellent and urgently needed model to study childhood obesity.
C_LIO_LIOur data help the relevant scientific community to better control the penetrance of the diabetic phenotype in male TALLYHO/JngJ mice.

        <p class="abstract">Glucose is a significant energy resource for maintaining physiological activities, including body temperature homeostasis, and glucose homeostasis is tightly regulated in mammals. Although ambient temperature tunes glucose metabolism to maintain euthermia, the significance of body temperature in metabolic regulation remains unclear owing to strict thermoregulation. Activation of Qrfp neurons in the preoptic area induced a harmless hypothermic state known as Q-neuron-induced hypothermia and hypometabolism (QIH), which is suitable for studying glucose metabolism under hypothermia. In this study, we first observed that QIH mice had hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This glucose hypometabolic state was abolished by increasing the body temperature to euthermia. Moreover, QIH-mediated inappetence and locomotor inactivity were recovered in euthermia QIH mice. These results indicate that body temperature is considerably more powerful than ambient temperature in regulating glucose metabolism and behavior, and hypometabolism in QIH is secondary to hypothermia rather than modulated by Qrfp neurons.

HighlightsO_LIQIH reorganizes glucose homeostasis which is unchanged by fasting.
C_LIO_LIQIH mice exhibit glucose hypometabolism with hyperinsuliemia and insulin resistance.
C_LIO_LIIncreased body temperature abolishes QIH-mediated hypometabolism and torpid behaviors.
C_LIO_LIBody temperature is a strong factor in controlling metabolism and behavior.
C_LIO_LIBody temperature-mediated glucose metabolism is reversible.

        <p class="abstract">Exercise training induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and myocardial contractility. In skeletal muscle, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is a key orchestrator of these responses. The heart expresses abundant and exercise-responsive PGC-1, but it is unclear whether cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is necessary for cardiac adaptation to endurance training. Here we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte PGC-1 is required for physiological cardiac hypertrophy during exercise training in mice. In the absence of cardiomyocyte PGC-1, voluntary wheel running does not improve exercise capacity and instead confers immune-fibrotic-atrophic heart failure after just 6 weeks of training. We identify cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a negative regulator of stress-responsive senescence gene expression. The most enriched of these is the myomitokine GDF15. GDF15 is secreted locally but not systemically in PGC-1-deficient mouse hearts and reduces cardiomyocyte size. Cardiomyocyte-specific reduction of GDF15 expression preserves exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility in PGC-1-deficient mice during endurance training. Finally, we show that cardiomyocyte PPARGC1A expression correlates with cardiomyocyte number and negatively with GDF15 expression in human cardiomyopathies through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Our data implicate cardiomyocyte PGC-1 as a vital safeguard against stress-induced atrophy and local GDF15-induced dysfunction during exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleObesity is characterized by a chronic positive energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity- regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity.

MethodsWe quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) at room temperature. In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding- regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons.

ResultsNpas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC- NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or physical activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the observed lack of gain in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates.

ConclusionsTaken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell- autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From a conservation perspective, it is important to identify when sub-lethal temperatures begin to adversely impact an organism. However, it is unclear whether, during acute exposures, these cellular thresholds occur at similar temperatures to other physiological or behavioural changes. To test this, we estimated temperature preference (15.1 {&#43;/-} 1.1 {degrees}C) using a shuttle box, thermal optima for aerobic scope (10-15 {degrees}C) using respirometry, agitation temperature (22.0 {&#43;/-} 1.4 {degrees}C) as the point where a fish exhibits a behavioural avoidance response and the CTmax (28.2 {&#43;/-} 0.4 {degrees}C) as the upper thermal limit for 1 yr old Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) acclimated to 10 {degrees}C. We then acutely exposed a different subset of fish to these temperatures and sampled tissues when they reached the target temperature or after 60 min of recovery at 10 {degrees}C. We used qPCR to estimate mRNA transcript levels of genes associated with heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inducible transcription factors. A major shift in the transcriptome response occurred near the agitation temperature, which may identify a link between the cellular stress response and the behavioural avoidance response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis and there is a critical need for innovative strategies to fight it. Although the microbiome plays important roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation, the microbial compounds regulating these phenomena remain to be discovered. Here, we reveal that the microbiome inhibits a central kinase, eliciting immune and metabolic benefits. Through a series of in vivo experiments based on choline supplementation, blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production then administering TMA, we demonstrate that TMA decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Through in vitro kinome screens, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase integrating signals from various toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells, and improves mouse survival after a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Consistent with this, genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears to be a key microbial compound inhibiting IRAK4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.</p>
