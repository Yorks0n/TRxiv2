Ozanne, S.; Peffers, M. J.; Jackson, M. J.; Goljanek-Whysall, K.; Vasilaki, A.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559536\nThe early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.\nDifferential utilisation of subcellular skeletal muscle glycogen pools: A comparative analysis between 1 and 15 minutes of maximal exercise\nAuthors: Schytz, C. T.; Ortenblad, N.; Gejl, K. D.; Nielsen, J.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559993\nDistinct subcellular pools of glycogen particles exist within skeletal muscle fibres, distributed both within and between myofibrils and can be found in proximity to, or at a distance from mitochondria. Their precise localisation may influence their degradation rate and role in muscle function. Here, we investigated how exercise at different intensities (1- and 15-min maximal exercise) with known variations in glycogenolytic rate and relative contribution from anaerobic metabolism affects the utilisation of the distinct pools. Further, we investigated how lowered carbohydrate and energy intake affected glycogen volume densities and the storage of glycogen particles (i.e., localisation, size, and number) and their subsequent utilisation during the exercises. Using a randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, participants performed two maximal cycle tests of either 1 (n=10) or 15 min (n=10), conducted following consumption of two distinct diets with either high or lowered carbohydrate and energy contents. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained before and after the exercises. Intermyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 1-min exercise, whereas intramyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 15-min exercise. The lowered carbohydrate and energy intake decreased the particle size across all subcellular pools and reduced the numerical density in the intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal pools, with no effects on the glycogen utilisation during the subsequent exercise. In conclusion, the distinct subcellular glycogen pools were differentially utilised during 1-min and 15-min maximal exercise. Additionally, lowered carbohydrate and energy consumption reduces particle size and numerical density, depending on subcellular localisation.\nInhibition of mammalian mtDNA transcription paradoxically activates liver fatty acid oxidation to reverse diet-induced hepatosteatosis and obesity\nAuthors: Jiang, S.; Yuan, T.; Kremer, L. S.; Rosenberger, F. A.; Hansen, F. M.; Borg, M.; Rubalcava-Gracia, D.; Mennuni, M.; Filograna, R.; Alsina, D.; Misic, J.; Koolmeister, C.; Ren, L.; Andersson, O.; Unger, A.; Bergbrede, T.; Lucrezia, R. D.; Wilbom, R.; Zierath, J. R.; Krook, A.; Giavalisco, P.; Mann, M.; Larsson, N.-G.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558955\nThe oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.\nImmunohistochemical and ultrastructural characterization of the inner ear epithelial cells of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa)\nAuthors: Kwan, G. T.; Prime, K. J.; Andrade, L. R.; Tresguerres, M.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558895\nThe inner ear of teleost fish regulates the ionic and acid-base chemistry and secretes the protein matrix of the endolymph to facilitate otolith biomineralization, which are used to maintain vestibular and auditory functions. The otolith is biomineralized in a concentric ring pattern corresponding to seasonal growth, and this CaCO3 polycrystal has become a vital aging and life-history tool for fishery managers, ecologists, and conservation biologists. Moreover, biomineralization patterns are sensitive to environmental variability including climate change, thereby threatening the accuracy and relevance of otolith-reliant toolkits. However, the cellular biology of the inner ear is poorly characterized, which is a hurdle for a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. This study provides a systematic characterization of the cell types in the inner ear of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the apical morphologies of the six inner ear cell types. Additionally, immunostaining and confocal microscopy characterized the expression and subcellular localization of the proteins Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, V-type H+-ATPase, Na+-K+-2Cl--Co-Transporter, Otolith Matrix Protein 1, and Otolin-1 in six inner ear cell types bordering the endolymph. This fundamental cytological characterization of the rockfish inner ear epithelium illustrates the intricate physiological processes involved in otolith biomineralization, and highlights how greater mechanistic understanding is necessary to predict their multi-stressor responses to future climate change.\nThe effects of queen mandibular pheromone on nurse-aged honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) hypopharyngeal gland size and lipid metabolism\nAuthors: Oreshkova, A.; Scofield, S.; Amdam, G. V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559206\nQueen honey bees (Apis mellifera) release Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) to regulate traits in the caste of female helpers called workers. QMP signals the queens presence and suppresses worker reproduction. In the absence of reproduction, young workers take care of the queen and her larvae (nurse tasks), while older workers forage. In nurses, QMP increases lipid stores in abdominal fat tissue (fat body) and protein content in hypopharyngeal glands (HPG). HPG are worker-specific head glands that can synthesize royal jelly used in colony nourishment. Larger HPG signifies ability to secrete royal jelly, while shrunken glands characterize foragers that do not make jelly. While it is known that QMP increases abdominal lipid stores, the mechanism is unclear: Does QMP make workers consume more pollen which provides lipids, or does QMP increase lipogenic capacity? Here, we measure abdominal lipogenic capacity as fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity while monitoring abdominal protein content and HPG size in caged workers. Cages allow us to rigorously control worker age, pheromone exposure, and diet. In our 2-factorial design, 3-vs. 8-day-old workers (age factor) were exposed to synthetic QMP or not (pheromone factor) while consuming a lipid deficient diet. We found that QMP did not influence abdominal FAS activity or protein content, but QMP still increased HPG size in the absence of dietary lipids. Our data revealed a positive correlation between abdominal protein content and HPG size. Our findings show that QMP is not a strong modulator of lipogenic capacity in caged worker bees. However, our data may reflect that QMP mobilizes abdominal protein for production of jelly, in line with previous findings on effects of honey bee Brood Pheromone. Overall, our study expands the understanding of how QMP can affect honey bee workers. Such insights are important beyond regulatory biology, as QMP is used in various aspects of beekeeping.\nValidity and reliability of a new whole room indirect calorimeter to assess metabolic response to small-calorie loads\nAuthors: Baugh, M. E.; Ahrens, M. L.; Hutelin, Z.; Stylianos, C.; Wohlers-Kariesch, E.; Oster, M. E.; Dotson, J.; Moon, J.; Hanlon, A. L. E.; DiFeliceantonio, A. G.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558672\nObjectiveTo provide an overview of our whole room indirect calorimeter (WRIC), demonstrate validity and reliability of our WRIC, and explore a novel application of Bayesian hierarchical modeling to assess responses to small carbohydrate loads. MethodsSeven gas infusion studies were performed using a gas blender and profiles designed to mimic resting and postprandial metabolic events to assess WRIC validity. In a crossover design, 16 participants underwent fasting and postprandial measurements, during which they consumed a 75-kcal drink containing sucrose, dextrose, or fructose. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare resting and postprandial metabolic rate (MR) and CO (CO). Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling was also used to model postprandial CO trajectories for each participant and condition. ResultsMean total error in infusions were 1.27 {+/-} 1.16% and 0.42 {+/-} 1.21% for VO2 and VCO2 respectively, indicating a high level of validity. Mean resting MR was similar across conditions ([Formula] =1.05 {+/-} 0.03 kcal/min, p=0.82, ICC: 0.91). While MR increased similarly among all conditions ([~]13%, p=0.29), postprandial CO parameters were significantly lower for dextrose compared with sucrose or fructose. ConclusionsOur WRIC validation and novel application of statistical methods presented here provide important foundations for new research directions using WRIC.\nDirect Regulation of the Voltage Sensor of HCN Channels by Membrane Lipid Compartmentalization\nAuthors: Handlin, L. J.; Dai, G.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545112\nIon channels function within a membrane environment characterized by dynamic lipid compartmentalization. Limited knowledge exists regarding the response of voltage-gated ion channels to transmembrane potential within distinct membrane compartments. By leveraging fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we visualized the localization of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in membrane domains. HCN4 exhibits a greater propensity for incorporation into ordered lipid domains compared to HCN1. To investigate the conformational changes of the S4 helix voltage sensor of HCN channels, we used dual stop-codon suppression to incorporate different noncanonical amino acids, orthogonal click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling, and transition metal FLIM-FRET. Remarkably, altered FRET levels were observed between VSD sites within HCN channels upon disruption of membrane domains. We propose that the voltage-sensor rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases.\nA Genetically Encoded Actuator Selectively Boosts L-type Calcium Channels in Diverse Physiological Settings\nAuthors: del Rivero Morfin, P. J.; Scala Chavez, D.; Jayaraman, S.; Yang, L.; Kochiss, A.; Colecraft, H. M.; Liu, X. S.; Marx, S. O.; Rajadhyaksha, A. M.; Ben-Johny, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558856\nL-type Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2/1.3) convey influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) that orchestrate a bevy of biological responses including muscle contraction and gene transcription. Deficits in CaV1 function play a vital role in cardiac and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet conventional pharmacological approaches to upregulate CaV1 are limited, as excessive Ca2+ influx leads to cytotoxicity. Here, we develop a genetically encoded enhancer of CaV1.2/1.3 channels (GeeC) to manipulate Ca2+ entry in distinct physiological settings. Specifically, we functionalized a nanobody that targets the CaV macromolecular complex by attaching a minimal effector domain from a CaV enhancer--leucine rich repeat containing protein 10 (Lrrc10). In cardiomyocytes, GeeC evoked a 3-fold increase in L-type current amplitude. In neurons, GeeC augmented excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling. In all, GeeC represents a powerful strategy to boost CaV1.2/1.3 function in distinct physiological settings and, in so doing, lays the groundwork to illuminate new insights on neuronal and cardiac physiology and disease.\nBeneficial metabolic effects of PAHSAs depend on the gut microbiota in diet-induced obese mice\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Wellenstein, K.; Rahnavard, A.; Nelson, A. T.; Holter, M.; Cummings, B. P.; Yeliseyev, V.; Castoldi, A.; Clish, C. B.; Bry, L.; Siegel, D.; Kahn, B. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.558803\nDietary lipids play an essential role in regulating the function of the gut microbiota and gastrointestinal tract, and these luminal interactions contribute to mediating host metabolism. PAHSAs are a class of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether the gut microbiome contributes to their beneficial effects on host metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that treating high fat diet (HFD)-fed germ-free mice with PAHSAs does not improve insulin sensitivity. However, transfer of feces from PAHSA-treated, but not Vehicle-treated, chow-fed mice increases insulin-sensitivity in HFD-fed germ free mice. Thus, the gut microbiota is necessary for and can transmit the insulin-sensitizing effects of PAHSAs in HFD-fed germ-free mice. Functional analyses of the cecal metagenome and lipidome of PAHSA-treated mice identified multiple lipid species that associate with the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and with insulin sensitivity resulting from PAHSA treatment. Bt supplementation in HFD-fed female mice prevented weight gain, reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, fortified the colonic mucus barrier and reduced systemic inflammation versus chow-fed controls, effects that were not observed in HFD-fed male mice. Furthermore, ovariectomy partially reversed the beneficial Bt effects on host metabolism, indicating a role for sex hormones in mediating probiotic effects. Altogether, these studies highlight the fact that lipids can modulate the gut microbiota resulting in improvement in host metabolism and that PAHSA-induced changes in the microbiota result in at least some of their insulin-sensitizing effects in female mice.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Distinct subcellular pools of glycogen particles exist within skeletal muscle fibres, distributed both within and between myofibrils and can be found in proximity to, or at a distance from mitochondria. Their precise localisation may influence their degradation rate and role in muscle function. Here, we investigated how exercise at different intensities (1- and 15-min maximal exercise) with known variations in glycogenolytic rate and relative contribution from anaerobic metabolism affects the utilisation of the distinct pools. Further, we investigated how lowered carbohydrate and energy intake affected glycogen volume densities and the storage of glycogen particles (i.e., localisation, size, and number) and their subsequent utilisation during the exercises. Using a randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, participants performed two maximal cycle tests of either 1 (n=10) or 15 min (n=10), conducted following consumption of two distinct diets with either high or lowered carbohydrate and energy contents. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained before and after the exercises. Intermyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 1-min exercise, whereas intramyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 15-min exercise. The lowered carbohydrate and energy intake decreased the particle size across all subcellular pools and reduced the numerical density in the intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal pools, with no effects on the glycogen utilisation during the subsequent exercise. In conclusion, the distinct subcellular glycogen pools were differentially utilised during 1-min and 15-min maximal exercise. Additionally, lowered carbohydrate and energy consumption reduces particle size and numerical density, depending on subcellular localisation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The inner ear of teleost fish regulates the ionic and acid-base chemistry and secretes the protein matrix of the endolymph to facilitate otolith biomineralization, which are used to maintain vestibular and auditory functions. The otolith is biomineralized in a concentric ring pattern corresponding to seasonal growth, and this CaCO3 polycrystal has become a vital aging and life-history tool for fishery managers, ecologists, and conservation biologists. Moreover, biomineralization patterns are sensitive to environmental variability including climate change, thereby threatening the accuracy and relevance of otolith-reliant toolkits. However, the cellular biology of the inner ear is poorly characterized, which is a hurdle for a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. This study provides a systematic characterization of the cell types in the inner ear of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the apical morphologies of the six inner ear cell types. Additionally, immunostaining and confocal microscopy characterized the expression and subcellular localization of the proteins Na&#43;/K&#43;-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, V-type H&#43;-ATPase, Na&#43;-K&#43;-2Cl--Co-Transporter, Otolith Matrix Protein 1, and Otolin-1 in six inner ear cell types bordering the endolymph. This fundamental cytological characterization of the rockfish inner ear epithelium illustrates the intricate physiological processes involved in otolith biomineralization, and highlights how greater mechanistic understanding is necessary to predict their multi-stressor responses to future climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Queen honey bees (Apis mellifera) release Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) to regulate traits in the caste of female helpers called workers. QMP signals the queens presence and suppresses worker reproduction. In the absence of reproduction, young workers take care of the queen and her larvae (nurse tasks), while older workers forage. In nurses, QMP increases lipid stores in abdominal fat tissue (fat body) and protein content in hypopharyngeal glands (HPG). HPG are worker-specific head glands that can synthesize royal jelly used in colony nourishment. Larger HPG signifies ability to secrete royal jelly, while shrunken glands characterize foragers that do not make jelly. While it is known that QMP increases abdominal lipid stores, the mechanism is unclear: Does QMP make workers consume more pollen which provides lipids, or does QMP increase lipogenic capacity? Here, we measure abdominal lipogenic capacity as fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity while monitoring abdominal protein content and HPG size in caged workers. Cages allow us to rigorously control worker age, pheromone exposure, and diet. In our 2-factorial design, 3-vs. 8-day-old workers (age factor) were exposed to synthetic QMP or not (pheromone factor) while consuming a lipid deficient diet. We found that QMP did not influence abdominal FAS activity or protein content, but QMP still increased HPG size in the absence of dietary lipids. Our data revealed a positive correlation between abdominal protein content and HPG size. Our findings show that QMP is not a strong modulator of lipogenic capacity in caged worker bees. However, our data may reflect that QMP mobilizes abdominal protein for production of jelly, in line with previous findings on effects of honey bee Brood Pheromone. Overall, our study expands the understanding of how QMP can affect honey bee workers. Such insights are important beyond regulatory biology, as QMP is used in various aspects of beekeeping.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo provide an overview of our whole room indirect calorimeter (WRIC), demonstrate validity and reliability of our WRIC, and explore a novel application of Bayesian hierarchical modeling to assess responses to small carbohydrate loads.

MethodsSeven gas infusion studies were performed using a gas blender and profiles designed to mimic resting and postprandial metabolic events to assess WRIC validity. In a crossover design, 16 participants underwent fasting and postprandial measurements, during which they consumed a 75-kcal drink containing sucrose, dextrose, or fructose. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare resting and postprandial metabolic rate (MR) and CO (CO). Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling was also used to model postprandial CO trajectories for each participant and condition.

ResultsMean total error in infusions were 1.27 {&#43;/-} 1.16% and 0.42 {&#43;/-} 1.21% for VO2 and VCO2 respectively, indicating a high level of validity. Mean resting MR was similar across conditions ([Formula] =1.05 {&#43;/-} 0.03 kcal/min, p=0.82, ICC: 0.91). While MR increased similarly among all conditions ([~]13%, p=0.29), postprandial CO parameters were significantly lower for dextrose compared with sucrose or fructose.

ConclusionsOur WRIC validation and novel application of statistical methods presented here provide important foundations for new research directions using WRIC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ion channels function within a membrane environment characterized by dynamic lipid compartmentalization. Limited knowledge exists regarding the response of voltage-gated ion channels to transmembrane potential within distinct membrane compartments. By leveraging fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we visualized the localization of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in membrane domains. HCN4 exhibits a greater propensity for incorporation into ordered lipid domains compared to HCN1. To investigate the conformational changes of the S4 helix voltage sensor of HCN channels, we used dual stop-codon suppression to incorporate different noncanonical amino acids, orthogonal click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling, and transition metal FLIM-FRET. Remarkably, altered FRET levels were observed between VSD sites within HCN channels upon disruption of membrane domains. We propose that the voltage-sensor rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">L-type Ca2&#43; channels (CaV1.2/1.3) convey influx of calcium ions (Ca2&#43;) that orchestrate a bevy of biological responses including muscle contraction and gene transcription. Deficits in CaV1 function play a vital role in cardiac and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet conventional pharmacological approaches to upregulate CaV1 are limited, as excessive Ca2&#43; influx leads to cytotoxicity. Here, we develop a genetically encoded enhancer of CaV1.2/1.3 channels (GeeC) to manipulate Ca2&#43; entry in distinct physiological settings. Specifically, we functionalized a nanobody that targets the CaV macromolecular complex by attaching a minimal effector domain from a CaV enhancer--leucine rich repeat containing protein 10 (Lrrc10). In cardiomyocytes, GeeC evoked a 3-fold increase in L-type current amplitude. In neurons, GeeC augmented excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling. In all, GeeC represents a powerful strategy to boost CaV1.2/1.3 function in distinct physiological settings and, in so doing, lays the groundwork to illuminate new insights on neuronal and cardiac physiology and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary lipids play an essential role in regulating the function of the gut microbiota and gastrointestinal tract, and these luminal interactions contribute to mediating host metabolism. PAHSAs are a class of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether the gut microbiome contributes to their beneficial effects on host metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that treating high fat diet (HFD)-fed germ-free mice with PAHSAs does not improve insulin sensitivity. However, transfer of feces from PAHSA-treated, but not Vehicle-treated, chow-fed mice increases insulin-sensitivity in HFD-fed germ free mice. Thus, the gut microbiota is necessary for and can transmit the insulin-sensitizing effects of PAHSAs in HFD-fed germ-free mice. Functional analyses of the cecal metagenome and lipidome of PAHSA-treated mice identified multiple lipid species that associate with the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and with insulin sensitivity resulting from PAHSA treatment. Bt supplementation in HFD-fed female mice prevented weight gain, reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, fortified the colonic mucus barrier and reduced systemic inflammation versus chow-fed controls, effects that were not observed in HFD-fed male mice. Furthermore, ovariectomy partially reversed the beneficial Bt effects on host metabolism, indicating a role for sex hormones in mediating probiotic effects. Altogether, these studies highlight the fact that lipids can modulate the gut microbiota resulting in improvement in host metabolism and that PAHSA-induced changes in the microbiota result in at least some of their insulin-sensitizing effects in female mice.</p>
