C.; Miller, E. W.\nScore: 34.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561080\nBiological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes. Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both. We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence. Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages. Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.\nThe impact of short-lived controls on the interpretation of lifespan experiments and progress in geroscience\nAuthors: Pabis, K. K.; Barardo, D.; Gruber, J.; Sirbu, O.; Selvarajoo, K.; Kaeberlein, M.; Kennedy, B. K.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561459\nAlthough lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups. To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this \"900-day rule\" we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.\nTMEM65 regulates NCLX-dependent mitochondrial calcium efflux\nAuthors: Garbincius, J. F.; Salik, O.; Cohen, H. M.; Choya-Foces, C.; Mangold, A. S.; Makhoul, A. D.; Schmidt, A. E.; Khalil, D. Y.; Doolittle, J. J.; Wilkinson, A. S.; Murray, E. K.; Lazaropoulos, M. P.; Hildebrand, A. N.; Tomar, D.; Elrod, J. W.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561062\nThe balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2+ overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2+ efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2+ overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na+)-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2+ efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na+-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2+ overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2+ stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2+ overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2+ homeostasis.\nLoss of TMEM65 causes mitochondrial disease mediated by mitochondrial calcium\nAuthors: Zhang, Y.; Reyes, L.; Sun, J.; Liu, C.; Springer, D.; Noguchi, A. C.; Aponte, A. M.; Munasinghe, J.; Covian, R.; Murphy, E.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.02.502535\nTransmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65) depletion in a patient carrying a homozygous variant in the Tmem65 splice site resulted in severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, indicating the clinical importance of TMEM65. However, the function of TMEM65 remains unknown. Here, we generated a TMEM65 reporter mouse as well as whole-body and tissue-specific Tmem65 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the localization and function of TMEM65. We show that TMEM65 is localized to mitochondria in heart, skeletal muscle, and throughout the brain. Both whole-body and nervous system-specific Tmem65 KO result in severe growth retardation and sudden death following seizures ~3 weeks after birth, indicating TMEM65 is indispensable for normal brain function. In addition, we find that skeletal muscle-specific Tmem65 KO leads to progressive, adult-onset myopathy preceded by elevated mitochondrial calcium levels despite unaltered expression of known mitochondrial or cellular calcium handling proteins. Consistently, we demonstrate that ablation of TMEM65 results in a loss of sodium-dependent mitochondrial calcium export. Finally, we show that blocking mitochondrial calcium entry through removal of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) rescues the early lethality of whole-body TMEM65 ablation. Our data not only reveal the essential role of TMEM65 in mammalian physiology, but also suggest modulating mitochondrial calcium may offer a potential therapeutical approach to address defects associated with TMEM65 misexpression.\nMuscle Bmal1 is necessary for normal transcriptomic and metabolomic adaptation to endurance exercise training.\nAuthors: Viggars, M. R.; Berko, H. E.; Gutierrez Monreal, M. A.; Martin, R. A.; Esser, K. A.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562100\nObjective: The skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined. Methods: Inducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Results: Improvements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units. Conclusions: Collectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.\nEffects of intensified training with insufficient recovery on joint level and single muscle fibre mechanical function: The role of myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity\nAuthors: Roussel, O.; Pignanelli, C.; Hubbard, E.; Coates, A.; Cheng, A.; Burr, J.; Power, G. A.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562290\nIntense exercise training with insufficient recovery is associated with reductions in neuromuscular performance. However, it is unclear how single muscle fibre mechanical function and myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity contribute to these impairments. We investigated the effects of overload training on joint-level neuromuscular performance and cellular-level mechanical function. Fourteen athletes (4 female, 10 male) underwent a 3-week intensified training protocol consisting of ~140% of their regular training hours with three additional high-intensity training sessions per week. Neuromuscular performance of the knee extensors was assessed via maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, electrically evoked twitch contractions, and a force-frequency relationship. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis to assess single fibre mechanical function. Neither MVC force nor twitch parameters were altered following intensified training (all p\u003e0.05), but a rightward shift in the force-frequency curve was observed with a 6-27% reduction in force at low-frequencies (5-20Hz, all p\u003c0.05). In single fibres, maximal force output was not reduced following intensified training, but there was a rightward shift in the force-pCa curve driven by a 6% reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity as indicated by a lower pCa50 value (i.e., higher [Ca2+]) across fibre types (Pre=6.477 +/- 0.157, Post=6.088 +/- 0.480, p\u003c0.05). These data indicate intensified training leads to impaired Ca2+ sensitivity at the single fibre level, which in part explains impaired neuromuscular function at the joint level during lower frequencies of activation. This is an important consideration for athletes, as performance is often assessed at maximal levels of activation, and these underlying impairments in force generation may be less obvious.\nMesenchymal-specific Alms1 knockout in mice recapitulates key metabolic features of Alström Syndrome\nAuthors: McKay, E. J.; Luijten, I.; Weng, X.; Martinez de Morentin, P. B.; De Frutos Gonzalez, E.; Gao, Z.; Kolonin, M. G.; Heisler, L. K.; Semple, R. K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562074\nBackgroundAlstrom Syndrome (AS), a multi-system disease caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, includes obesity with disproportionately severe insulin resistant diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hepatosteatosis. How loss of ALMS1 causes this phenotype is poorly understood, but prior studies have circumstancially implicated impaired adipose tissue expandability. We set out to test this by comparing the metabolic effects of selective Alms1 knockout in mesenchymal cells including preadipocytes to those of global Alms1 knockout. MethodsGlobal Alms1 knockout (KO) mice were generated by crossing floxed Alms1 and CAG-Cre mice. A Pdgfr-Cre driver was used to abrogate Alms1 function selectively in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their descendants, including preadipocytes. We combined metabolic phenotyping of global and Pdgfr+ Alms1-KO mice on a 45% fat diet with measurements of body composition and food intake, and histological analysis of metabolic tissues. ResultsGlobal Alms1 KO caused hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and fatty liver. Pdgfr-cre driven KO of Alms1 (MSC KO) recapitulated insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidaemia in both sexes. Other phenotypes were sexually dimorphic: increased fat mass was only present in female Alms1 MSC KO mice. Hyperphagia was not evident in male Alms1 MSC KO mice, but was found in MSC KO females, despite no neuronal Pdgfr expression. ConclusionsMesenchymal deletion of Alms1 recapitulates the metabolic features of AS, including severe fatty liver. This confirms a key role for Alms1 in the adipose lineage, where its loss is sufficient to cause systemic metabolic effects and damage to remote organs. AS should be regarded as a forme fruste of lipodystrophy. Therapies should prioritise targeting positive energy balance.\nPhysiological stress response of koala joeys to visitors\nAuthors: Pahuja, H.; Bee, I.; Bee, A.; Narayan, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561560\nKoala (Phascolarctos cinereus) joey rescues are increasing over the years, and rehabilitation of a joey requires extensive care, close proximity and handling by humans. These novel environments are likely to present a suite of biotic and abiotic stressors during rehabilitation. In this study, we longitudinally monitored the faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of three koala joeys within the context of potential stressors at the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 92 faecal samples were analysed for FCMs using a polyclonal R4866 cortisol enzyme-immunoassay which has been previously validated in koalas. The iterative baseline method was used to establish FCM profiles of all individuals, and to identify significant peaks in FCM concentrations. Visitor events were identified and confirmed as an acute stressor based on the FCM profiles of the koala joeys. All three koala joeys elicited a significant rise in FCM concentrations after each visitor encounter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the acute stress response of koala joeys to visitors. We recommend that visitor encounters be kept to a minimum, and perhaps avoided altogether especially for joeys that are being rehabilitated to be released back into the wild.\nTransforming the performance of runners with AI-driven training planning and daily adaptivity\nAuthors: Nilsson, L. C.; Sodergard, O.; Rogestedt, J.; Mattsson, C. M.; Larsen, F. J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561160\nBalancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.\nLong chain monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid levels in human milk vary with gestational weight gain\nAuthors: O'Sullivan, A.; Brady, E.; Lafferty, L.; O'Shea, F.; O'Regan, Z.; Meurs, N.; Baldini, M.; Gengatharan, J.; Metallo, C. M.; Wallace, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.561203\nBreastfeeding is an important determinant of infant health and there is immense interest in understanding its metabolite composition so that key beneficial components can be identified. The aim of this research was to measure the fatty acid composition of human milk in an Irish cohort where we examined changes depending on lactation stage and gestational weight gain trajectory. Utilising a chromatography approach optimal for isomer separation, we identified 44 individual fatty acid species via GCMS and showed that monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids(mmBCFAs), C15:0 and C16:1 are lower in women with excess gestational weight gain versus low gestational weight gain. To further explore the potential contribution of the activity of endogenous metabolic pathways to levels of these fatty acids in milk, we administered D2O to C57BL/6J dams fed a purified lard based high fat diet (HFD) or low-fat diet during gestation and quantified the total and de novo synthesized levels of fatty acids in their milk. We found that de novo synthesis over three days can account for between 10 and 50% of mmBCFAs in milk from dams on the low-fat diet dependent on the branched-chain fatty acid species. However, HFD fed mice had significantly decreased de novo synthesized fatty acids in milk resulting in lower total mmBCFAs and medium chain fatty acid levels. Overall, our findings highlight the diverse fatty acid composition of human milk and that human milk mmBCFA levels differ between gestational weight gain phenotypes. In addition, our data indicates that de novo synthesis contributes to mmBCFA levels in mice milk and thus may also be a contributory factor to mmBCFA levels in human milk. Given emerging data indicating mmBCFAs may be beneficial components of milk, this study contributes to our knowledge around the phenotypic factors that may impact their levels.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Biological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes.

Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both.

We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence.

Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages.

Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups.

To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this &#34;900-day rule&#34; we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2&#43;) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2&#43; overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2&#43; efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na&#43;)-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2&#43; efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na&#43;-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2&#43; overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2&#43; stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65) depletion in a patient carrying a homozygous variant in the Tmem65 splice site resulted in severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, indicating the clinical importance of TMEM65. However, the function of TMEM65 remains unknown. Here, we generated a TMEM65 reporter mouse as well as whole-body and tissue-specific Tmem65 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the localization and function of TMEM65. We show that TMEM65 is localized to mitochondria in heart, skeletal muscle, and throughout the brain. Both whole-body and nervous system-specific Tmem65 KO result in severe growth retardation and sudden death following seizures ~3 weeks after birth, indicating TMEM65 is indispensable for normal brain function. In addition, we find that skeletal muscle-specific Tmem65 KO leads to progressive, adult-onset myopathy preceded by elevated mitochondrial calcium levels despite unaltered expression of known mitochondrial or cellular calcium handling proteins. Consistently, we demonstrate that ablation of TMEM65 results in a loss of sodium-dependent mitochondrial calcium export. Finally, we show that blocking mitochondrial calcium entry through removal of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) rescues the early lethality of whole-body TMEM65 ablation. Our data not only reveal the essential role of TMEM65 in mammalian physiology, but also suggest modulating mitochondrial calcium may offer a potential therapeutical approach to address defects associated with TMEM65 misexpression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: The skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined. Methods: Inducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Results: Improvements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units. Conclusions: Collectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intense exercise training with insufficient recovery is associated with reductions in neuromuscular performance. However, it is unclear how single muscle fibre mechanical function and myofibrillar Ca2&#43; sensitivity contribute to these impairments. We investigated the effects of overload training on joint-level neuromuscular performance and cellular-level mechanical function. Fourteen athletes (4 female, 10 male) underwent a 3-week intensified training protocol consisting of ~140% of their regular training hours with three additional high-intensity training sessions per week. Neuromuscular performance of the knee extensors was assessed via maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, electrically evoked twitch contractions, and a force-frequency relationship. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis to assess single fibre mechanical function. Neither MVC force nor twitch parameters were altered following intensified training (all p&gt;0.05), but a rightward shift in the force-frequency curve was observed with a 6-27% reduction in force at low-frequencies (5-20Hz, all p&lt;0.05). In single fibres, maximal force output was not reduced following intensified training, but there was a rightward shift in the force-pCa curve driven by a 6% reduction in Ca2&#43; sensitivity as indicated by a lower pCa50 value (i.e., higher [Ca2&#43;]) across fibre types (Pre=6.477 &#43;/- 0.157, Post=6.088 &#43;/- 0.480, p&lt;0.05). These data indicate intensified training leads to impaired Ca2&#43; sensitivity at the single fibre level, which in part explains impaired neuromuscular function at the joint level during lower frequencies of activation. This is an important consideration for athletes, as performance is often assessed at maximal levels of activation, and these underlying impairments in force generation may be less obvious.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlstrom Syndrome (AS), a multi-system disease caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, includes obesity with disproportionately severe insulin resistant diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hepatosteatosis. How loss of ALMS1 causes this phenotype is poorly understood, but prior studies have circumstancially implicated impaired adipose tissue expandability. We set out to test this by comparing the metabolic effects of selective Alms1 knockout in mesenchymal cells including preadipocytes to those of global Alms1 knockout.

MethodsGlobal Alms1 knockout (KO) mice were generated by crossing floxed Alms1 and CAG-Cre mice. A Pdgfr-Cre driver was used to abrogate Alms1 function selectively in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their descendants, including preadipocytes. We combined metabolic phenotyping of global and Pdgfr&#43; Alms1-KO mice on a 45% fat diet with measurements of body composition and food intake, and histological analysis of metabolic tissues.

ResultsGlobal Alms1 KO caused hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and fatty liver. Pdgfr-cre driven KO of Alms1 (MSC KO) recapitulated insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidaemia in both sexes. Other phenotypes were sexually dimorphic: increased fat mass was only present in female Alms1 MSC KO mice. Hyperphagia was not evident in male Alms1 MSC KO mice, but was found in MSC KO females, despite no neuronal Pdgfr expression.

ConclusionsMesenchymal deletion of Alms1 recapitulates the metabolic features of AS, including severe fatty liver. This confirms a key role for Alms1 in the adipose lineage, where its loss is sufficient to cause systemic metabolic effects and damage to remote organs. AS should be regarded as a forme fruste of lipodystrophy. Therapies should prioritise targeting positive energy balance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) joey rescues are increasing over the years, and rehabilitation of a joey requires extensive care, close proximity and handling by humans. These novel environments are likely to present a suite of biotic and abiotic stressors during rehabilitation. In this study, we longitudinally monitored the faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of three koala joeys within the context of potential stressors at the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 92 faecal samples were analysed for FCMs using a polyclonal R4866 cortisol enzyme-immunoassay which has been previously validated in koalas. The iterative baseline method was used to establish FCM profiles of all individuals, and to identify significant peaks in FCM concentrations. Visitor events were identified and confirmed as an acute stressor based on the FCM profiles of the koala joeys. All three koala joeys elicited a significant rise in FCM concentrations after each visitor encounter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the acute stress response of koala joeys to visitors. We recommend that visitor encounters be kept to a minimum, and perhaps avoided altogether especially for joeys that are being rehabilitated to be released back into the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Balancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Breastfeeding is an important determinant of infant health and there is immense interest in understanding its metabolite composition so that key beneficial components can be identified. The aim of this research was to measure the fatty acid composition of human milk in an Irish cohort where we examined changes depending on lactation stage and gestational weight gain trajectory. Utilising a chromatography approach optimal for isomer separation, we identified 44 individual fatty acid species via GCMS and showed that monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids(mmBCFAs), C15:0 and C16:1 are lower in women with excess gestational weight gain versus low gestational weight gain. To further explore the potential contribution of the activity of endogenous metabolic pathways to levels of these fatty acids in milk, we administered D2O to C57BL/6J dams fed a purified lard based high fat diet (HFD) or low-fat diet during gestation and quantified the total and de novo synthesized levels of fatty acids in their milk. We found that de novo synthesis over three days can account for between 10 and 50% of mmBCFAs in milk from dams on the low-fat diet dependent on the branched-chain fatty acid species. However, HFD fed mice had significantly decreased de novo synthesized fatty acids in milk resulting in lower total mmBCFAs and medium chain fatty acid levels. Overall, our findings highlight the diverse fatty acid composition of human milk and that human milk mmBCFA levels differ between gestational weight gain phenotypes. In addition, our data indicates that de novo synthesis contributes to mmBCFA levels in mice milk and thus may also be a contributory factor to mmBCFA levels in human milk. Given emerging data indicating mmBCFAs may be beneficial components of milk, this study contributes to our knowledge around the phenotypic factors that may impact their levels.</p>
