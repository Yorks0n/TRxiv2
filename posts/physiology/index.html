Ozanne, S.; Peffers, M. J.; Jackson, M. J.; Goljanek-Whysall, K.; Vasilaki, A.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559536\nThe early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.\nDifferential utilisation of subcellular skeletal muscle glycogen pools: A comparative analysis between 1 and 15 minutes of maximal exercise\nAuthors: Schytz, C. T.; Ortenblad, N.; Gejl, K. D.; Nielsen, J.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559993\nDistinct subcellular pools of glycogen particles exist within skeletal muscle fibres, distributed both within and between myofibrils and can be found in proximity to, or at a distance from mitochondria. Their precise localisation may influence their degradation rate and role in muscle function. Here, we investigated how exercise at different intensities (1- and 15-min maximal exercise) with known variations in glycogenolytic rate and relative contribution from anaerobic metabolism affects the utilisation of the distinct pools. Further, we investigated how lowered carbohydrate and energy intake affected glycogen volume densities and the storage of glycogen particles (i.e., localisation, size, and number) and their subsequent utilisation during the exercises. Using a randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, participants performed two maximal cycle tests of either 1 (n=10) or 15 min (n=10), conducted following consumption of two distinct diets with either high or lowered carbohydrate and energy contents. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained before and after the exercises. Intermyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 1-min exercise, whereas intramyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 15-min exercise. The lowered carbohydrate and energy intake decreased the particle size across all subcellular pools and reduced the numerical density in the intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal pools, with no effects on the glycogen utilisation during the subsequent exercise. In conclusion, the distinct subcellular glycogen pools were differentially utilised during 1-min and 15-min maximal exercise. Additionally, lowered carbohydrate and energy consumption reduces particle size and numerical density, depending on subcellular localisation.\nAstrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux maintaining brain homeostasis\nAuthors: Pham, C.; Komaki, Y.; Deas-Just, A.; Le Gac, B.; Mouffle, C.; Franco, C.; Vialou, V.; Tsurugizawa, T.; Cauli, B.; Li, D.\nScore: 3.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560471\nBrain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiberphotometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2+ signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.\nSympathetic Motor Neuron Dysfunction is a Missing Link in Age-Associated Sympathetic Overactivity\nAuthors: de la Cruz, L.; Bui, D.; Moreno, C. M.; Vivas, O.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559800\nOveractivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. Additionally, we assessed whether rapamycin, an anti-aging treatment, reverses the age-related changes in sympathetic motor neurons. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of KCNQ channel currents emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. The administration of rapamycin in food for 12 weeks in middle-aged mice partially reverted the KCNQ current reduction and hyperexcitability associated with age. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity. Further, our data suggest that rapamycin's beneficial anti-aging effects may be partly attributed to its potential to impact sympathetic nervous system components, providing novel insights into therapeutic strategies for age-related conditions.\nInhibition of mammalian mtDNA transcription paradoxically activates liver fatty acid oxidation to reverse diet-induced hepatosteatosis and obesity\nAuthors: Jiang, S.; Yuan, T.; Kremer, L. S.; Rosenberger, F. A.; Hansen, F. M.; Borg, M.; Rubalcava-Gracia, D.; Mennuni, M.; Filograna, R.; Alsina, D.; Misic, J.; Koolmeister, C.; Ren, L.; Andersson, O.; Unger, A.; Bergbrede, T.; Lucrezia, R. D.; Wilbom, R.; Zierath, J. R.; Krook, A.; Giavalisco, P.; Mann, M.; Larsson, N.-G.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558955\nThe oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.\nHuman proton channels accumulate in cholesterol dependent membrane domains via direct interaction with stomatin\nAuthors: Ayuyan, A. G.; Cherny, V. V.; Chaves, G.; Musset, B.; Cohen, F. S.; DeCoursey, T. E.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560017\nMany membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we report strong effects of cholesterol depletion and restoration on the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1 in excised patches but negligible effects in whole-cell configuration. Despite the presence of a putative cholesterol binding site, a CARC domain in the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1, mutation of this domain did not affect cholesterol effects. The murine HV1 lacks a CARC sequence but displays similar cholesterol effects. These three results all argue against a direct effect of cholesterol on HV1. We propose that the data are explainable if HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains, or rafts. The rafts would be expected to concentrate in the membrane/glass interface and to be depleted from the electrically-accessible patch membrane. This idea is supported by evidence that HV1 channels can diffuse between seal and patch membranes when suction is applied. Suction pulls membrane constituents including HV1 into the patch. In whole-cell studies moderate osmotic stretch does not noticeably alter H+ currents. Simultaneous truncation of the large intracellular N- and C- termini greatly attenuated the cholesterol effect, but C-truncation only did not. We conclude that the N-terminus is the region of attachment to lipid domains. Searching for abundant raft-associated molecules led to stomatin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that hHV1 binds to stomatin. The stomatin-mediated association of HV1 with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains provides a mechanism for cells to direct HV1 to subcellular location where it is needed, such as the phagosome in leukocytes.\nQuantitative Profiling Method for Oxylipins in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry\nAuthors: Pourmand, E.; Zhang, F.; Sarparast, M.; Alan, J. K.; Lee, K. S. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560544\nAging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges. In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.\nBeneficial metabolic effects of PAHSAs depend on the gut microbiota in diet-induced obese mice\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Wellenstein, K.; Rahnavard, A.; Nelson, A. T.; Holter, M.; Cummings, B. P.; Yeliseyev, V.; Castoldi, A.; Clish, C. B.; Bry, L.; Siegel, D.; Kahn, B. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.558803\nDietary lipids play an essential role in regulating the function of the gut microbiota and gastrointestinal tract, and these luminal interactions contribute to mediating host metabolism. PAHSAs are a class of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether the gut microbiome contributes to their beneficial effects on host metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that treating high fat diet (HFD)-fed germ-free mice with PAHSAs does not improve insulin sensitivity. However, transfer of feces from PAHSA-treated, but not Vehicle-treated, chow-fed mice increases insulin-sensitivity in HFD-fed germ free mice. Thus, the gut microbiota is necessary for and can transmit the insulin-sensitizing effects of PAHSAs in HFD-fed germ-free mice. Functional analyses of the cecal metagenome and lipidome of PAHSA-treated mice identified multiple lipid species that associate with the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and with insulin sensitivity resulting from PAHSA treatment. Bt supplementation in HFD-fed female mice prevented weight gain, reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, fortified the colonic mucus barrier and reduced systemic inflammation versus chow-fed controls, effects that were not observed in HFD-fed male mice. Furthermore, ovariectomy partially reversed the beneficial Bt effects on host metabolism, indicating a role for sex hormones in mediating probiotic effects. Altogether, these studies highlight the fact that lipids can modulate the gut microbiota resulting in improvement in host metabolism and that PAHSA-induced changes in the microbiota result in at least some of their insulin-sensitizing effects in female mice.\nFetal Membrane Inflammasome Activation by Choriodecidual Ureaplasma parvum Infection without Intra-Amniotic Infection in an NHP Model\nAuthors: Tripathy, S.; Burd, I.; Kelleher, M. A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.557989\nIntrauterine infection is a significant cause of preterm labor and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Ureaplasma parvum is the micro-organism most commonly isolated from cases of preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM). However, the mechanisms during the early stages of ascending reproductive tract infection that initiate maternal-fetal inflammatory pathways, preterm birth and pPROM remain poorly understood. To examine inflammation in fetal (chorioamnionic) membranes in response to Ureaplasma parvum infection, we utilized a novel in vivo non-human primate model of early choriodecidual infection. Eight chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus macaques underwent maternal-fetal catheterization surgery at 105-112 days gestation and choriodecidual inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum (105cfu/mL of a low passaged clinical isolate, serovar 1; n=4) or saline/sterile media (Controls; n=4) starting at 115-119 days gestation, repeated every 5 days until scheduled cesarean-section at 136-140d gestation (term=167d). The average inoculation to delivery interval was 21 days and Ureaplasma infection of the amniotic fluid was undetectable by culture and PCR in all animals. Inflammatory mediators in amniotic fluid (AF) were assessed by Luminex, ELISA and multiplex assays. RNA was extracted from the chorion and amnionic membranes for single gene analysis (qRT-PCR) and protein expression was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our NHP model of choriodecidual Ureaplasma infection, representing an early-stage ascending reproductive tract infection without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, resulted in increased fetal membrane protein and gene expression of MMP-9 and PTGS2, but did not result in preterm labor (no increase in uterine contractility) or increased concentrations of amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-). However, membrane expression of inflammasome sensor molecules, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and NOD2, and the adaptor protein ASC (PYCARD) gene expression were significantly increased in the Ureaplasma group when compared to non-infected controls. Gene expression of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, the IL-18R1 receptor, CASPASE-1 and pro-CASPASE-1 protein were also increased in the fetal membranes with Ureaplasma infection. Downstream inflammatory signaling genes MYD88 was also significantly upregulated in both the amnion and chorion, along with a significant increase in NFKB in the chorion. These results demonstrate that even at the early stages of ascending reproductive tract Ureaplasma infection, activation of inflammasome complexes and pathways associated with degradation of chorioamnionic membrane integrity are present. This study therefore provides experimental evidence for the importance of the early stages of ascending Ureaplasma infection in initiating processes of pPROM and preterm labor. These findings have implications for the identification of intrauterine inflammation before microbes are detectable in the amniotic fluid (sterile inflammation) and the timing of potential treatments for preterm labor and fetal injury caused by intrauterine infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The early life environment significantly affects the development of age-related skeletal muscle disorders. However, the long-term effects of lactational protein restriction on skeletal muscle are still poorly defined. Our study revealed that male mice nursed by dams fed a low-protein diet during lactation exhibited skeletal muscle growth restriction. This was associated with a dysregulation in the expression levels of genes related to the ribosome, mitochondria and skeletal muscle development. We reported that lifelong protein restriction accelerated loss of type-IIa muscle fibres and reduced muscle fibre size by impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis at 18 months of age. However, feeding a normal-protein diet following lactational protein restriction prevented accelerated fibre loss and fibre size reduction in later life. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which lactational protein restriction hinders skeletal muscle growth and includes evidence that lifelong dietary protein restriction accelerated skeletal muscle loss in later life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Distinct subcellular pools of glycogen particles exist within skeletal muscle fibres, distributed both within and between myofibrils and can be found in proximity to, or at a distance from mitochondria. Their precise localisation may influence their degradation rate and role in muscle function. Here, we investigated how exercise at different intensities (1- and 15-min maximal exercise) with known variations in glycogenolytic rate and relative contribution from anaerobic metabolism affects the utilisation of the distinct pools. Further, we investigated how lowered carbohydrate and energy intake affected glycogen volume densities and the storage of glycogen particles (i.e., localisation, size, and number) and their subsequent utilisation during the exercises. Using a randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design, participants performed two maximal cycle tests of either 1 (n=10) or 15 min (n=10), conducted following consumption of two distinct diets with either high or lowered carbohydrate and energy contents. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis were obtained before and after the exercises. Intermyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 1-min exercise, whereas intramyofibrillar glycogen was preferentially utilised during the 15-min exercise. The lowered carbohydrate and energy intake decreased the particle size across all subcellular pools and reduced the numerical density in the intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal pools, with no effects on the glycogen utilisation during the subsequent exercise. In conclusion, the distinct subcellular glycogen pools were differentially utilised during 1-min and 15-min maximal exercise. Additionally, lowered carbohydrate and energy consumption reduces particle size and numerical density, depending on subcellular localisation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiberphotometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2&#43; signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. Additionally, we assessed whether rapamycin, an anti-aging treatment, reverses the age-related changes in sympathetic motor neurons. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of KCNQ channel currents emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. The administration of rapamycin in food for 12 weeks in middle-aged mice partially reverted the KCNQ current reduction and hyperexcitability associated with age. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity. Further, our data suggest that rapamycin&#39;s beneficial anti-aging effects may be partly attributed to its potential to impact sympathetic nervous system components, providing novel insights into therapeutic strategies for age-related conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we report strong effects of cholesterol depletion and restoration on the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1 in excised patches but negligible effects in whole-cell configuration. Despite the presence of a putative cholesterol binding site, a CARC domain in the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1, mutation of this domain did not affect cholesterol effects. The murine HV1 lacks a CARC sequence but displays similar cholesterol effects. These three results all argue against a direct effect of cholesterol on HV1. We propose that the data are explainable if HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains, or rafts. The rafts would be expected to concentrate in the membrane/glass interface and to be depleted from the electrically-accessible patch membrane. This idea is supported by evidence that HV1 channels can diffuse between seal and patch membranes when suction is applied. Suction pulls membrane constituents including HV1 into the patch. In whole-cell studies moderate osmotic stretch does not noticeably alter H&#43; currents. Simultaneous truncation of the large intracellular N- and C- termini greatly attenuated the cholesterol effect, but C-truncation only did not. We conclude that the N-terminus is the region of attachment to lipid domains. Searching for abundant raft-associated molecules led to stomatin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that hHV1 binds to stomatin. The stomatin-mediated association of HV1 with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains provides a mechanism for cells to direct HV1 to subcellular location where it is needed, such as the phagosome in leukocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is one of the major risk factors for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, neuropathy, hypertension, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism behind aging and how aging affects a variety of disease progression remains unknown. Recent research demonstrated the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxide hydrolase (EH) metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in the abovementioned age-associated diseases. Therefore, aging could affect the abovementioned chronic diseases by modulating CYP-EH PUFA metabolism. Unfortunately, investigating how aging affects CYP-EH metabolism in human and mammalian models poses significant challenges. In this regard, we will use C. elegans as a model organism to investigate the aging effects on CYP-EH metabolism of PUFA, owing to its long history of being used to study aging and its associated benefits of conducting aging research. This project will develop analytical tools to measure the endogenous levels of CYP-EH PUFA metabolites in C. elegans using state-of-the-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These metabolites are very potent but present in low abundance. The dramatic increase in sensitivity in UPLC-MS/MS allows us to monitor these metabolites over the lifespan of C. elegans with minimum samples. Our results show that C. elegans produces similar CYP PUFA metabolites to mammals and humans using our SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method. We will also show that our method successfully determined the CYP-EH PUFA metabolites profile changes induced by the inhibition of C. elegans EH. The method developed from this project will significantly improve our understanding of the role of dietary PUFAs and associated metabolism on aging and neurodegeneration and will uncover new mechanisms of how aging affects neurodegeneration through the modulation of PUFA metabolic pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary lipids play an essential role in regulating the function of the gut microbiota and gastrointestinal tract, and these luminal interactions contribute to mediating host metabolism. PAHSAs are a class of lipids with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, but whether the gut microbiome contributes to their beneficial effects on host metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that treating high fat diet (HFD)-fed germ-free mice with PAHSAs does not improve insulin sensitivity. However, transfer of feces from PAHSA-treated, but not Vehicle-treated, chow-fed mice increases insulin-sensitivity in HFD-fed germ free mice. Thus, the gut microbiota is necessary for and can transmit the insulin-sensitizing effects of PAHSAs in HFD-fed germ-free mice. Functional analyses of the cecal metagenome and lipidome of PAHSA-treated mice identified multiple lipid species that associate with the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and with insulin sensitivity resulting from PAHSA treatment. Bt supplementation in HFD-fed female mice prevented weight gain, reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, fortified the colonic mucus barrier and reduced systemic inflammation versus chow-fed controls, effects that were not observed in HFD-fed male mice. Furthermore, ovariectomy partially reversed the beneficial Bt effects on host metabolism, indicating a role for sex hormones in mediating probiotic effects. Altogether, these studies highlight the fact that lipids can modulate the gut microbiota resulting in improvement in host metabolism and that PAHSA-induced changes in the microbiota result in at least some of their insulin-sensitizing effects in female mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intrauterine infection is a significant cause of preterm labor and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Ureaplasma parvum is the micro-organism most commonly isolated from cases of preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM). However, the mechanisms during the early stages of ascending reproductive tract infection that initiate maternal-fetal inflammatory pathways, preterm birth and pPROM remain poorly understood. To examine inflammation in fetal (chorioamnionic) membranes in response to Ureaplasma parvum infection, we utilized a novel in vivo non-human primate model of early choriodecidual infection. Eight chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus macaques underwent maternal-fetal catheterization surgery at 105-112 days gestation and choriodecidual inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum (105cfu/mL of a low passaged clinical isolate, serovar 1; n=4) or saline/sterile media (Controls; n=4) starting at 115-119 days gestation, repeated every 5 days until scheduled cesarean-section at 136-140d gestation (term=167d). The average inoculation to delivery interval was 21 days and Ureaplasma infection of the amniotic fluid was undetectable by culture and PCR in all animals. Inflammatory mediators in amniotic fluid (AF) were assessed by Luminex, ELISA and multiplex assays. RNA was extracted from the chorion and amnionic membranes for single gene analysis (qRT-PCR) and protein expression was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our NHP model of choriodecidual Ureaplasma infection, representing an early-stage ascending reproductive tract infection without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, resulted in increased fetal membrane protein and gene expression of MMP-9 and PTGS2, but did not result in preterm labor (no increase in uterine contractility) or increased concentrations of amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-). However, membrane expression of inflammasome sensor molecules, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and NOD2, and the adaptor protein ASC (PYCARD) gene expression were significantly increased in the Ureaplasma group when compared to non-infected controls. Gene expression of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, the IL-18R1 receptor, CASPASE-1 and pro-CASPASE-1 protein were also increased in the fetal membranes with Ureaplasma infection. Downstream inflammatory signaling genes MYD88 was also significantly upregulated in both the amnion and chorion, along with a significant increase in NFKB in the chorion. These results demonstrate that even at the early stages of ascending reproductive tract Ureaplasma infection, activation of inflammasome complexes and pathways associated with degradation of chorioamnionic membrane integrity are present. This study therefore provides experimental evidence for the importance of the early stages of ascending Ureaplasma infection in initiating processes of pPROM and preterm labor. These findings have implications for the identification of intrauterine inflammation before microbes are detectable in the amniotic fluid (sterile inflammation) and the timing of potential treatments for preterm labor and fetal injury caused by intrauterine infection.</p>
