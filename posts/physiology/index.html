Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.\nMuscle fibre size and myonuclear positioning in trained and aged humans\nAuthors: Battey, E.; Levy, Y.; Pollock, R. D.; Pugh, J. N.; Close, G. L.; Kalakoutis, M.; Lazarus, N. R.; Harridge, S. R.; Ochala, J.; Stroud, M. J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.551292\nMyonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (m2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P \u003c 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Plain Language SummaryIn this study, we examined the relationship between physical activity and the characteristics of muscle fibres in individuals of different age groups. We focused on a concept called the myonuclear domain (MND), which refers to the volume surrounding muscle nuclei or myonuclei that house the genome. We wanted to understand how changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and MND size were influenced by exercise and aging. To do this, we compared muscle fibres from younger trained individuals, older trained individuals, and age-matched untrained individuals. The results showed that the average size of muscle fibres in the untrained older individuals was smaller compared to the other groups. Moreover, the number of nuclei relative to fibre size was significantly higher in the untrained older individuals. However, myonuclear arrangement was similar across all groups. These findings suggest that regular endurance exercise throughout life may help maintain muscle fibre size, myonuclear numbers, MND volumes, and myonuclear organisation in older individuals. Conversely, inactivity can lead to reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. These results have important implications for understanding the effects of exercise and aging on muscle health.\nElephants develop wrinkles through both form \u0026 function\nAuthors: Schulz, A. K.; Kaufmann, L.; Reveyaz, N.; Ritter, C.; Hildebrandt, T.; Brecht, M. K.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554618\nElephant trunks have folds and wrinkles, but we dont know how wrinkles differ between elephant species and how trunks and their wrinkles develop. Adult Asian elephants have significantly more dorsal major trunk wrinkles ([~]126 {+/-} 25 SD) than African elephants ([~]83 {+/-} 13 SD). There are more dorsal than ventral major trunk wrinkles and there is a closer wrinkle spacing distally than proximally. Wrinkle numbers differed slightly as a function of trunk-lateralization. MicroCT-imaging revealed a relatively constant thickness of the outer elephant trunk skin, whereas the inner skin parts are thicker between folds than in folds. The trunk shows the greatest fetal length growth of elephant body parts. Trunk wrinkles are added in an early exponential phase, where wrinkles double every 20 days, and a later phase, where wrinkles are added slowly and at a faster rate in Asian compared to African elephants. We suggest wrinkles improve the ability of trunk skin to bend.\nContributions of individual satellite cells to muscle regeneration assessed using a confetti mouse model\nAuthors: Heemskerk, H.; Jagannathan, N. S.; Nasir, N. J. M.; Nguyen, B. P.; Sacadevan, K.; Matsudaira, P.; So, P. T.; Tucker-Kellogg, L.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554761\nInsufficient regeneration is implicated in muscle pathologies, but much remains unknown about the regenerative output of individual muscle stem cells, called satellite cells (SCs). Prior work showed that individual SCs contribute to regeneration of more than one muscle fiber (\"fiber-crossing\") after full-muscle damage. We investigated whether fiber-crossing also occurred in peripheral regions of a localized muscle injury. To assess fiber-crossing with a minimum number of mice, we used lineage tracing with confetti fluorescence, and developed a novel stochastic modeling method to interpret the ambiguity of multi-color fluorescent lineage tags. Microscopy of the regenerated muscle showed that adjacent fibers often expressed the same-colored tags. Computational analysis concluded that the observed color patches would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance unless SCs contributed myonuclei to multiple adjacent fibers (26-33% of SCs contributing to at most 1-2 additional fibers). Interestingly, these results were similar across the different regions studied, suggesting that severe destruction is not required for fiber-crossing. Our method to assess fiber-crossing may be useful for future study of gene and cell therapies that use fiber-crossing to aid muscle regeneration.\nIntermittent fasting promotes ILC3s secreting IL-22 contributing to the beigeing of white adipose tissue\nAuthors: Zhang, W.; Yin, Y.; Chen, H.; Sun, L.; Feng, L.; Han, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhai, W.; Zhang, Z.; Mulholland, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555436\nMechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.\nMyostatin is a major endocrine driver of follicle-stimulating hormone synthesis\nAuthors: Ongaro, L.; Zhou, X.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, Z.; Schultz, H.; Buddle, E. R. S.; Brule, E.; Lin, Y.-F.; Schang, G.; Castonguay, R.; Liu, Y.; Su, G. H.; Seidah, N.; Ray, K. C.; Karp, S. J.; Boehm, U.; Lee, S.-J.; Bernard, D. J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555595\nMyostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. Here, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone directly promoting pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor {beta} family, the activins. The results both challenge activin's eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. The data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to treat muscle wasting disorders may have unintended consequences on fertility.\nOptoPI3K, genetic code expansion, and click chemistry reveal mechanisms underlying reciprocal regulation between TRPV1 and PI3K\nAuthors: Koh, D.-S.; Stratiievska, A.; Jana, S.; Otto, S. C.; Swanson, T. M.; Nhim, A.; Carlson, S.; Raza, M.; Naves, L. A.; Senning, E. N.; Mehl, R.; Gordon, S. E.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555449\nReceptor tyrosine kinase signaling is characterized by complex webs of interconnected pathways that regulate diverse cellular functions. The complexity of signaling is a barrier to understanding the pathways that control any particular function. In this work, we use a novel combination of approaches and a new click chemistry probe to determine the role of one pathway in regulating cell surface expression of an ion channel and a receptor tyrosine kinase. We applied an optogenetic approach to uncouple activation of the PI3K pathway from other pathways downstream of RTK activation. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the PM in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.\nNa+/K+ATPase - Cav1.2 nanodomain differentially regulates intracellular and local adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes\nAuthors: Karbowski, M.; Boyman, L.; Garber, L.; Joca, H.; Verhoeven, N.; Coleman, A. K.; Ward, C.; Lederer, W. J.; Greiser, M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.553598\nBackground: The intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is a crucial but understudied regulator of cardiac myocyte function. The Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) controls the steady-state [Na+]i and thereby determines the set-point for intracellular Ca2+. Here, we investigate the nanoscopic organization and local adrenergic regulation of the NKA macromolecular complex and how it differentially regulates the intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ homeostases in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Methods: Multicolor STORM super-resolution microscopy, Western Blot analyses, and in vivo examination of adrenergic regulation are employed to examine the organization and function of Na+ nanodomains in cardiac myocytes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution is used in conjunction with cellular electrophysiology to investigate intracellular Na+ homeostasis in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Results: The NKA1 (NKA1) and the L-type Ca2+-channel (Cav1.2) form a nanodomain with a center-to center distance of ~65 nm in both ventricular and atrial myocytes. NKA1 protein expression levels are ~3 fold higher in atria compared to ventricle. 100% higher atrial INKA, produced by large NKA \"superclusters\", underlies the substantially lower Na+ concentration in atrial myocytes compared to the benchmark values set in ventricular myocytes. The NKA's regulatory protein phospholemman (PLM) has similar expression levels across atria and ventricle resulting in a much lower PLM/NKA1 ratio for atrial compared to ventricular tissue. In addition, a huge PLM phosphorylation reserve in atrial tissue produces a high {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity of INKA in atrial myocytes. {beta}-adrenergic regulation of INKA is locally mediated in the NKA1-Cav1.2 nanodomain via A-kinase anchoring proteins. Conclusions: NKA1, Cav1.2 and their accessory proteins form a structural and regulatory nanodomain at the cardiac dyad. The tissue-specific composition and local adrenergic regulation of this \"signaling cloud\" is a main regulator of the distinct global intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations in atrial and ventricular myocytes.\nSedentary behavior may accelerate aging through impact on epigenome and transcriptome: lessons from muscle inactivation in Drosophila larvae\nAuthors: Brener, A.; Lorber, D.; Reuveny, A.; Toledano, H.; Porat-Kuperstein, L.; Lebenthal, Y.; Weizman, E.; Olender, T.; Volk, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555053\nAimThe biological mechanisms linking sedentary lifestyles and metabolic derangements are incompletely understood. Our animal model mimics sedentary behavior during early life, enabling us to explore the associated chromatin epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes. MethodsDrosophila larvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the shibire1 (shi) gene were used. shi homozygous mutant larvae undergo instant arrest of muscle contraction at a restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C), without affecting other systems. Both shi and control (y,w) larvae were held at permissive temperature (18{degrees}C), and transferred to restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C) for six hours. Larvae were then dissected, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies specific for epigenetic marks of chromatin activation (H3K9ac) and repression (H3K27me3), and their fluorescence signal was quantified. In addition, whole genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA in muscle-specific inactive, or control larvae was performed using muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol. ResultsInducing muscle inactivity in shi larvae at 300C yielded a significantly higher ratio between chromatin activation and repression, based upon H3K9ac/H3K27me3 signals (p=0.025), relative to all control groups for which this ratio was comparable (p=0.995). Furthermore, muscle inactivation led to altered Pol II binding to 121 out of 2010 genes (6%). The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. In addition, a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs was noted in the muscle-inactive larvae. ConclusionInducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin, triggering an altered epigenetic balance, as well as downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes essential for muscle function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity and others. Extrapolating these findings to humans holds promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases.\nMyosin in autoinhibited off state(s), stabilized by mavacamten, can be recruited via inotropic effectors\nAuthors: Ma, W.; del Rio, C. L.; Qi, L.; Prodanovic, M.; Mijailovich, S.; Zambataro, C.; Gong, H.; Shimkunas, R.; Gollapudi, S.; Nag, S.; Irving, T.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.10.536292\nMavacamten is a novel, FDA-approved, small molecule therapeutic designed to regulate cardiac function by selectively but reversibly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin. It shifts myosin towards ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone. It remains unresolved whether mavacamten permanently sequesters these myosin heads in the off state(s) or whether these heads can be recruited in response to physiological stimuli when required to boost cardiac output. We show that cardiac myosins stabilized in these off state(s) by mavacamten are recruitable by Ca2+, increased heart rate, stretch, and {beta}-adrenergic ({beta}-AR) stimulation, all known physiological inotropic effectors. At the molecular level, we show that, in presence of mavacamten, Ca2+ increases myosin ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from the reserve super-relaxed (SRX) state to the active disordered relaxed (DRX) state. At the myofilament level, both Ca2+ and passive lengthening can shift ordered off myosin heads from positions close to the thick filament backbone to disordered on states closer to the thin filaments in the presence of mavacamten. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, increased stimulation rates enhanced shortening fraction in mavacamten-treated cells. This observation was confirmed in vivo in telemetered rats, where left-ventricular dP/dtmax, an index of inotropy, increased with heart rate in mavacamten treated animals. Finally, we show that {beta}-AR stimulation in vivo increases left-ventricular function and stroke volume in the setting of mavacamten. Our data demonstrate that the mavacamten-promoted off states of myosin in the thick filament are activable, at least partially, thus leading to preservation of cardiac reserve mechanisms. Significance statementMavacamten is the first myosin-targeted small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA to treat obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by attenuating myocardial hyperdynamic contraction. The recruitment of cardiac contractility is, however, vital to ensure sufficient cardiac output during increased physiological demand. Here we show that major inotropic effectors are at least partially preserved in the setting of mavacamten, resulting in maintenance of cardiac reserve mechanisms. These results not only suggest an alternative mechanistic explanation, beyond mere LV outflow tract obstruction removal, for the clinically observed increase in peak oxygen uptake with exercise in HCM patients receiving mavacamten, but also lay the groundwork for a potential methodology to investigate the sarcomeric basis of chronotropic incompetence in disease states to motivate new therapeutic interventions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (m2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes.

Plain Language SummaryIn this study, we examined the relationship between physical activity and the characteristics of muscle fibres in individuals of different age groups. We focused on a concept called the myonuclear domain (MND), which refers to the volume surrounding muscle nuclei or myonuclei that house the genome. We wanted to understand how changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and MND size were influenced by exercise and aging. To do this, we compared muscle fibres from younger trained individuals, older trained individuals, and age-matched untrained individuals. The results showed that the average size of muscle fibres in the untrained older individuals was smaller compared to the other groups. Moreover, the number of nuclei relative to fibre size was significantly higher in the untrained older individuals. However, myonuclear arrangement was similar across all groups. These findings suggest that regular endurance exercise throughout life may help maintain muscle fibre size, myonuclear numbers, MND volumes, and myonuclear organisation in older individuals. Conversely, inactivity can lead to reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. These results have important implications for understanding the effects of exercise and aging on muscle health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Elephant trunks have folds and wrinkles, but we dont know how wrinkles differ between elephant species and how trunks and their wrinkles develop. Adult Asian elephants have significantly more dorsal major trunk wrinkles ([~]126 {&#43;/-} 25 SD) than African elephants ([~]83 {&#43;/-} 13 SD). There are more dorsal than ventral major trunk wrinkles and there is a closer wrinkle spacing distally than proximally. Wrinkle numbers differed slightly as a function of trunk-lateralization. MicroCT-imaging revealed a relatively constant thickness of the outer elephant trunk skin, whereas the inner skin parts are thicker between folds than in folds. The trunk shows the greatest fetal length growth of elephant body parts. Trunk wrinkles are added in an early exponential phase, where wrinkles double every 20 days, and a later phase, where wrinkles are added slowly and at a faster rate in Asian compared to African elephants. We suggest wrinkles improve the ability of trunk skin to bend.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insufficient regeneration is implicated in muscle pathologies, but much remains unknown about the regenerative output of individual muscle stem cells, called satellite cells (SCs). Prior work showed that individual SCs contribute to regeneration of more than one muscle fiber (&#34;fiber-crossing&#34;) after full-muscle damage. We investigated whether fiber-crossing also occurred in peripheral regions of a localized muscle injury. To assess fiber-crossing with a minimum number of mice, we used lineage tracing with confetti fluorescence, and developed a novel stochastic modeling method to interpret the ambiguity of multi-color fluorescent lineage tags. Microscopy of the regenerated muscle showed that adjacent fibers often expressed the same-colored tags. Computational analysis concluded that the observed color patches would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance unless SCs contributed myonuclei to multiple adjacent fibers (26-33% of SCs contributing to at most 1-2 additional fibers). Interestingly, these results were similar across the different regions studied, suggesting that severe destruction is not required for fiber-crossing. Our method to assess fiber-crossing may be useful for future study of gene and cell therapies that use fiber-crossing to aid muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. Here, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone directly promoting pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor {beta} family, the activins. The results both challenge activin&#39;s eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. The data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to treat muscle wasting disorders may have unintended consequences on fertility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is characterized by complex webs of interconnected pathways that regulate diverse cellular functions. The complexity of signaling is a barrier to understanding the pathways that control any particular function. In this work, we use a novel combination of approaches and a new click chemistry probe to determine the role of one pathway in regulating cell surface expression of an ion channel and a receptor tyrosine kinase. We applied an optogenetic approach to uncouple activation of the PI3K pathway from other pathways downstream of RTK activation. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the PM in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The intracellular Na&#43; concentration ([Na&#43;]i) is a crucial but understudied regulator of cardiac myocyte function. The Na&#43;/K&#43; ATPase (NKA) controls the steady-state [Na&#43;]i and thereby determines the set-point for intracellular Ca2&#43;. Here, we investigate the nanoscopic organization and local adrenergic regulation of the NKA macromolecular complex and how it differentially regulates the intracellular Na&#43; and Ca2&#43; homeostases in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Methods: Multicolor STORM super-resolution microscopy, Western Blot analyses, and in vivo examination of adrenergic regulation are employed to examine the organization and function of Na&#43; nanodomains in cardiac myocytes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution is used in conjunction with cellular electrophysiology to investigate intracellular Na&#43; homeostasis in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Results: The NKA1 (NKA1) and the L-type Ca2&#43;-channel (Cav1.2) form a nanodomain with a center-to center distance of ~65 nm in both ventricular and atrial myocytes. NKA1 protein expression levels are ~3 fold higher in atria compared to ventricle. 100% higher atrial INKA, produced by large NKA &#34;superclusters&#34;, underlies the substantially lower Na&#43; concentration in atrial myocytes compared to the benchmark values set in ventricular myocytes. The NKA&#39;s regulatory protein phospholemman (PLM) has similar expression levels across atria and ventricle resulting in a much lower PLM/NKA1 ratio for atrial compared to ventricular tissue. In addition, a huge PLM phosphorylation reserve in atrial tissue produces a high {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity of INKA in atrial myocytes. {beta}-adrenergic regulation of INKA is locally mediated in the NKA1-Cav1.2 nanodomain via A-kinase anchoring proteins. Conclusions: NKA1, Cav1.2 and their accessory proteins form a structural and regulatory nanodomain at the cardiac dyad. The tissue-specific composition and local adrenergic regulation of this &#34;signaling cloud&#34; is a main regulator of the distinct global intracellular Na&#43; and Ca2&#43; concentrations in atrial and ventricular myocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimThe biological mechanisms linking sedentary lifestyles and metabolic derangements are incompletely understood. Our animal model mimics sedentary behavior during early life, enabling us to explore the associated chromatin epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes.

MethodsDrosophila larvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the shibire1 (shi) gene were used. shi homozygous mutant larvae undergo instant arrest of muscle contraction at a restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C), without affecting other systems. Both shi and control (y,w) larvae were held at permissive temperature (18{degrees}C), and transferred to restrictive temperature (30{degrees}C) for six hours. Larvae were then dissected, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies specific for epigenetic marks of chromatin activation (H3K9ac) and repression (H3K27me3), and their fluorescence signal was quantified. In addition, whole genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA in muscle-specific inactive, or control larvae was performed using muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol.

ResultsInducing muscle inactivity in shi larvae at 300C yielded a significantly higher ratio between chromatin activation and repression, based upon H3K9ac/H3K27me3 signals (p=0.025), relative to all control groups for which this ratio was comparable (p=0.995). Furthermore, muscle inactivation led to altered Pol II binding to 121 out of 2010 genes (6%). The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. In addition, a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs was noted in the muscle-inactive larvae.

ConclusionInducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin, triggering an altered epigenetic balance, as well as downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes essential for muscle function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity and others. Extrapolating these findings to humans holds promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mavacamten is a novel, FDA-approved, small molecule therapeutic designed to regulate cardiac function by selectively but reversibly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin. It shifts myosin towards ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone. It remains unresolved whether mavacamten permanently sequesters these myosin heads in the off state(s) or whether these heads can be recruited in response to physiological stimuli when required to boost cardiac output. We show that cardiac myosins stabilized in these off state(s) by mavacamten are recruitable by Ca2&#43;, increased heart rate, stretch, and {beta}-adrenergic ({beta}-AR) stimulation, all known physiological inotropic effectors. At the molecular level, we show that, in presence of mavacamten, Ca2&#43; increases myosin ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from the reserve super-relaxed (SRX) state to the active disordered relaxed (DRX) state. At the myofilament level, both Ca2&#43; and passive lengthening can shift ordered off myosin heads from positions close to the thick filament backbone to disordered on states closer to the thin filaments in the presence of mavacamten. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, increased stimulation rates enhanced shortening fraction in mavacamten-treated cells. This observation was confirmed in vivo in telemetered rats, where left-ventricular dP/dtmax, an index of inotropy, increased with heart rate in mavacamten treated animals. Finally, we show that {beta}-AR stimulation in vivo increases left-ventricular function and stroke volume in the setting of mavacamten. Our data demonstrate that the mavacamten-promoted off states of myosin in the thick filament are activable, at least partially, thus leading to preservation of cardiac reserve mechanisms.

Significance statementMavacamten is the first myosin-targeted small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA to treat obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by attenuating myocardial hyperdynamic contraction. The recruitment of cardiac contractility is, however, vital to ensure sufficient cardiac output during increased physiological demand. Here we show that major inotropic effectors are at least partially preserved in the setting of mavacamten, resulting in maintenance of cardiac reserve mechanisms. These results not only suggest an alternative mechanistic explanation, beyond mere LV outflow tract obstruction removal, for the clinically observed increase in peak oxygen uptake with exercise in HCM patients receiving mavacamten, but also lay the groundwork for a potential methodology to investigate the sarcomeric basis of chronotropic incompetence in disease states to motivate new therapeutic interventions.</p>
