Mitochondria in HF show changes in structure, while myofibrils exhibit increased cross-sectional area and branching. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses indicate concomitant dysregulation in key pathways. The findings underscore the need for personalized treatments considering individualized structural changes in HF.\nDeterminants of cerebral blood flow and arterial transit time in healthy older adults\nAuthors: Feron, J.; Segaert, K.; Rahman, F.; Fosstveit, S.; Joyce, K. E.; Gilani, A.; Lohne-Seiler, H.; Bernsten, S.; Mullinger, K. J.; Lucas, S. J. E.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571578\nCerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT), markers of brain vascular health, worsen with age. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify modifiable determinants of CBF and ATT in healthy older adults (n=78, aged 60 -81 yrs). Associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and CBF or ATT were of particular interest as the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness is not clear in existing literature. Secondly, this study assessed whether CBF or ATT relate to cognitive function in older adults. Results from multiple linear regressions found higher BMI was associated with lower global CBF ({beta}=-0.35, P=0.008) and a longer global ATT ({beta}=0.30, P=0.017), global ATT lengthened with increasing age ({beta}=0.43, P=0.004), and higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with longer ATT in parietal ({beta}=0.44, P=0.004) and occipital ({beta}=0.45, P=0.003) regions. Global or regional CBF or ATT were not associated with processing speed, working memory, or attention. In conclusion, preventing excessive weight gain may help attenuate age-related declines in brain vascular health. ATT may be more sensitive to age-related decline than CBF, and therefore useful for early detection and management of cerebrovascular impairment. Finally, cardiorespiratory fitness appears to have little effect on CBF but may induce longer ATT in specific regions.\nBone quality following peripubertal growth in a mouse model of transmasculine gender-affirming hormone therapy\nAuthors: Henry, B.; Dela Cruz, C.; Goulet, R. W.; Nolan, B. T.; Locke, C.; Padmanabhan, V.; Moravec, M.; Shikanov, A.; Killian, M. L.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570840\nDuring peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa + T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender youth.\nVCD-induced menopause mouse model reveals reprogramming of hepatic metabolism\nAuthors: Kumari, R.; Ponte, M.; Franczak, E.; Prom, J.; O'Neil, M.; Sardiu, M. E.; Lutkewitte, A.; Shankar, K.; Morris, E. M.; Thyfault, J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571644\nMenopause adversely impacts systemic energy metabolism and increases the risk of metabolic disease(s) including hepatic steatosis, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Dosing female mice with vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (VCD) selectively causes follicular atresia in ovaries, leading to a murine menopause-like phenotype. In this study, we treated female C57BL6/J mice with VCD (160mg/kg i.p. for 20 consecutive days followed by verification of the lack of estrous cycling) to investigate changes in body composition, energy expenditure (EE), hepatic mitochondrial function, and hepatic steatosis across different dietary conditions. VCD treatment induced ovarian follicular loss and increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in female mice, mimicking a menopause-like phenotype. VCD treatment did not affect body composition, or EE in mice on a low-fat diet or in response to a short-term (1-week) high-fat, high sucrose diet (HFHS). However, the transition to a HFHS lowered cage activity in VCD mice. A chronic HFHS diet (16 weeks) significantly increased weight gain, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis in VCD-treated mice compared to HFHS-fed controls. In the liver, VCD mice showed suppressed hepatic mitochondrial respiration on LFD, while chronic HFHS diet resulted in compensatory increases in hepatic mitochondrial respiration. Also, liver RNA sequencing revealed that VCD promoted global upregulation of hepatic lipid/cholesterol synthesis pathways. Our findings suggest that the VCD- induced menopause model compromises hepatic mitochondrial function and lipid/cholesterol homeostasis that sets the stage for HFHS diet-induced steatosis while also increasing susceptibility to obesity.\nMotor mirror neurons may not be a predictor of learning but reflect the effect of motor learning\nAuthors: Blagoveshchenski, E.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.572003\nThe mirror neurons system (MNS) fires during both the performance of an action and observation of the same action being performed by another. On the level of motor output, activation of the MNS is thought to be represented in the phenomenon of motor resonance, which manifests in a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focused on how and to what extent sensorimotor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of sensorimotor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was held to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation in different conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions in total), the sensorimotor learning part was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task. We observed a statistically significant decrease of reaction time in the process of learning in the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting the process of putative mirror neurons activity. However, our data demonstrate that the sensorimotor learning rate was not associated with either pretraining or post-training estimates of motor facilitation during action observation and that sensorimotor learning does not affect the pattern of motor resonance.\nInhibition of MMP 2 protects the endothelial glycocalyx and improves diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: Buffonge, S.; Qiu, Y.; Fawaz, S.; Gamez, M.; Crompton, M.; Butler, M. J.; Welsh, G. I.; Madeddu, P.; Foster, R. R.; Satchell, S. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572183\nThe coronary microvascular endothelial glycocalyx (EGlx) is a vital regulator of vascular permeability and EGlx damage contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) have been identified as key enzymes in the degradation of EGlx components, notably syndecan 4 (SDC4), and are upregulated in diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of MMP2/9 can protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Type 1 diabetes was induced in FVB mice by streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Mice were treated with daily injections of the MMP2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, for 2 weeks from 7 weeks post STZ. Echocardiography was utilised to assess heart function and lectin staining for the measurement of EGlx depth. Immunolabelling of heart sections for albumin provided an indication of albumin extravasation. A mechanism of EGlx shedding was investigated in vitro in human coronary microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF- and SB-3CT. Diabetic mice developed diastolic dysfunction from 6 weeks post STZ. MMP2/9 inhibition reversed diastolic dysfunction, EGlx thinning and albumin extravasation in diabetic animals. In vitro, TNF- caused an increase in MMP9 activity and SDC4 shedding from human coronary microvascular endothelial cells. Treatment with SB-3CT reduced MMP9 activity and prevented SDC4 shedding. Knockdown of MMP9 expression prevented TNF- induced SDC4 shedding. This study demonstrates MMP2/9 inhibition as a strategy to protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our findings suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.\nEffects of aging on glucose and lipid metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lien, E. C.; Vu, N.; Westermark, A. M.; Danai, L. V.; Lau, A. N.; Gultekin, Y.; Kukurugya, M. A.; Bennett, B. D.; Vander Heiden, M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572088\nAging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD+, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD+ regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD+-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD+/NADH during healthy aging.\nA pilot study of the comparison using a standard and individual altitude exposure protocol in elite gymnasts\nAuthors: Grushin, A.; Zelenkova, I.; Ilin, D.; Zotkin, S.; Korneev, P.; Koprov, S.; Almyashev, D.; Badtieva, V.; Glazachev, O.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.569719\nAimEvaluate the effectiveness of the use of altitude training in elite gymnasts and compare two approaches of the altitude exposure protocols. Materials and methodsThe study involved 6 athletes of high qualification specializing in gymnastics (22 (20.5-22.5 years, 166.5 (162.5-169) cm, 63.5 (60-65 kg)). Athletes underwent hypoxic exposure using \"Live high - train low\" method using standard (18 days) and individual protocol (18 days). The biochemical parameters of blood, total hemoglobin mass, blood volume, hypoxic index, and oxygen saturation of arterial blood were determined. ResultsThe tHb-mass values before the standard protocol were 678.5 (664-712.5) g, immediately after 696 (679-752.7) g. Before the start of the individual protocol, the tHb-mass values were 687 (622.7-752) g, immediately after 751.5 (750.2-827) g, (p \u003c 0.05). The tHb-mass shifts after exposure to the unified protocol were 24 (4.8-31) g, and after personified 73.5 (55.5-132.7) g, (p \u003c 0.05). At the same time, ALT, AST, and CPK values did not differ from the baseline, and testosterone values increased after a personalized hypoxic exposure program. ConclusionsThe application of personalized protocol of additional hypoxic impact seems to be more effective than standard protocol in terms of change of hematological parameters.\nA sexually dimorphic hepatic cycle of very low density lipoprotein uptake and assembly\nAuthors: Martini, T.; Gobet, C.; Salati, A.; Blanc, J.; Mookhoek, A.; Knott, G.; Sordet-Dessimoz, J.; Naef, F.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561324\nThe liver shows striking sexual dimorphism, which is reflected in differences between women and men in pathologies associated with hepatic function. Recent single-cell transcriptomes revealed spatiotemporal programmes of liver function on the sublobular scale. However, how sexual dimorphism affects this space-time logic remains poorly understood. To address this, we performed single-cell RNA-seq in the mouse liver, which allowed us to model how lobular position, circadian time and sex shape the transcriptome. We found that sex, space and time markedly influence xenobiotic detoxification and lipoprotein metabolism. Crucially, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is restricted to the pericentral zone, with significantly higher mRNA and protein levels in female mice. In humans, VLDLR expression is pericentral, with higher mRNA and protein levels in premenopausal women compared to similarly aged men. Hepatic VLDLR expression changes with age and body mass index, and is lower in individuals with atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction. In mice, several genes involved in VLDL assembly are periportally biased. Electron microscopy confirmed a periportal bias in VLDL production, revealing a previously unknown sexually dimorphic hepatic cycle of periportal formation and pericentral uptake of VLDL. Together, our work provides new insights into the sexual dimorphism characterizing differences in VLDL kinetics and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\nAge-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are moreaffected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging\nAuthors: Kurochkina, N. S.; Orlova, M. A.; Vigovskiy, M. A.; Vepkhvadze, T. F.; Zgoda, V. G.; Vavilov, N. E.; Makhnovskii, P. A.; Grigorieva, O. A.; Boroday, Y. R.; Philippov, V. V.; Lednev, E. M.; Efimenko, A. Y.; Popov, D. V.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569524\nEvaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT), markers of brain vascular health, worsen with age. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify modifiable determinants of CBF and ATT in healthy older adults (n=78, aged 60 -81 yrs). Associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and CBF or ATT were of particular interest as the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness is not clear in existing literature. Secondly, this study assessed whether CBF or ATT relate to cognitive function in older adults. Results from multiple linear regressions found higher BMI was associated with lower global CBF ({beta}=-0.35, P=0.008) and a longer global ATT ({beta}=0.30, P=0.017), global ATT lengthened with increasing age ({beta}=0.43, P=0.004), and higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with longer ATT in parietal ({beta}=0.44, P=0.004) and occipital ({beta}=0.45, P=0.003) regions. Global or regional CBF or ATT were not associated with processing speed, working memory, or attention. In conclusion, preventing excessive weight gain may help attenuate age-related declines in brain vascular health. ATT may be more sensitive to age-related decline than CBF, and therefore useful for early detection and management of cerebrovascular impairment. Finally, cardiorespiratory fitness appears to have little effect on CBF but may induce longer ATT in specific regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa &#43; T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender youth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Menopause adversely impacts systemic energy metabolism and increases the risk of metabolic disease(s) including hepatic steatosis, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Dosing female mice with vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (VCD) selectively causes follicular atresia in ovaries, leading to a murine menopause-like phenotype. In this study, we treated female C57BL6/J mice with VCD (160mg/kg i.p. for 20 consecutive days followed by verification of the lack of estrous cycling) to investigate changes in body composition, energy expenditure (EE), hepatic mitochondrial function, and hepatic steatosis across different dietary conditions. VCD treatment induced ovarian follicular loss and increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in female mice, mimicking a menopause-like phenotype. VCD treatment did not affect body composition, or EE in mice on a low-fat diet or in response to a short-term (1-week) high-fat, high sucrose diet (HFHS). However, the transition to a HFHS lowered cage activity in VCD mice. A chronic HFHS diet (16 weeks) significantly increased weight gain, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis in VCD-treated mice compared to HFHS-fed controls. In the liver, VCD mice showed suppressed hepatic mitochondrial respiration on LFD, while chronic HFHS diet resulted in compensatory increases in hepatic mitochondrial respiration. Also, liver RNA sequencing revealed that VCD promoted global upregulation of hepatic lipid/cholesterol synthesis pathways. Our findings suggest that the VCD- induced menopause model compromises hepatic mitochondrial function and lipid/cholesterol homeostasis that sets the stage for HFHS diet-induced steatosis while also increasing susceptibility to obesity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mirror neurons system (MNS) fires during both the performance of an action and observation of the same action being performed by another. On the level of motor output, activation of the MNS is thought to be represented in the phenomenon of motor resonance, which manifests in a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focused on how and to what extent sensorimotor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of sensorimotor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was held to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation in different conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions in total), the sensorimotor learning part was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task. We observed a statistically significant decrease of reaction time in the process of learning in the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting the process of putative mirror neurons activity. However, our data demonstrate that the sensorimotor learning rate was not associated with either pretraining or post-training estimates of motor facilitation during action observation and that sensorimotor learning does not affect the pattern of motor resonance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The coronary microvascular endothelial glycocalyx (EGlx) is a vital regulator of vascular permeability and EGlx damage contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) have been identified as key enzymes in the degradation of EGlx components, notably syndecan 4 (SDC4), and are upregulated in diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of MMP2/9 can protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Type 1 diabetes was induced in FVB mice by streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Mice were treated with daily injections of the MMP2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, for 2 weeks from 7 weeks post STZ. Echocardiography was utilised to assess heart function and lectin staining for the measurement of EGlx depth. Immunolabelling of heart sections for albumin provided an indication of albumin extravasation. A mechanism of EGlx shedding was investigated in vitro in human coronary microvascular endothelial cells treated with TNF- and SB-3CT. Diabetic mice developed diastolic dysfunction from 6 weeks post STZ. MMP2/9 inhibition reversed diastolic dysfunction, EGlx thinning and albumin extravasation in diabetic animals. In vitro, TNF- caused an increase in MMP9 activity and SDC4 shedding from human coronary microvascular endothelial cells. Treatment with SB-3CT reduced MMP9 activity and prevented SDC4 shedding. Knockdown of MMP9 expression prevented TNF- induced SDC4 shedding. This study demonstrates MMP2/9 inhibition as a strategy to protect the EGlx and improve diastolic function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our findings suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD&#43;, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD&#43;, NADH, and the NAD&#43;/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD&#43; from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD&#43; regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD&#43;-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD&#43;/NADH during healthy aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimEvaluate the effectiveness of the use of altitude training in elite gymnasts and compare two approaches of the altitude exposure protocols.

Materials and methodsThe study involved 6 athletes of high qualification specializing in gymnastics (22 (20.5-22.5 years, 166.5 (162.5-169) cm, 63.5 (60-65 kg)). Athletes underwent hypoxic exposure using &#34;Live high - train low&#34; method using standard (18 days) and individual protocol (18 days). The biochemical parameters of blood, total hemoglobin mass, blood volume, hypoxic index, and oxygen saturation of arterial blood were determined.

ResultsThe tHb-mass values before the standard protocol were 678.5 (664-712.5) g, immediately after 696 (679-752.7) g. Before the start of the individual protocol, the tHb-mass values were 687 (622.7-752) g, immediately after 751.5 (750.2-827) g, (p &lt; 0.05). The tHb-mass shifts after exposure to the unified protocol were 24 (4.8-31) g, and after personified 73.5 (55.5-132.7) g, (p &lt; 0.05). At the same time, ALT, AST, and CPK values did not differ from the baseline, and testosterone values increased after a personalized hypoxic exposure program.

ConclusionsThe application of personalized protocol of additional hypoxic impact seems to be more effective than standard protocol in terms of change of hematological parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The liver shows striking sexual dimorphism, which is reflected in differences between women and men in pathologies associated with hepatic function. Recent single-cell transcriptomes revealed spatiotemporal programmes of liver function on the sublobular scale. However, how sexual dimorphism affects this space-time logic remains poorly understood. To address this, we performed single-cell RNA-seq in the mouse liver, which allowed us to model how lobular position, circadian time and sex shape the transcriptome. We found that sex, space and time markedly influence xenobiotic detoxification and lipoprotein metabolism. Crucially, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is restricted to the pericentral zone, with significantly higher mRNA and protein levels in female mice. In humans, VLDLR expression is pericentral, with higher mRNA and protein levels in premenopausal women compared to similarly aged men. Hepatic VLDLR expression changes with age and body mass index, and is lower in individuals with atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction. In mice, several genes involved in VLDL assembly are periportally biased. Electron microscopy confirmed a periportal bias in VLDL production, revealing a previously unknown sexually dimorphic hepatic cycle of periportal formation and pericentral uptake of VLDL. Together, our work provides new insights into the sexual dimorphism characterizing differences in VLDL kinetics and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression ([~]4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes ([~]200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.</p>
