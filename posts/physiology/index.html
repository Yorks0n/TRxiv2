D.; Lin, A.; Bhaumik, D.; Shah, S.; Blade, T.; Gray, W.; Chamoli, M.; Eap, B.; Panda, O.; Diaz, D.; Garcia, T. Y.; Stubbs, B. J.; Lithgow, G. J.; Schilling, B.; Verdin, E.; Chaudhuri, A.; Newman, J. C.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547547\nLoss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.\nThe Effect of Gradual Ovarian Failure on Dynamic Muscle Function and the Role of High Intensity Interval Training on Mitigating Impairments\nAuthors: Hubbard, E. F.; Mashouri, P.; Pyle, W. G.; Power, G. A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548999\nSkeletal muscle function is impaired in menopause and exercise may mitigate this decline. We used the VCD model of menopause to investigate the effects of gradual ovarian failure on skeletal muscle contractile function and whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) can mitigate impairments. Sexually mature female CD-1 mice were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=5), VCD-sedentary (n=5), or VCD-training (n=5). Following ovarian failure, the VCD-training group underwent 8 weeks of uphill HIIT. Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after ovarian failure, representing late menopause. Single muscle fibres from the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected, chemically permeabilized, and mechanically tested. Single muscle fibres were maximally activated (pCa 4.5) then isotonic load clamps were performed to calculate force-velocity-power curves. Absolute force and peak power were 31% and 32% lower in VCD-sedentary fibres compared to control fibres, respectively, in both SOL and EDL muscles. Despite reductions in absolute force and therefore lighter relative loads imposed during the isotonic contractions in VCD-sedentary fibres, there were no concomitant increases in contractile velocity. HIIT was partially effective at mitigating power loss (22% higher peak power in VCD-training compared to VCD-sedentary), but only in fast-type SOL fibres. These findings indicate that ovarian failure impairs dynamic contractile function likely through a combination of lower force-generating capacity and slower shortening velocity, and that HIIT may be insufficient to completely counteract the deleterious effects of menopause at the cellular level.\nSeptin 7 Interacts With Numb To Preserve Sarcomere Structural Organization And Muscle Contractile Function.\nAuthors: De Gasperi, R.; Csernoch, L.; Dienes, B.; Gonczi, M.; Chakrabarty, J. K.; Goeta, S.; Aslan, A.; Toro, C. A.; Karasik, D.; Brown, L. M.; Brotto, M.; Cardozo, C. P.\nScore: 12.7, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.11.540467\nHere, we investigated mechanisms by which aging-related diminished levels of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification and termination of intracellular signaling. Numb expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads. Conditional inactivation of Numb in myofibers causes weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb indicated that Septin 7 is a potential Numb binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of Numb led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings support the conclusion that Septin 7 is a Numb binding partner. Because prior reports showed that conditional inactivation of Septin 7 in skeletal muscle led to weakness and disorganization of sarcomeres, and altered mitochondrial size, we also conclude that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for proper structural organization of the sarcomere, for optimal muscle contractile function, and for control of the size and function of mitochondria.\nHip thrust and back squat training elicit similar gluteus muscle hypertrophy and transfer similarly to the deadlift\nAuthors: Plotkin, D. L.; Rodas, M. A.; Vigotsky, A.; McIntosh, M. C.; Breeze, E.; Ubrik, R.; Robitzsch, C.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Mattingly, M. L.; Michel, J. M.; Kontos, N. J.; Fruge, A. D.; Wilburn, C. M.; Weimar, W. H.; Bashir, A.; Beyers, R. J.; Henselmans, M.; Contreras, B. M.; Roberts, M. D.\nScore: 78.3, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nWhen the tap runs dry: The physiological effects of acute experimental dehydration in Peromyscus eremicus\nAuthors: Blumstein, D. M.; MacManes, M. D.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547568\nDesert organisms have evolved physiological, biochemical, and genomic mechanisms to survive the extreme aridity of desert environments. Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements to characterize the response to water-deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 hours of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant weight loss likely related to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared to hydrated males while body temperature decreased for females without access to water compared to hydrated, suggesting daily torpor in females.\nExercise on cytokine responses in males and females: Effect of leucine, HMB and BCAA.\nAuthors: Brown, A. D.; Grammenou, M.; Tee, C. C. L.; Chong, M. C.; Stewart, C. E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548561\nPurposeTo identify the effects of leucine, {beta}-hydroxy {beta}-methylbutyrate (HMB) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) on post-exercise cytokine responses in females and males. MethodsMales (n=53) and females (n=37) completed 100 drop jumps and consumed either no supplement, leucine (3g/d), HMB (3g/d) or BCAA (4.5g/d) from 1d pre to 14d post-exercise. Muscle soreness, squat jumps, chair rises and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at pre, post, 24h, 48h, 7 and 14d. Blood lactate (pre, post), 10 cytokines (pre, 24h, 48h, 7d) and oestradiol (pre, 7d) were also measured. ResultsWithout supplementation post-exercise, soreness was induced in both males (6-fold) and females (5-fold). With supplementation, there were no increases in CK or oestradiol in females and no impact on muscle soreness, performance, or function in both sexes. In males, CK was elevated in untreated (48%) and leucine (69%) conditions vs baseline, but these were suppressed with HMB and BCAA. IL-7 was elevated in females vs males at baseline (6.3-fold), leucine increased IL-7 concentrations in females at 24h (17.0-fold), 48h (5.1-fold) vs males. With HMB, TNFr1- increased in females at 24h (2.2-fold), 48h (2.3-fold) and 7d (2.3-fold) vs males. In males with BCAA, TNFr1- decreased (P=0.06) from pre to 24h (6.8-fold), then increased (P\u003c0.05) from 24 to 48h (8.0-fold). ConclusionAlthough supplements were without effect on soreness following exercise, the cytokine response was evoked by exercise and impacted significantly by leucine, HMB and BCAA in females vs males. This improved cytokine response in females could lead to improved resistance to damage.\nAAV-mediated Delivery of Plakophilin-2a Arrests Progression of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy in Murine Hearts: Preclinical Evidence Supporting Gene Therapy in Humans\nAuthors: van Opbergen, C. J.; Narayanan, B.; Sacramento, C. B.; Stiles, K. M.; Mishra, V.; Frenk, E.; Ricks, D.; Chen, G.; Zhang, M.; Yarabe, P.; Schwartz, J.; Delmar, M.; Herzog, C. D.; Cerrone, M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548590\nBackgroundPathogenic variants in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias and progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. No effective medical therapy is available to prevent and/or arrest the disease. We tested the hypothesis that AAV-mediated delivery of the human PKP2 gene to an adult mammalian heart deficient in PKP2 can arrest disease progression and significantly prolong survival. MethodsExperiments were carried out using a cardiac-specific, tamoxifen (TAM)-activated PKP2 knockout murine model (PKP2-cKO). The potential therapeutic, AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601), is a recombinant AAVrh.74 gene therapy viral vector encoding the human PKP2 variant A (PKP2a). AAVrh.74-PKP2a was delivered to adult mice by a single tail vein injection either before or after TAM-activated PKP2-cKO. PKP2 expression was confirmed by molecular and histopathologic analyses. Cardiac function and disease progression were monitored by survival analyses, echocardiography and electrocardiography. ResultsConsistent with prior findings, loss of PKP2 expression caused 100% mortality within 50 days after TAM injection. In contrast, AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated PKP2a expression resulted in 100% survival for more than 5 months (at study termination). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that AAVrh.74-PKP2a prevented right ventricle dilation, arrested left ventricle functional decline, and mitigated arrhythmia burden. Molecular and histological analysis showed AAVrh.74-PKP2a- mediated transgene mRNA and protein expression and appropriate PKP2 localization at the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Importantly, therapeutic benefit was shown in mice receiving AAVrh.74-PKP2a after disease onset. ConclusionThese preclinical data demonstrate the potential for AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601) as a therapeutic for PKP2-related ARVC in both early and more advanced stages of disease.\nA co-ordinated transcriptional programme in the maternal liver supplies LC-PUFAs to the conceptus using phospholipids\nAuthors: Amarsi, R.; Furse, S.; Cleaton, M. A.; Maurel, S.; Mitchell, A. L.; Ferguson-Smith, A. C.; Cenac, N.; Williamson, C.; Koulman, A.; Charalambous, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546226\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) and their derivatives, the long and very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), are preferentially transported by the mother to the fetus. Failure to supply EFAs is strongly linked with stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, dietary supplementation during pregnancy is unable to simply reverse these outcomes, suggesting imperfectly understood interactions between dietary EFA intake and the molecular mechanisms of maternal supply. Here we combine untargeted lipidomics with transcriptional profiling of healthy and genetically-manipulated murine models to understand the maternal adaptations required to provide LC-PUFAs to the developing fetus. We discovered a late pregnancy-specific, selective activation of the Liver X Receptor signalling pathway which dramatically increases maternal supply of LC-PUFAs within circulating phospholipids. Crucially, genetic ablation of this pathway in the mother reduced LC-PUFA accumulation by the fetus. Overall our work suggests new molecular strategies for improving maternal-fetal transfer of these important lipids.\nAster-dependent non-vesicular transport facilitates dietary cholesterol uptake\nAuthors: Ferrari, A.; Whang, E.; Xiao, X.; Kennelly, J. P.; Romartinez- Alonso, B.; Mack, J. J.; Weston, T.; Chen, K.; Kim, Y.; Tol, M.; Bideyan, L.; Nguyen, A.; Gao, Y.; Cui, L.; Bedard, A. H.; Sandhu, J.; Lee, S. D.; Fairall, L.; Williams, K. J.; Song, W.; Munguia, P.; Russell, R. A.; Martin, M. G.; Jung, M. E.; Jiang, H.; Schwabe, J. W.; Young, S. G.; Tontonoz, P.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548168\nIntestinal cholesterol absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption. One-Sentence SummaryIdentification of a targetable pathway for regulation of dietary cholesterol absorption\nImpact of High Fat Diet and Sex in a Rabbit Model of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\nAuthors: Kuroiwa, T.; Lui, H.; Nakagawa, K.; Iida, N.; Desrochers, C.; Wan, R.; Adam, E.; Larson, D.; Amadio, P. C.; Gingery, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549152\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common musculoskeletal disorder, characterized by fibrosis of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}). Risk factors for CTS include metabolic dysfunction and age. Additionally, the incidence of CTS is higher in women. In this study we hypothesized that a high-fat diet (HFD), a common driver of metabolic dysfunction, would promote SSCT fibrosis found in CTS and that this response would be sex dependent. To test this, we examined the effects of HFD and sex on SSCT fibrosis using our established rabbit model of CTS. Forty-eight (24 male, 24 female) adult rabbits were divided into four groups including HFD or standard diet with and without CTS induction. SSCT was collected for histological and gene expression analysis. HFD promoted SSCT thickening and upregulated profibrotic genes, including TGF-{beta}. Fibrotic genes were differentially expressed in males and females. Interestingly while the prevalence of CTS is greater in women than in men, the converse is observed in the presence of metabolic dysfunction. This work recapitulates this clinical observation and begins to elucidate the sex-based differences found in SSCT fibrosis. This knowledge should drive further research and may lead to metabolic and sex specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CTS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we identify {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), a ketone body, as a regulator of protein solubility in the aging brain. {beta}HB is a small molecule metabolite which primarily provides an oxidative substrate for ATP during hypoglycemic conditions, and also regulates other cellular processes through covalent and noncovalent protein interactions. We demonstrate {beta}HB-induced protein insolubility across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo mouse systems. This activity is shared by select structurally similar metabolites, is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. Furthermore, this phenotype is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-{beta}, and exogenous {beta}HB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-{beta} aggregation toxicity. We have generated a comprehensive atlas of the {beta}HB-induced protein insolublome ex vivo and in vivo using mass spectrometry proteomics, and have identified common protein domains within {beta}HB target sequences. Finally, we show enrichment of neurodegeneration-related proteins among {beta}HB targets and the clearance of these targets from mouse brain, likely via {beta}HB-induced autophagy. Overall, these data indicate a new metabolically regulated mechanism of proteostasis relevant to aging and AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle function is impaired in menopause and exercise may mitigate this decline. We used the VCD model of menopause to investigate the effects of gradual ovarian failure on skeletal muscle contractile function and whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) can mitigate impairments. Sexually mature female CD-1 mice were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=5), VCD-sedentary (n=5), or VCD-training (n=5). Following ovarian failure, the VCD-training group underwent 8 weeks of uphill HIIT. Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after ovarian failure, representing late menopause. Single muscle fibres from the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected, chemically permeabilized, and mechanically tested. Single muscle fibres were maximally activated (pCa 4.5) then isotonic load clamps were performed to calculate force-velocity-power curves. Absolute force and peak power were 31% and 32% lower in VCD-sedentary fibres compared to control fibres, respectively, in both SOL and EDL muscles. Despite reductions in absolute force and therefore lighter relative loads imposed during the isotonic contractions in VCD-sedentary fibres, there were no concomitant increases in contractile velocity. HIIT was partially effective at mitigating power loss (22% higher peak power in VCD-training compared to VCD-sedentary), but only in fast-type SOL fibres. These findings indicate that ovarian failure impairs dynamic contractile function likely through a combination of lower force-generating capacity and slower shortening velocity, and that HIIT may be insufficient to completely counteract the deleterious effects of menopause at the cellular level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Here, we investigated mechanisms by which aging-related diminished levels of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification and termination of intracellular signaling. Numb expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads. Conditional inactivation of Numb in myofibers causes weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb indicated that Septin 7 is a potential Numb binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of Numb led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings support the conclusion that Septin 7 is a Numb binding partner. Because prior reports showed that conditional inactivation of Septin 7 in skeletal muscle led to weakness and disorganization of sarcomeres, and altered mitochondrial size, we also conclude that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for proper structural organization of the sarcomere, for optimal muscle contractile function, and for control of the size and function of mitochondria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Desert organisms have evolved physiological, biochemical, and genomic mechanisms to survive the extreme aridity of desert environments. Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements to characterize the response to water-deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 hours of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant weight loss likely related to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared to hydrated males while body temperature decreased for females without access to water compared to hydrated, suggesting daily torpor in females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeTo identify the effects of leucine, {beta}-hydroxy {beta}-methylbutyrate (HMB) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) on post-exercise cytokine responses in females and males.

MethodsMales (n=53) and females (n=37) completed 100 drop jumps and consumed either no supplement, leucine (3g/d), HMB (3g/d) or BCAA (4.5g/d) from 1d pre to 14d post-exercise. Muscle soreness, squat jumps, chair rises and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at pre, post, 24h, 48h, 7 and 14d. Blood lactate (pre, post), 10 cytokines (pre, 24h, 48h, 7d) and oestradiol (pre, 7d) were also measured.

ResultsWithout supplementation post-exercise, soreness was induced in both males (6-fold) and females (5-fold). With supplementation, there were no increases in CK or oestradiol in females and no impact on muscle soreness, performance, or function in both sexes. In males, CK was elevated in untreated (48%) and leucine (69%) conditions vs baseline, but these were suppressed with HMB and BCAA. IL-7 was elevated in females vs males at baseline (6.3-fold), leucine increased IL-7 concentrations in females at 24h (17.0-fold), 48h (5.1-fold) vs males. With HMB, TNFr1- increased in females at 24h (2.2-fold), 48h (2.3-fold) and 7d (2.3-fold) vs males. In males with BCAA, TNFr1- decreased (P=0.06) from pre to 24h (6.8-fold), then increased (P&lt;0.05) from 24 to 48h (8.0-fold).

ConclusionAlthough supplements were without effect on soreness following exercise, the cytokine response was evoked by exercise and impacted significantly by leucine, HMB and BCAA in females vs males. This improved cytokine response in females could lead to improved resistance to damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPathogenic variants in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias and progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. No effective medical therapy is available to prevent and/or arrest the disease. We tested the hypothesis that AAV-mediated delivery of the human PKP2 gene to an adult mammalian heart deficient in PKP2 can arrest disease progression and significantly prolong survival.

MethodsExperiments were carried out using a cardiac-specific, tamoxifen (TAM)-activated PKP2 knockout murine model (PKP2-cKO). The potential therapeutic, AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601), is a recombinant AAVrh.74 gene therapy viral vector encoding the human PKP2 variant A (PKP2a). AAVrh.74-PKP2a was delivered to adult mice by a single tail vein injection either before or after TAM-activated PKP2-cKO. PKP2 expression was confirmed by molecular and histopathologic analyses. Cardiac function and disease progression were monitored by survival analyses, echocardiography and electrocardiography.

ResultsConsistent with prior findings, loss of PKP2 expression caused 100% mortality within 50 days after TAM injection. In contrast, AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated PKP2a expression resulted in 100% survival for more than 5 months (at study termination). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that AAVrh.74-PKP2a prevented right ventricle dilation, arrested left ventricle functional decline, and mitigated arrhythmia burden. Molecular and histological analysis showed AAVrh.74-PKP2a- mediated transgene mRNA and protein expression and appropriate PKP2 localization at the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Importantly, therapeutic benefit was shown in mice receiving AAVrh.74-PKP2a after disease onset.

ConclusionThese preclinical data demonstrate the potential for AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601) as a therapeutic for PKP2-related ARVC in both early and more advanced stages of disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their derivatives, the long and very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), are preferentially transported by the mother to the fetus. Failure to supply EFAs is strongly linked with stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, dietary supplementation during pregnancy is unable to simply reverse these outcomes, suggesting imperfectly understood interactions between dietary EFA intake and the molecular mechanisms of maternal supply. Here we combine untargeted lipidomics with transcriptional profiling of healthy and genetically-manipulated murine models to understand the maternal adaptations required to provide LC-PUFAs to the developing fetus. We discovered a late pregnancy-specific, selective activation of the Liver X Receptor signalling pathway which dramatically increases maternal supply of LC-PUFAs within circulating phospholipids. Crucially, genetic ablation of this pathway in the mother reduced LC-PUFA accumulation by the fetus. Overall our work suggests new molecular strategies for improving maternal-fetal transfer of these important lipids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.

        <p class="abstract">Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common musculoskeletal disorder, characterized by fibrosis of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}). Risk factors for CTS include metabolic dysfunction and age. Additionally, the incidence of CTS is higher in women. In this study we hypothesized that a high-fat diet (HFD), a common driver of metabolic dysfunction, would promote SSCT fibrosis found in CTS and that this response would be sex dependent. To test this, we examined the effects of HFD and sex on SSCT fibrosis using our established rabbit model of CTS. Forty-eight (24 male, 24 female) adult rabbits were divided into four groups including HFD or standard diet with and without CTS induction. SSCT was collected for histological and gene expression analysis. HFD promoted SSCT thickening and upregulated profibrotic genes, including TGF-{beta}. Fibrotic genes were differentially expressed in males and females. Interestingly while the prevalence of CTS is greater in women than in men, the converse is observed in the presence of metabolic dysfunction. This work recapitulates this clinical observation and begins to elucidate the sex-based differences found in SSCT fibrosis. This knowledge should drive further research and may lead to metabolic and sex specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CTS.</p>
