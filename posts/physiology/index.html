V.; Zandawala, M.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579245\nInsects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain their nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. While the identities and functions of various insect metabolic and diuretic hormones have been well-established, the characterization of an anti-diuretic signaling system that is conserved across most insects is still lacking. To address this, here we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in Drosophila. The Drosophila ITP gene encodes five transcript variants which generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. Using a combination of anatomical mapping and single-cell transcriptome analyses, we comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa is released during dehydration and recombinant Drosophila ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach and the ex vivo secretion assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as an elusive Drosophila ITPa receptor. Thus, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules abolishes the inhibitory effect of ITPa on diuretic hormone secretion. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with ITPa overexpression in ITP neurons. Interestingly, ITPa-Gyc76C pathways deciphered here are reminiscent of the atrial natriuretic peptide signaling in mammals. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify synaptic and paracrine pathways upstream and downstream of ITP-expressing neurons. Taken together, our systematic characterization of the ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila.\nScrutinizing science to save lives: uncovering flaws in the data linking L-type calcium channels blockers to CRAC channels and heart failure.\nAuthors: Bird, G. S.; Lin, Y.-P.; Tucker, C. J.; Mueller, G.; Shi, M.; Padmanabhan, S.; Parekh, A. B.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579229\nHypertension is estimated to affect almost 1 billion people globally and significantly increases risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, retinopathy and kidney disease. One major front line therapy that has been used for over 50 years involves L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). One class of LCCBs is the dihydropyridine family, with amlodipine being widely prescribed regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or age. In 2020, Johnson et al.7 reported that all LCCBs significantly increased the risk of heart failure, and attributed this effect to non-canonical activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. A major approach on which they based many of their arguments was to measure cytosolic Ca2+ using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2. We recently demonstrated that amlodipine is highly fluorescent within cells and overwhelms the fura-2 signal, precluding the use of the indicator dye with amlodipine24. Our meta-analyses and prospective real world study showed that dihydropyridines were not associated with an increase in heart failure, likely explained by the lack of consideration by Johnson et al.7 of well-known confounding factors such as age, race, obesity, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or diabetes24. Trebak and colleagues have responded to our paper with a forthright and unwavering defence of their work27. In this paper, we carry out a forensic dissection of Johnson et al.,7 and conduct new experiments that address directly points raised by Trebak et al. 27. We show that there are major flaws in the design and interpretation of their key experiments, that fura-2 cannot be used with amlodipine, that there are fundamental mathematical misunderstandings and mistakes throughout their study leading to critical calculations on heart failure that are demonstrably wrong, and several of their own results are inconsistent with their interpretation. We therefore believe the study by Johnson et al. 7 is flawed at many levels and we stand by our conclusions.\nRejuvenation of Senescent Cells by Low Frequency Ultrasound without Senolysis\nAuthors: Kureel, S. K.; Maroto, R.; Powell, S.; Margadant, F.; Blair, B.; Rasmussen, B.; Sheetz, M.\nScore: 42.5, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.08.519320\nIt is believed that senescent cells are unable to grow; however, we have treated non-growing senescent cells with low frequency ultrasound (LFU) and they are rejuvenated for growth. Further, the senescent cells are characterized by low levels of motility but LFU treatment significantly increases the level of whole cell and organelle motility. At a mechanistic level, LFU causes Ca2+ entry that precedes dramatic increases in autophagy with the inhibition of mTORC1 and the movement of Sirtuin 1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Other characteristics of senescent cells are also reversed including blocking SASP secretion, restoring telomere length, nuclear 5mc levels, H3K9me3 levels, {gamma}H2AX levels, p53 nuclear staining, ROS and mitoROS levels are all restored to normal levels. Repeated LFU treatments enable expansion of primary cells and stem cells beyond normal replicative limits without altering cell phenotype. Rejuvenation is enhanced by rapamycin and Rho kinase inhibition but inhibited by blocking Sirtuin 1, Piezo1 or TRPV1. Thus, we suggest that mechanical pressure waves similar to those generated by exercise can reverse senescence at the cell level, which provides a way to rejuvenate senescent cells in vivo. One-Sentence SummaryLow frequency ultrasound alone rejuvenates senescent cells by activating autophagy.\nDisrupted cardiac bioenergetics linked to oxidized mitochondrial creatine kinase are rescued by the mitochondrial-targeting peptide SBT-20 in the D2.mdx model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nAuthors: Perry, C. G. R.; Hughes, M. C.; Ramos, S. V.; Brahmbhatt, A.; Turnbull, P. C.; Polidovitch, N.; Garibotti, M. C.; Schlattner, U.; Hawke, T. J.; Simpson, J. A.; Backx, P. H.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578832\nMitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the \"fast\" export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such \"creatine-dependent\" phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. Here, we determined whether such attenuations occur in later stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age) in relation to mtCK thiol redox state, and whether this pathway could be preserved through administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20, in the D2.mdx mouse. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that aged male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H2O2 emission (mH2O2). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH2O2 was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). We then found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4 to [~]12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH2O2 only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation, which can be preserved with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationships between redox stress and metabolic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency that can be targeted with small peptide therapeutics.\nATP Citrate Lyase Drives Vascular Remodeling Diseases Development Through Metabolic-Epigenetic Reprograming.\nAuthors: Grobs, Y.; Romanet, C.; Lemay, S.-E.; Bourgeois, A.; Voisine, P.; Theberge, C.; Sauvaget, M.; Breuils-Bonnet, S.; Martineau, S.; El-kabbout, R.; Mougin, M.; Dumais, E.; Perron, J.; Flamand, N.; Potus, F.; Provencher, S.; Boucherat, O.; Bonnet, s.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578545\nOur study explores the previously uncharted role of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) in vascular remodeling within the pulmonary and coronary arteries, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery diseases. ACLY, involved in de novo lipid synthesis and histone acetylation, has emerged as a key regulator in sustaining vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and survival. Utilizing human coronary and pulmonary artery tissues, our findings reveal an upregulation of ACLY expression during vascular remodeling processes. Inhibition of ACLY, achieved through pharmacological and molecular interventions in humans primary cultured VSMCs, leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Mechanistically, these effects are associated with diminished glycolysis, lipid synthesis, GCN5-dependent histone acetylation, and FOXM1 activation. In vivo experiments, combining pharmacological and VSMC-specific ACLY knockout mice, ACLY inhibition demonstrates its efficacy in mitigating coronary artery remodeling and reducing pulmonary hypertension. Notably, initiating ACLY inhibition post-disease onset reverses pathological conditions, positioning ACLY as a promising therapeutic target. Human ex vivo tissue culture further supports our findings, showing reduced vascular remodeling in cultured human coronary artery rings and a reversal of pulmonary artery remodeling in precision-cut lung slices upon ACLY inhibition. This study introduces a groundbreaking concept, linking disparate abnormalities in vascular diseases to a common pathogenetic denominator, ACLY. The identified \"multiple hit\" therapeutic approach presents potential targets for addressing complex vascular diseases, offering avenues for future clinical interventions. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYOur study delineates the pivotal role of ATP-citrate lyase in orchestrating vascular remodeling, establishing it as a compelling translational target for therapeutic interventions in pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease.\nMUC17 is an essential small intestinal glycocalyx component that is disrupted in Crohn's disease\nAuthors: Layunta, E.; Javerfelt, S.; van de Koolwijk, F. C.; Sivertsson, M.; Dolan, B.; Arike, L.; Thulin, S.; Vallance, B. A.; Pelaseyed, T.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.578867\nCrohn's disease (CD) is the chronic inflammation of the ileum and colon triggered by bacteria, but insights into molecular perturbations at the bacteria-epithelium interface are limited. We report that membrane mucin MUC17 protects small intestinal enterocytes against commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In non-inflamed CD ileum, reduced MUC17 levels correlated with a compromised glycocalyx, allowing bacterial contact with enterocytes. Muc17 deletion in mice rendered the small intestine prone to atypical infection while maintaining resistance to colitis. The loss of Muc17 resulted in spontaneous deterioration of epithelial homeostasis and extra-intestinal translocation of bacteria. Finally, Muc17-deficient mice harbored specific small intestinal bacterial taxa observed in CD. Our findings highlight MUC17 as an essential line of defense in the small intestine with relevance for early epithelial defects in CD.\nNanoligomers targeting NF-κB and NLRP3 reduce neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function with aging and tauopathy\nAuthors: Wahl, D.; Risen, S. J.; Osburn, S. C.; Emge, T.; Sharma, S.; Gilberto, V. S.; Chatterjee, A.; Nagpal, P.; Moreno, J. A.; LaRocca, T. J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.578493\nNeuroinflammation contributes to impaired cognitive function in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, which is characterized by the aggregation of pathological tau. One major driver of both age- and tau-associated neuroinflammation is the NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 signaling axis. However, current treatments targeting NF-{kappa}B or NLRP3 may have adverse/systemic effects, and most have not been clinically translatable. Here, we tested the efficacy of a novel, nucleic acid therapeutic (Nanoligomer) cocktail specifically targeting both NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 in the brain for reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function in old wildtype mice, and in a mouse model of tauopathy. We found that 4 weeks of NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomer treatment strongly reduced neuro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the brain and improved cognitive-behavioral function in both old and tauopathy mice. These effects of NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomer treatment were associated with reduced glial cell activation in old wildtype mice, less pathology in tauopathy mice, favorable changes in transcriptome signatures of inflammation (reduced) and neuronal health (increased) in both mouse models, and positive systemic effects. Collectively, our results provide a basis for future translational studies targeting NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3 in the brain, perhaps using Nanoligomers, to inhibit neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function with aging and neurodegenerative disease.\nOsteochondroprogenitor cells and neutrophils expressing p21 and senescence markers modulate fracture repair\nAuthors: Saul, D.; Doolittle, M. L.; Rowsey, J. L.; Froemming, M. N.; Kosinsky, R. L.; Vos, S. J.; Ruan, M.; LeBrasseur, N.; Chandra, A.; Pignolo, R.; Passos, J.; Farr, J. N.; Monroe, D.; Khosla, S.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578420\nCells expressing features of senescence, including upregulation of p21 and p16, appear transiently following tissue injury, yet the properties of these cells or how they contrast with age-induced senescent cells remains unclear. Here, we used skeletal injury as a model and identified the rapid appearance following fracture of p21+ cells expressing senescence markers, mainly as osteochondroprogenitors (OCHs) and neutrophils. Targeted genetic clearance of p21+ cells suppressed senescence-associated signatures within the fracture callus and accelerated fracture healing. By contrast, p21+ cell clearance did not alter bone loss due to aging; conversely, p16+ cell clearance, known to alleviate skeletal aging, did not affect fracture healing. Following fracture, p21+ neutrophils were enriched in signaling pathways known to induce paracrine stromal senescence, while p21+ OCHs were highly enriched in senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors known to impair bone formation. Further analysis revealed an injury-specific stem cell-like OCH subset that was p21+ and highly inflammatory, with a similar inflammatory mesenchymal population (fibro-adipogenic progenitors) evident following muscle injury. Thus, intercommunicating senescent-like neutrophils and mesenchymal progenitor cells are key regulators of tissue repair in bone and potentially across tissues. Moreover, our findings establish contextual roles of p21+ vs p16+ senescent/senescent-like cells that may be leveraged for therapeutic opportunities.\nAugmented-reality-based exercise increases salivary oxytocin\nAuthors: Shima, T.; Iijima, J.; Sutoh, H.; Terashima, C.; Matsuura, Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579578\nPurpose: The secretion of oxytocin, which is linked to social interaction, plays a significant role in enhancing human well-being. The utilization of augmented reality (AR) systems can facilitate sustained social interaction irrespective of physical distance. While exercise and sports activities are known to promote oxytocin secretion, the potential benefits of exercise combined with AR remain to be fully explored. Methods: In a randomized crossover trial, fourteen participants underwent three different regimens: non-exercise (rest), standard cycling exercise (Ex), and cycling exercise combined with AR (Ex+AR). In both exercise conditions (Ex and Ex+AR), participants engaged in self-paced cycling exercises to maintain a Rating of Perceived Exertion of 10. In the Ex+AR condition, participants' avatars were projected onto the tablet screen as they cycled alongside ten other avatars in AR. Saliva samples and mood states (assessed using POMS2) were collected before and immediately after each 10-minute regimen. Subsequently, the levels of salivary oxytocin were measured. Results: The participants demonstrated a faster speed during Ex+AR compared to Ex, despite there was no difference in self-administered fatigue levels between the two groups. Notably, Ex+AR led to a significant elevation in salivary oxytocin levels, whereas Ex showed a trend toward an increase. Furthermore, only Ex+AR significantly ameliorated mood states related to depression-dejection and exhibited a trend toward suppressing anger-hostility. Conclusion: These results indicate that Ex+AR facilitates oxytocin secretion and enhances mood states. Employing the Ex+AR system could be a promising means to foster social interaction, transcending physical distances.\nAge, not body size, influences flight distance in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)\nAuthors: Gilgenreiner, M.; Kurze, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579366\nBumble bees and honey bees provide crucial pollination service and have become important insect model system. Despite their close relation, they differ in their morphology, physiology, and social organisation. Notably, honey bees workers exhibit age-based polyethism, while bumble bees display considerable body size variation. Though body size is known to affect foraging range, behaviour, and flight ability, the influence of age remains less explored. Here we studied the flight performance (distance and speed) in aging bumble bee workers using tethered flight mills. Additionally, we measured their intertegular distance (ITD), dry mass, and fat content. Flight distance was predominantly influenced by age, challenging assumptions that age does not play a role in foraging and task allocation. Between 7 to 14 days, flight distance increased six-fold before a slight decline at the age of 21 days, aligning with age-dependent flight physiology in honey bees. Larger workers had decreasing mass-specific fat reserves, challenging the notion about their energy preservation for oocyte development. Our findings indicate that age substantially influences flight distance, impacting foraging performance and potentially altering task allocation strategies. This underscores the need to consider individual age and physiological changes alongside body size and mass in experiments involving bumble bee workers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Insects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain their nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. While the identities and functions of various insect metabolic and diuretic hormones have been well-established, the characterization of an anti-diuretic signaling system that is conserved across most insects is still lacking. To address this, here we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in Drosophila. The Drosophila ITP gene encodes five transcript variants which generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. Using a combination of anatomical mapping and single-cell transcriptome analyses, we comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa is released during dehydration and recombinant Drosophila ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach and the ex vivo secretion assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as an elusive Drosophila ITPa receptor. Thus, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules abolishes the inhibitory effect of ITPa on diuretic hormone secretion. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with ITPa overexpression in ITP neurons. Interestingly, ITPa-Gyc76C pathways deciphered here are reminiscent of the atrial natriuretic peptide signaling in mammals. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify synaptic and paracrine pathways upstream and downstream of ITP-expressing neurons. Taken together, our systematic characterization of the ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hypertension is estimated to affect almost 1 billion people globally and significantly increases risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, retinopathy and kidney disease. One major front line therapy that has been used for over 50 years involves L-type Ca2&#43; channel blockers (LCCBs). One class of LCCBs is the dihydropyridine family, with amlodipine being widely prescribed regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or age. In 2020, Johnson et al.7 reported that all LCCBs significantly increased the risk of heart failure, and attributed this effect to non-canonical activation of store-operated Ca2&#43; entry. A major approach on which they based many of their arguments was to measure cytosolic Ca2&#43; using the fluorescent Ca2&#43; indicator dye fura-2. We recently demonstrated that amlodipine is highly fluorescent within cells and overwhelms the fura-2 signal, precluding the use of the indicator dye with amlodipine24. Our meta-analyses and prospective real world study showed that dihydropyridines were not associated with an increase in heart failure, likely explained by the lack of consideration by Johnson et al.7 of well-known confounding factors such as age, race, obesity, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or diabetes24. Trebak and colleagues have responded to our paper with a forthright and unwavering defence of their work27. In this paper, we carry out a forensic dissection of Johnson et al.,7 and conduct new experiments that address directly points raised by Trebak et al. 27. We show that there are major flaws in the design and interpretation of their key experiments, that fura-2 cannot be used with amlodipine, that there are fundamental mathematical misunderstandings and mistakes throughout their study leading to critical calculations on heart failure that are demonstrably wrong, and several of their own results are inconsistent with their interpretation. We therefore believe the study by Johnson et al. 7 is flawed at many levels and we stand by our conclusions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is believed that senescent cells are unable to grow; however, we have treated non-growing senescent cells with low frequency ultrasound (LFU) and they are rejuvenated for growth. Further, the senescent cells are characterized by low levels of motility but LFU treatment significantly increases the level of whole cell and organelle motility. At a mechanistic level, LFU causes Ca2&#43; entry that precedes dramatic increases in autophagy with the inhibition of mTORC1 and the movement of Sirtuin 1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Other characteristics of senescent cells are also reversed including blocking SASP secretion, restoring telomere length, nuclear 5mc levels, H3K9me3 levels, {gamma}H2AX levels, p53 nuclear staining, ROS and mitoROS levels are all restored to normal levels. Repeated LFU treatments enable expansion of primary cells and stem cells beyond normal replicative limits without altering cell phenotype. Rejuvenation is enhanced by rapamycin and Rho kinase inhibition but inhibited by blocking Sirtuin 1, Piezo1 or TRPV1. Thus, we suggest that mechanical pressure waves similar to those generated by exercise can reverse senescence at the cell level, which provides a way to rejuvenate senescent cells in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the &#34;fast&#34; export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such &#34;creatine-dependent&#34; phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. Here, we determined whether such attenuations occur in later stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age) in relation to mtCK thiol redox state, and whether this pathway could be preserved through administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20, in the D2.mdx mouse. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that aged male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H2O2 emission (mH2O2). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH2O2 was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). We then found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4 to [~]12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH2O2 only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation, which can be preserved with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationships between redox stress and metabolic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency that can be targeted with small peptide therapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our study explores the previously uncharted role of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) in vascular remodeling within the pulmonary and coronary arteries, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery diseases. ACLY, involved in de novo lipid synthesis and histone acetylation, has emerged as a key regulator in sustaining vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and survival.

Utilizing human coronary and pulmonary artery tissues, our findings reveal an upregulation of ACLY expression during vascular remodeling processes. Inhibition of ACLY, achieved through pharmacological and molecular interventions in humans primary cultured VSMCs, leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Mechanistically, these effects are associated with diminished glycolysis, lipid synthesis, GCN5-dependent histone acetylation, and FOXM1 activation.

In vivo experiments, combining pharmacological and VSMC-specific ACLY knockout mice, ACLY inhibition demonstrates its efficacy in mitigating coronary artery remodeling and reducing pulmonary hypertension. Notably, initiating ACLY inhibition post-disease onset reverses pathological conditions, positioning ACLY as a promising therapeutic target.

Human ex vivo tissue culture further supports our findings, showing reduced vascular remodeling in cultured human coronary artery rings and a reversal of pulmonary artery remodeling in precision-cut lung slices upon ACLY inhibition. This study introduces a groundbreaking concept, linking disparate abnormalities in vascular diseases to a common pathogenetic denominator, ACLY. The identified &#34;multiple hit&#34; therapeutic approach presents potential targets for addressing complex vascular diseases, offering avenues for future clinical interventions.

        <p class="abstract">Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) is the chronic inflammation of the ileum and colon triggered by bacteria, but insights into molecular perturbations at the bacteria-epithelium interface are limited. We report that membrane mucin MUC17 protects small intestinal enterocytes against commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In non-inflamed CD ileum, reduced MUC17 levels correlated with a compromised glycocalyx, allowing bacterial contact with enterocytes. Muc17 deletion in mice rendered the small intestine prone to atypical infection while maintaining resistance to colitis. The loss of Muc17 resulted in spontaneous deterioration of epithelial homeostasis and extra-intestinal translocation of bacteria. Finally, Muc17-deficient mice harbored specific small intestinal bacterial taxa observed in CD. Our findings highlight MUC17 as an essential line of defense in the small intestine with relevance for early epithelial defects in CD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuroinflammation contributes to impaired cognitive function in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, which is characterized by the aggregation of pathological tau. One major driver of both age- and tau-associated neuroinflammation is the NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 signaling axis. However, current treatments targeting NF-{kappa}B or NLRP3 may have adverse/systemic effects, and most have not been clinically translatable. Here, we tested the efficacy of a novel, nucleic acid therapeutic (Nanoligomer) cocktail specifically targeting both NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 in the brain for reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function in old wildtype mice, and in a mouse model of tauopathy. We found that 4 weeks of NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomer treatment strongly reduced neuro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the brain and improved cognitive-behavioral function in both old and tauopathy mice. These effects of NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomer treatment were associated with reduced glial cell activation in old wildtype mice, less pathology in tauopathy mice, favorable changes in transcriptome signatures of inflammation (reduced) and neuronal health (increased) in both mouse models, and positive systemic effects. Collectively, our results provide a basis for future translational studies targeting NF-{kappa}B/NLRP3 in the brain, perhaps using Nanoligomers, to inhibit neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function with aging and neurodegenerative disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cells expressing features of senescence, including upregulation of p21 and p16, appear transiently following tissue injury, yet the properties of these cells or how they contrast with age-induced senescent cells remains unclear. Here, we used skeletal injury as a model and identified the rapid appearance following fracture of p21&#43; cells expressing senescence markers, mainly as osteochondroprogenitors (OCHs) and neutrophils. Targeted genetic clearance of p21&#43; cells suppressed senescence-associated signatures within the fracture callus and accelerated fracture healing. By contrast, p21&#43; cell clearance did not alter bone loss due to aging; conversely, p16&#43; cell clearance, known to alleviate skeletal aging, did not affect fracture healing. Following fracture, p21&#43; neutrophils were enriched in signaling pathways known to induce paracrine stromal senescence, while p21&#43; OCHs were highly enriched in senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors known to impair bone formation. Further analysis revealed an injury-specific stem cell-like OCH subset that was p21&#43; and highly inflammatory, with a similar inflammatory mesenchymal population (fibro-adipogenic progenitors) evident following muscle injury. Thus, intercommunicating senescent-like neutrophils and mesenchymal progenitor cells are key regulators of tissue repair in bone and potentially across tissues. Moreover, our findings establish contextual roles of p21&#43; vs p16&#43; senescent/senescent-like cells that may be leveraged for therapeutic opportunities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: The secretion of oxytocin, which is linked to social interaction, plays a significant role in enhancing human well-being. The utilization of augmented reality (AR) systems can facilitate sustained social interaction irrespective of physical distance. While exercise and sports activities are known to promote oxytocin secretion, the potential benefits of exercise combined with AR remain to be fully explored. Methods: In a randomized crossover trial, fourteen participants underwent three different regimens: non-exercise (rest), standard cycling exercise (Ex), and cycling exercise combined with AR (Ex&#43;AR). In both exercise conditions (Ex and Ex&#43;AR), participants engaged in self-paced cycling exercises to maintain a Rating of Perceived Exertion of 10. In the Ex&#43;AR condition, participants&#39; avatars were projected onto the tablet screen as they cycled alongside ten other avatars in AR. Saliva samples and mood states (assessed using POMS2) were collected before and immediately after each 10-minute regimen. Subsequently, the levels of salivary oxytocin were measured. Results: The participants demonstrated a faster speed during Ex&#43;AR compared to Ex, despite there was no difference in self-administered fatigue levels between the two groups. Notably, Ex&#43;AR led to a significant elevation in salivary oxytocin levels, whereas Ex showed a trend toward an increase. Furthermore, only Ex&#43;AR significantly ameliorated mood states related to depression-dejection and exhibited a trend toward suppressing anger-hostility. Conclusion: These results indicate that Ex&#43;AR facilitates oxytocin secretion and enhances mood states. Employing the Ex&#43;AR system could be a promising means to foster social interaction, transcending physical distances.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bumble bees and honey bees provide crucial pollination service and have become important insect model system. Despite their close relation, they differ in their morphology, physiology, and social organisation. Notably, honey bees workers exhibit age-based polyethism, while bumble bees display considerable body size variation. Though body size is known to affect foraging range, behaviour, and flight ability, the influence of age remains less explored. Here we studied the flight performance (distance and speed) in aging bumble bee workers using tethered flight mills. Additionally, we measured their intertegular distance (ITD), dry mass, and fat content. Flight distance was predominantly influenced by age, challenging assumptions that age does not play a role in foraging and task allocation. Between 7 to 14 days, flight distance increased six-fold before a slight decline at the age of 21 days, aligning with age-dependent flight physiology in honey bees. Larger workers had decreasing mass-specific fat reserves, challenging the notion about their energy preservation for oocyte development. Our findings indicate that age substantially influences flight distance, impacting foraging performance and potentially altering task allocation strategies. This underscores the need to consider individual age and physiological changes alongside body size and mass in experiments involving bumble bee workers.</p>
