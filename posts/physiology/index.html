Mitochondria in HF show changes in structure, while myofibrils exhibit increased cross-sectional area and branching. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses indicate concomitant dysregulation in key pathways. The findings underscore the need for personalized treatments considering individualized structural changes in HF.\nIdentification of conserved gene expression programs activated in multiple modes of torpor across vertebrate clades.\nAuthors: Weir, K.; Vega, N.; Busa, V.; Sajdak, B.; Kallestad, L.; Merriman, D.; Palczewski, K.; Carroll, J.; Blackshaw, S.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569284\nTorpor encompasses adaptations to diverse extreme environmental stressors such as hibernation, aestivation, brumation, and daily torpor. Here we introduce StrokeofGenus, an analytic pipeline that identifies distinct transcriptomic states and conservation of gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species. We use StrokeofGenus to study multiple and diverse forms of torpor from publicly available RNA-seq datasets that span eight species and two classes. We identify three transcriptionally distinct states during the cycle of heterothermia: euthermia, torpor, and interbout arousal. We also identify torpor-specific gene expression patterns that are conserved both across tissues and between species with over three hundred million years of evolutionary divergence. We further demonstrate the general conservation of gene expression patterns in multiple forms of torpor, implying a common evolutionary origin for this process. Although here we apply StrokeofGenus to analysis of torpor, it can be used to interrogate any other complex physiological processes defined by transient transcriptomic states. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIStrokeofGenus integrates orthologue annotation, non-negative matrix factorization, and transfer learning for cross-species analysis. C_LIO_LIStrokeofGenus identifies conserved topor-related gene expression patterns across divergent species and cell types. C_LIO_LIHeterothermia has three distinct transcriptomic states. C_LIO_LITorpor-specific gene expression patterns are conserved between species and forms of torpor. C_LI\nMicrobiota-dependent early life programming of gastrointestinal motility\nAuthors: Frith, M. E.; Kashyap, P. C.; Linden, D. R.; Theriault, B.; Chang, E. B.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566304\nGastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.\nHuman skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity beyond myosin heavy chains\nAuthors: Moreno-Justicia, R.; Van der Stede, T.; Stocks, B.; Laitila, J.; Seaborne, R. A.; Van de Loock, A.; Lievens, E.; Samodova, D.; Marin-Arraiza, L.; Dmytriyeva, O.; Van Vossel, K.; Yigit, N.; Anckaert, J.; Weyns, A.; Van Thienen, R.; Sahl, R. E.; Zanoteli, E.; Wierer, M.; Mestdagh, P.; Lawlor, M. W.; Vandesompele, J.; Ochala, J.; Hostrup, M.; Derave, W.; Deshmukh, A. S.\nScore: 64.2, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556665\nSkeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one \"slow\" (type 1) and two \"fast\" (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

B.; Stroud, D. A.; Granata, C.; Chandrasiri, S.; Ramm, G.; Oorschot, V.; Caruana, N. J.; Bishop, D. J.\nScore: 40.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.23.512956\nAnalyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.\nThe Cardiac Calcium Handling Machinery is Remodeled in Friedreich's Ataxia\nAuthors: Czornobil, R.; Assali, O. A.-; Wood, E. R.-; Lynch, D. R.; Noujaim, S. F.; Chidipi, B.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566141\nBackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis. ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2+ handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA. MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT. ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nAging impairs muscle regeneration by desynchronizing matrix mechano-signaling and macrophage immunomodulation via fibro-adipogenic progenitors\nAuthors: Garcia-Carrizo, F.; Gohlke, S.; Lenihan-Geels, G.; Jank, A.-M.; Leer, M.; Soultoukis, G. A.; Oveisi, M.; Herpich, C.; Garrido, C. A.; Kotsaris, G.; Poehle-Kronawitter, S.; Tsamo-Tetou, A.; Graja, A.; Ost, M.; Villacorta, L.; Knecht, R. S.; Klaus, S.; Schuermann, A.; Stricker, S.; Schmidt-Bleek, K.; Cipitria, A.; Duda, G. N.; Benes, V.; Mueller-Werdan, U.; Norman, K.; Schulz, T. J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568776\nSkeletal muscle regeneration depends on the function of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Here we show that aging impairs myogenic stem cells and immunomodulatory processes by disrupting extracellular matrix function, thereby inhibiting regeneration in aged muscle. We identify the FAP-secreted matricellular protein Periostin as a niche factor that is decreased in aged murine muscle and in circulation of aged humans with low-exercise lifestyle. Periostin controls FAP-expansion after injury and its loss fate-regulates FAPs to contribute to fibro/fatty infiltration. This causes stem cell defects and attenuates pro- to anti-inflammatory macrophage transition during regeneration. Transplantation of young FAPs with high Periostin secretion, but not Periostin-deficient FAPs, into aged muscle restores anti-inflammatory niche formation and regeneration. Mechanistically, Periostin activates Focal adhesion kinase- and AKT-signaling in macrophages via integrin binding to promote an anti-inflammatory profile, which synchronizes matrix-derived mechanosensory signaling and immunomodulation. These results uncover a key role of FAP-based matrix regulation via niche factors that orchestrate successful muscle regeneration.\nDefining the in vivo role of mTORC1 in thyrocytes by studying the TSC2 conditional knockout mouse model\nAuthors: Rossetti, C. L.; Lourenconi, B.; Pecanha, F. L. M.; Franco, A. T.; Nose, V.; Lew, J.; Carneiro, E.; Bernal-Mizrachi, E.; Werneck de Castro, J. P.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565171\nThe thyroid gland is susceptible to abnormal epithelial cell growth, often resulting in thyroid dysfunction. The serine-threonine protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth through two different protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathways overactivity is well associated with heightened aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, but recent studies indicate the involvement of mTORC2 as well. To elucidate mTORC1s role in thyrocytes, we developed a novel mouse model with mTORC1 gain of function in thyrocytes by deleting Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an intracellular inhibitor of mTORC1. The resulting TPO-TSC2KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in TSC2 levels, leading to a six-fold increase in mTORC1 activity. Thyroid glands of both male and female TPO-TSC2KO mice displayed rapid enlargement and continued growth throughout life, accompanied by heterogeneity among thyroid follicles, larger follicles, increased colloid and epithelium. We observed elevated thyrocyte proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining and elevated Cyclin D3 expression in the TPO-TSC2KO mice. mTORC1 activation resulted in a progressive downregulation of key genes involved in thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis, including thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), while TTF1, PAX8, and MCT8 mRNA levels remained unaffected. NIS protein expression was also diminished in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented thyroid mass expansion and restored the gene expression alterations in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Although T4, T3 and TSH plasma levels were normal at 2 months of age, a slight decrease in T4 and an increase in TSH levels were observed at 6 and 12 months of age while T3 remained similar in TPO-TSC2KO compared to littermate control mice. TPO-TSC2KO mice aged to 12 months or older developed aberrant thyroid conditions, including follicular hyperplasia, inflammation, and thyroid tumors. In conclusion, our thyrocyte-specific mouse model reveals that mTORC1 activation inhibits TH biosynthesis, suppresses thyrocyte gene expression, and promotes growth and proliferation. Chronic mTORC1 activation leads to thyroid tumor formation, highlighting the role of mTORC1 in thyroid dysfunction and tumorigenesis.\nThe SCN8A p.(Gly1625Arg) variant associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy causes complex biophysical changes and reduced neuronal firing\nAuthors: Quinn, S.; Zhang, N.; Fenton, T. A.; Brusel, M.; Muruganandam, P.; Peleg, Y.; Giladi, M.; Haitin, Y.; Lerche, H.; Bassan, H.; Liu, Y.; Ben-Shalom, R.; Rubinstein, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569940\nMutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, result in a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes. The p.(Gly1625Arg) (G1625R) mutation was identified in a patient diagnosed with Developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), presenting with moderate epilepsy and severe developmental delay. This variant is positioned within the S4 segment of domain IV, a critical region for Nav1.6 function where pathogenic variants were shown to cause either a loss or gain of channel function, but often with mixed biophysical alterations. Voltage-clamp analyses of Nav1.6G1625R demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of gain- and loss-of-function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and increased channel availability with high-frequency repeated depolarization. Further studies using current clamp analyses in transfected cultured neurons showed that these intricate biophysical properties had a minor effect on neuronal excitability when firing relayed on both the endogenous and transfected Nav channels. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in the number of action potentials when the firing was driven solely by the transfected TTX-resistant mutant Nav1.6 compared to WT Nav1.6 channels. Moreover, using a computational model of mature cortical neurons, we revealed a mild reduction of neuronal firing when mimicking the patients heterozygous SCN8A expression. Structural modeling of Nav1.6G1625R, using the cryo-EM structure of Nav1.6, suggested the possible formation of cation-pi interaction between R1625 and F1588 within domain IV. Double-mutant cycle analysis demonstrated that this functional interaction affects the voltage dependence of inactivation in Nav1.6G1625R. Together, our analyses demonstrate a complex combination of gain and loss of function biophysical changes that result in an overall mild reduction in neuronal firing, related to the perturbed interaction network within the voltage sensor domain.\nAge-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are moreaffected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging\nAuthors: Kurochkina, N. S.; Orlova, M. A.; Vigovskiy, M. A.; Vepkhvadze, T. F.; Zgoda, V. G.; Vavilov, N. E.; Makhnovskii, P. A.; Grigorieva, O. A.; Boroday, Y. R.; Philippov, V. V.; Lednev, E. M.; Efimenko, A. Y.; Popov, D. V.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569524\nEvaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression (~4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes (~200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Torpor encompasses adaptations to diverse extreme environmental stressors such as hibernation, aestivation, brumation, and daily torpor. Here we introduce StrokeofGenus, an analytic pipeline that identifies distinct transcriptomic states and conservation of gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species. We use StrokeofGenus to study multiple and diverse forms of torpor from publicly available RNA-seq datasets that span eight species and two classes. We identify three transcriptionally distinct states during the cycle of heterothermia: euthermia, torpor, and interbout arousal. We also identify torpor-specific gene expression patterns that are conserved both across tissues and between species with over three hundred million years of evolutionary divergence. We further demonstrate the general conservation of gene expression patterns in multiple forms of torpor, implying a common evolutionary origin for this process. Although here we apply StrokeofGenus to analysis of torpor, it can be used to interrogate any other complex physiological processes defined by transient transcriptomic states.

        <p class="abstract">Gastrointestinal microbes modulate peristalsis and stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), whose development, as in the central nervous system (CNS), continues into the murine postweaning period. Given that adult CNS function depends on stimuli received during critical periods of postnatal development, we hypothesized that adult ENS function, namely motility, depends on microbial stimuli during similar critical periods. We gave fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to germ-free mice at weaning or as adults and found that only the mice given FMT at weaning recovered normal transit, while those given FMT as adults showed limited improvements. RNAseq of colonic muscularis propria revealed enrichments in neuron developmental pathways in mice exposed to gut microbes earlier in life, while mice exposed later - or not at all - showed exaggerated expression of inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight a microbiota-dependent sensitive period in ENS development, pointing to potential roles of the early life microbiome in later life dysmotility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle is an inherently heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, which are historically classified into three distinct fiber types in humans: one &#34;slow&#34; (type 1) and two &#34;fast&#34; (type 2A and type 2X), delineated by the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYHs)1. However, whether discrete fiber types exist or whether fiber heterogeneity reflects a continuum remains unclear. Furthermore, whether MYHs are the main classifiers of skeletal muscle fibers has not been examined in an unbiased manner. Through the development and application of novel transcriptomic and proteomic workflows, applied to 1050 and 1038 single muscle fibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively, we show that MYHs are not the principal drivers of skeletal muscle fiber heterogeneity. Instead, ribosomal heterogeneity and cell junction proteins drive the majority of variance between skeletal muscle fibers in a continual fashion, independent of slow/fast fiber type. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters can be identified, described by their contractile and metabolic profiles, our data challenge the concept that type 2X are phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers at an omics level. Moreover, MYH-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of skeletal muscle fibers in one of the most common genetic muscle diseases, nemaline myopathy, with fibers shifting towards a non-oxidative phenotype independently of MYH-based fiber type. Instead, we characterize novel transcriptomic and proteomic features of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers, including identifying several muscle fiber type-specific polypeptides, termed microproteins, encoded by transcripts annotated as non-coding RNA. Overall, our data challenges the currently accepted model of multiple distinct fiber types defined by the expression of specific MYHs, and proposes new avenues for skeletal muscle research.

        <p class="abstract">Analyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFriedreichs ataxia (FA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive nervous system damage resulting in impaired muscle coordination. FA is the most common autosomal recessive form of ataxia and is caused by an expansion of the DNA triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in the first intron of the Frataxin gene (FXN), located on chromosome 9q13. In the unaffected population, the number of GAA repeats ranges from 6 to 27 repetitions. In FA patients, GAA repeat expansions range from 44 to 1,700 repeats which decreases frataxin protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein essential for various cellular functions, including iron metabolism. Reduced frataxin expression is thought to negatively affect mitochondrial iron metabolism, leading to increased oxidative damage. Although FA is considered a neurodegenerative disorder, FA patients display heart disease that includes hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac fibrosis.

ObjectiveIn this work, we investigated whether abnormal Ca2&#43; handling machinery is the molecular mechanism that perpetuates cardiac dysfunction in FA.

MethodsWe used the frataxin knock-out (FXN-KO) mouse model of FA as well as human heart samples from donors with FA and from unaffected donors. ECG and echocardiography were used to assess cardiac function in the mice. Expression of calcium handling machinery proteins was assessed with proteomics and western blot. In left ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO and FXN-WT mice, the IonOptix system was used for calcium imaging, the seahorse assay was utilized to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and confocal imaging was used to quantify the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

ResultsWe found that major contractile proteins, including SERCA2a and Ryr2, were downregulated in human left ventricular samples from deceased donors with FA compared to unaffected donors, similar to the downregulation of these proteins in the left ventricular tissue from FXN-KO compared to FXN-WT. On the ECG, the RR, PR, QRS, and QTc were significantly longer in the FXN-KO mice compared to FXN-WT. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly decreased and left ventricular wall thickness and diameter were significantly increased in the FXN-KO mice versus FXN-WT. The mitochondrial membrane potential {Delta}{psi}m was depolarized, ROS levels were elevated, and OCR was decreased in ventricular myocytes from FXN-KO versus FXN-WT.

ConclusionThe development of left ventricular contractile dysfunction in FA is associated with reduced expression of calcium handling proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Skeletal muscle regeneration depends on the function of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Here we show that aging impairs myogenic stem cells and immunomodulatory processes by disrupting extracellular matrix function, thereby inhibiting regeneration in aged muscle. We identify the FAP-secreted matricellular protein Periostin as a niche factor that is decreased in aged murine muscle and in circulation of aged humans with low-exercise lifestyle. Periostin controls FAP-expansion after injury and its loss fate-regulates FAPs to contribute to fibro/fatty infiltration. This causes stem cell defects and attenuates pro- to anti-inflammatory macrophage transition during regeneration. Transplantation of young FAPs with high Periostin secretion, but not Periostin-deficient FAPs, into aged muscle restores anti-inflammatory niche formation and regeneration. Mechanistically, Periostin activates Focal adhesion kinase- and AKT-signaling in macrophages via integrin binding to promote an anti-inflammatory profile, which synchronizes matrix-derived mechanosensory signaling and immunomodulation. These results uncover a key role of FAP-based matrix regulation via niche factors that orchestrate successful muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The thyroid gland is susceptible to abnormal epithelial cell growth, often resulting in thyroid dysfunction. The serine-threonine protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, and growth through two different protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathways overactivity is well associated with heightened aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, but recent studies indicate the involvement of mTORC2 as well. To elucidate mTORC1s role in thyrocytes, we developed a novel mouse model with mTORC1 gain of function in thyrocytes by deleting Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an intracellular inhibitor of mTORC1. The resulting TPO-TSC2KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in TSC2 levels, leading to a six-fold increase in mTORC1 activity. Thyroid glands of both male and female TPO-TSC2KO mice displayed rapid enlargement and continued growth throughout life, accompanied by heterogeneity among thyroid follicles, larger follicles, increased colloid and epithelium. We observed elevated thyrocyte proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining and elevated Cyclin D3 expression in the TPO-TSC2KO mice. mTORC1 activation resulted in a progressive downregulation of key genes involved in thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis, including thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), while TTF1, PAX8, and MCT8 mRNA levels remained unaffected. NIS protein expression was also diminished in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented thyroid mass expansion and restored the gene expression alterations in TPO-TSC2KO mice. Although T4, T3 and TSH plasma levels were normal at 2 months of age, a slight decrease in T4 and an increase in TSH levels were observed at 6 and 12 months of age while T3 remained similar in TPO-TSC2KO compared to littermate control mice. TPO-TSC2KO mice aged to 12 months or older developed aberrant thyroid conditions, including follicular hyperplasia, inflammation, and thyroid tumors. In conclusion, our thyrocyte-specific mouse model reveals that mTORC1 activation inhibits TH biosynthesis, suppresses thyrocyte gene expression, and promotes growth and proliferation. Chronic mTORC1 activation leads to thyroid tumor formation, highlighting the role of mTORC1 in thyroid dysfunction and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in the SCN8A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, result in a range of neurodevelopmental syndromes. The p.(Gly1625Arg) (G1625R) mutation was identified in a patient diagnosed with Developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), presenting with moderate epilepsy and severe developmental delay. This variant is positioned within the S4 segment of domain IV, a critical region for Nav1.6 function where pathogenic variants were shown to cause either a loss or gain of channel function, but often with mixed biophysical alterations. Voltage-clamp analyses of Nav1.6G1625R demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of gain- and loss-of-function properties, including reduced current amplitudes, a marked increase in the time constant of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and increased channel availability with high-frequency repeated depolarization. Further studies using current clamp analyses in transfected cultured neurons showed that these intricate biophysical properties had a minor effect on neuronal excitability when firing relayed on both the endogenous and transfected Nav channels. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in the number of action potentials when the firing was driven solely by the transfected TTX-resistant mutant Nav1.6 compared to WT Nav1.6 channels. Moreover, using a computational model of mature cortical neurons, we revealed a mild reduction of neuronal firing when mimicking the patients heterozygous SCN8A expression. Structural modeling of Nav1.6G1625R, using the cryo-EM structure of Nav1.6, suggested the possible formation of cation-pi interaction between R1625 and F1588 within domain IV. Double-mutant cycle analysis demonstrated that this functional interaction affects the voltage dependence of inactivation in Nav1.6G1625R. Together, our analyses demonstrate a complex combination of gain and loss of function biophysical changes that result in an overall mild reduction in neuronal firing, related to the perturbed interaction network within the voltage sensor domain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity - the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression (~4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes (~200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.</p>
