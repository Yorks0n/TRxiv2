D.\nScore: 78.7, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545949\nPurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes. MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test. ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (+) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {+/-} SE, -1.6 {+/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {+/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {+/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius+minimus [-1.8 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {+/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {+/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {+/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {+/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {+/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {+/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {+/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes. ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.\nAster-dependent non-vesicular transport facilitates dietary cholesterol uptake\nAuthors: Ferrari, A.; Whang, E.; Xiao, X.; Kennelly, J.

Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption. One-Sentence SummaryIdentification of a targetable pathway for regulation of dietary cholesterol absorption\nLabile assembly of a tardigrade protein induces biostasis\nAuthors: Sanchez-Martinez, S.; Nguyen, K.; Biswas, S.; Nicholson, V.; Romanyuk, A.

C.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547219\nTardigrades are microscopic animals that survive desiccation by inducing biostasis. To survive drying tardigrades rely on intrinsically disordered CAHS proteins that form gels. However, the sequence features and mechanisms underlying gel formation and the necessity of gelation for protection have not been demonstrated. Here we report a mechanism of gelation for CAHS D similar to that of intermediate filaments. We show that gelation restricts molecular motion, immobilizing and protecting labile material from the harmful effects of drying. In vivo, we observe that CAHS D forms fiber-like condensates during osmotic stress. Condensation of CAHS D improves survival of osmotically shocked cells through at least two mechanisms: reduction of cell volume change and reduction of metabolic activity. Importantly, condensation of CAHS D is reversible and metabolic rates return to control levels after CAHS condensates are resolved. This work provides insights into how tardigrades induce biostasis through the self-assembly of CAHS gels.\nExercise on cytokine responses in males and females: Effect of leucine, HMB and BCAA.\nAuthors: Brown, A. D.; Grammenou, M.; Tee, C. C. L.; Chong, M. C.; Stewart, C. E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548561\nPurposeTo identify the effects of leucine, {beta}-hydroxy {beta}-methylbutyrate (HMB) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) on post-exercise cytokine responses in females and males. MethodsMales (n=53) and females (n=37) completed 100 drop jumps and consumed either no supplement, leucine (3g/d), HMB (3g/d) or BCAA (4.5g/d) from 1d pre to 14d post-exercise. Muscle soreness, squat jumps, chair rises and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at pre, post, 24h, 48h, 7 and 14d. Blood lactate (pre, post), 10 cytokines (pre, 24h, 48h, 7d) and oestradiol (pre, 7d) were also measured. ResultsWithout supplementation post-exercise, soreness was induced in both males (6-fold) and females (5-fold). With supplementation, there were no increases in CK or oestradiol in females and no impact on muscle soreness, performance, or function in both sexes. In males, CK was elevated in untreated (48%) and leucine (69%) conditions vs baseline, but these were suppressed with HMB and BCAA. IL-7 was elevated in females vs males at baseline (6.3-fold), leucine increased IL-7 concentrations in females at 24h (17.0-fold), 48h (5.1-fold) vs males. With HMB, TNFr1- increased in females at 24h (2.2-fold), 48h (2.3-fold) and 7d (2.3-fold) vs males. In males with BCAA, TNFr1- decreased (P=0.06) from pre to 24h (6.8-fold), then increased (P\u003c0.05) from 24 to 48h (8.0-fold). ConclusionAlthough supplements were without effect on soreness following exercise, the cytokine response was evoked by exercise and impacted significantly by leucine, HMB and BCAA in females vs males. This improved cytokine response in females could lead to improved resistance to damage.\nAAV-mediated Delivery of Plakophilin-2a Arrests Progression of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy in Murine Hearts: Preclinical Evidence Supporting Gene Therapy in Humans\nAuthors: van Opbergen, C. J.; Narayanan, B.; Sacramento, C. B.; Stiles, K. M.; Mishra, V.; Frenk, E.; Ricks, D.; Chen, G.; Zhang, M.; Yarabe, P.; Schwartz, J.; Delmar, M.; Herzog, C. D.; Cerrone, M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548590\nBackground: Pathogenic variants in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias and progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. No effective medical therapy is available to prevent and/or arrest the disease. We tested the hypothesis that AAV-mediated delivery of the human PKP2 gene to an adult mammalian heart deficient in PKP2 can arrest disease progression and significantly prolong survival. Methods: Experiments were carried out using a cardiac-specific, tamoxifen (TAM)-activated PKP2 knockout murine model (PKP2-cKO). The potential therapeutic, AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601), is a recombinant AAVrh.74 gene therapy viral vector encoding the human PKP2 variant A (PKP2a). AAVrh.74-PKP2a was delivered to adult mice by a single tail vein injection either before or after TAM-activated PKP2-cKO. PKP2 expression was confirmed by molecular and histopathologic analyses. Cardiac function and disease progression were monitored by survival analyses, echocardiography and electrocardiography. Results: Consistent with prior findings, loss of PKP2 expression caused 100% mortality within 50 days after TAM injection. In contrast, AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated PKP2a expression resulted in 100% survival for more than 5 months (at study termination). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that AAVrh.74-PKP2a prevented right ventricle dilation, arrested left ventricle functional decline, and mitigated arrhythmia burden. Molecular and histological analysis showed AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated transgene mRNA and protein expression and appropriate PKP2 localization at the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Importantly, therapeutic benefit was shown in mice receiving AAVrh.74-PKP2a after disease onset. Conclusion: These preclinical data demonstrate the potential for AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601) as a therapeutic for PKP2-related ARVC in both early and more advanced stages of disease.\nThe macronutrient content of a meal modulates subsequent 'dessert' intake, via Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21)\nAuthors: Wu, C.-T.; Larson, K. R.; Sims, L. C.; Ryan, K. K.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547884\nPharmacological administration of Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) alters food choice, including that it decreases the consumption of sucrose and other sweet tastants. Conversely, endogenous secretion of FGF21 by the liver is modulated by diet, such that plasma FGF21 is increased after eating foods that have a low dietary protein: total energy (P: E) ratio. Together, these findings suggest a strategy to promote healthy eating, in which the macronutrient content of a pre-load meal could reduce the later consumption of sweet desserts. Here, we tested the prediction that individuals eating a low P: E pre-load meal, and next offered a highly palatable sweet dessert, would eat less of the sugary snack compared to controls, due to increased FGF21 signaling. In addition to decreasing sweet intake, FGF21 increases the consumption of dietary protein. Thus, we predicted that individuals eating a low protein pre-load meal, and subsequently offered a very high-protein pellet as dessert or snack, would eat more of the high protein pellet compared to controls, and that this depends on FGF21. We tested this in C57Bl/6J, and liver-specific FGF21-null (FGF21{Delta}L) null male and female mice and littermate controls. Contrary to expectation, eating a low protein pre-load did not reduce the later consumption of a sweet solution in either males or females, despite robustly increasing plasma FGF21. Rather, eating the low protein pre-load increased later consumption of a high protein pellet. This was more apparent among males and was abrogated in the FGF21{Delta}L mice. We conclude that physiologic induction of hepatic FGF21 by a low protein pre-load is not sufficient to reduce later consumption of sweet dessert, though it effectively increases the subsequent intake of dietary protein in male mice.\nA co-ordinated transcriptional programme in the maternal liver supplies LC-PUFAs to the conceptus using phospholipids\nAuthors: Amarsi, R.; Furse, S.; Cleaton, M. A.; Maurel, S.; Mitchell, A. L.; Ferguson-Smith, A. C.; Cenac, N.; Williamson, C.; Koulman, A.; Charalambous, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546226\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) and their derivatives, the long and very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), are preferentially transported by the mother to the fetus. Failure to supply EFAs is strongly linked with stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, dietary supplementation during pregnancy is unable to simply reverse these outcomes, suggesting imperfectly understood interactions between dietary EFA intake and the molecular mechanisms of maternal supply. Here we combine untargeted lipidomics with transcriptional profiling of healthy and genetically-manipulated murine models to understand the maternal adaptations required to provide LC-PUFAs to the developing fetus. We discovered a late pregnancy-specific, selective activation of the Liver X Receptor signalling pathway which dramatically increases maternal supply of LC-PUFAs within circulating phospholipids. Crucially, genetic ablation of this pathway in the mother reduced LC-PUFA accumulation by the fetus. Overall our work suggests new molecular strategies for improving maternal-fetal transfer of these important lipids.\nWhen the tap runs dry: The physiological effects of acute experimental dehydration in Peromyscus eremicus\nAuthors: Blumstein, D. M.; MacManes, M. D.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547568\nDesert organisms have evolved physiological, biochemical, and genomic mechanisms to survive the extreme aridity of desert environments. Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements to characterize the response to water-deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 hours of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant weight loss likely related to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared to hydrated males while body temperature decreased for females without access to water compared to hydrated, suggesting daily torpor in females.\nExtracellular lactate as an alternative energy source for retinal bipolar cells\nAuthors: Calbiague Garcia, V.; Chen, Y.; Cadiz, B.; Paquet-Durand, F.; Schmachtenberg, O.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548331\nRetinal bipolar and amacrine cells receive visual information from photoreceptors and participate in the first steps of image processing in the retina. Several studies have suggested the operation of aerobic glycolysis and a lactate shuttle system in the retina due to the high production of this metabolite under aerobic conditions. However, whether bipolar cells form part of this metabolic circuit remains unclear. Here, we show that the lactate transporter MCT2 is functionally expressed in inner retinal neurons and demonstrate their ability to consume extracellular lactate as an alternative to glucose. In rod bipolar cells, lactate is used to maintain homeostasis of various ions and electrical responses. Overall, our data contribute to a better understanding of inner retinal metabolism.\nBio-optical signatures of insitu photosymbionts predict bleaching severity prior to thermal stress in the Caribbean coral species Acropora palmata\nAuthors: Hoadley, K.; Lowry, S.; McQuagge, A.; Dalessandri, S.; Lockridge, G.; Karabelas, E.; Klepac, C. N.; Kenkel, C. D.; Muller, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547971\nThe identification of bleaching tolerant traits among individual corals is a major focus for many restoration and conservation initiatives but often relies on large scale or high-throughput experimental manipulations which may not be accessible to many front-line restoration practitioners. Here we evaluate a machine learning technique to generate a predictive model which estimates bleaching severity using non-destructive chlorophyll-a fluorescence photophysiological metrics measured with a low-cost and open access bio-optical tool. First, a four-week long thermal bleaching experiment was performed on 156 genotypes of Acropora palmata at a land-based restoration facility. Resulting bleaching responses (percent change in Fv/Fm or Absorbance) significantly differed across the four distinct phenotypes generated via a photophysiology-based dendrogram, indicating strong concordance between fluorescence-based photophysiological metrics and future bleaching severity. Next, these correlations were used to train and then test a Random Forest algorithm-based model using a bootstrap resampling technique. Correlation between predicted and actual bleaching responses in test corals was significant (p \u003c 0.0001) and increased with the number of corals used in model training (Peak average R2 values of 0.42 and 0.33 for Fv/Fm and absorbance, respectively). Strong concordance between photophysiology-based phenotypes and future bleaching severity may provide a highly scalable means for assessing reef corals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe examined how set-volume equated resistance training using either the back squat (SQ) or hip thrust (HT) affected hypertrophy and various strength outcomes.

MethodsUntrained college-aged participants were randomized into HT or SQ groups. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) from the right gluteus maximus and medius muscles were obtained during the first training session. Participants completed nine weeks of supervised training (15-17 sessions), before and after which we assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) via magnetic resonance imaging and strength via three-repetition maximum (3RM) testing and an isometric wall push test.

ResultsGlutei mCSA growth was similar across both groups. Estimates [(-) favors HT; (&#43;) favors SQ] modestly favored the HT compared to SQ for lower [effect {&#43;/-} SE, -1.6 {&#43;/-} 2.1 cm2], mid [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 1.7 cm2], and upper [-0.5 {&#43;/-} 2.6 cm2], but with appreciable variance. Gluteus medius&#43;minimus [-1.8 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and hamstrings [0.1 {&#43;/-} 0.6 cm2] mCSA demonstrated little to no growth with small differences between groups. Thigh mCSA changes were greater in SQ for the quadriceps [3.6 {&#43;/-} 1.5 cm2] and adductors [2.5 {&#43;/-} 0.7 cm2]. Squat 3RM increases favored SQ [14 {&#43;/-} 2.5 kg] and hip thrust 3RM favored HT [-26 {&#43;/-} 5 kg]. 3RM deadlift [0 {&#43;/-} 2 kg] and wall push strength [-7 {&#43;/-} 13 N] similarly improved. All measured gluteal sites showed greater mean sEMG amplitudes during the first bout hip thrust versus squat set, but this did not consistently predict gluteal hypertrophy outcomes.

ConclusionNine weeks of squat versus hip thrust training elicited similar gluteal hypertrophy, greater thigh hypertrophy in SQ, strength increases that favored exercise allocation, and similar strength transfers to the deadlift and wall push.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we show that the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to manipulate dietary cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive desiccation by inducing biostasis. To survive drying tardigrades rely on intrinsically disordered CAHS proteins that form gels. However, the sequence features and mechanisms underlying gel formation and the necessity of gelation for protection have not been demonstrated. Here we report a mechanism of gelation for CAHS D similar to that of intermediate filaments. We show that gelation restricts molecular motion, immobilizing and protecting labile material from the harmful effects of drying. In vivo, we observe that CAHS D forms fiber-like condensates during osmotic stress. Condensation of CAHS D improves survival of osmotically shocked cells through at least two mechanisms: reduction of cell volume change and reduction of metabolic activity. Importantly, condensation of CAHS D is reversible and metabolic rates return to control levels after CAHS condensates are resolved. This work provides insights into how tardigrades induce biostasis through the self-assembly of CAHS gels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeTo identify the effects of leucine, {beta}-hydroxy {beta}-methylbutyrate (HMB) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) on post-exercise cytokine responses in females and males.

MethodsMales (n=53) and females (n=37) completed 100 drop jumps and consumed either no supplement, leucine (3g/d), HMB (3g/d) or BCAA (4.5g/d) from 1d pre to 14d post-exercise. Muscle soreness, squat jumps, chair rises and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at pre, post, 24h, 48h, 7 and 14d. Blood lactate (pre, post), 10 cytokines (pre, 24h, 48h, 7d) and oestradiol (pre, 7d) were also measured.

ResultsWithout supplementation post-exercise, soreness was induced in both males (6-fold) and females (5-fold). With supplementation, there were no increases in CK or oestradiol in females and no impact on muscle soreness, performance, or function in both sexes. In males, CK was elevated in untreated (48%) and leucine (69%) conditions vs baseline, but these were suppressed with HMB and BCAA. IL-7 was elevated in females vs males at baseline (6.3-fold), leucine increased IL-7 concentrations in females at 24h (17.0-fold), 48h (5.1-fold) vs males. With HMB, TNFr1- increased in females at 24h (2.2-fold), 48h (2.3-fold) and 7d (2.3-fold) vs males. In males with BCAA, TNFr1- decreased (P=0.06) from pre to 24h (6.8-fold), then increased (P&lt;0.05) from 24 to 48h (8.0-fold).

ConclusionAlthough supplements were without effect on soreness following exercise, the cytokine response was evoked by exercise and impacted significantly by leucine, HMB and BCAA in females vs males. This improved cytokine response in females could lead to improved resistance to damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Pathogenic variants in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias and progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. No effective medical therapy is available to prevent and/or arrest the disease. We tested the hypothesis that AAV-mediated delivery of the human PKP2 gene to an adult mammalian heart deficient in PKP2 can arrest disease progression and significantly prolong survival. Methods: Experiments were carried out using a cardiac-specific, tamoxifen (TAM)-activated PKP2 knockout murine model (PKP2-cKO). The potential therapeutic, AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601), is a recombinant AAVrh.74 gene therapy viral vector encoding the human PKP2 variant A (PKP2a). AAVrh.74-PKP2a was delivered to adult mice by a single tail vein injection either before or after TAM-activated PKP2-cKO. PKP2 expression was confirmed by molecular and histopathologic analyses. Cardiac function and disease progression were monitored by survival analyses, echocardiography and electrocardiography. Results: Consistent with prior findings, loss of PKP2 expression caused 100% mortality within 50 days after TAM injection. In contrast, AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated PKP2a expression resulted in 100% survival for more than 5 months (at study termination). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that AAVrh.74-PKP2a prevented right ventricle dilation, arrested left ventricle functional decline, and mitigated arrhythmia burden. Molecular and histological analysis showed AAVrh.74-PKP2a-mediated transgene mRNA and protein expression and appropriate PKP2 localization at the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Importantly, therapeutic benefit was shown in mice receiving AAVrh.74-PKP2a after disease onset. Conclusion: These preclinical data demonstrate the potential for AAVrh.74-PKP2a (RP-A601) as a therapeutic for PKP2-related ARVC in both early and more advanced stages of disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pharmacological administration of Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) alters food choice, including that it decreases the consumption of sucrose and other sweet tastants. Conversely, endogenous secretion of FGF21 by the liver is modulated by diet, such that plasma FGF21 is increased after eating foods that have a low dietary protein: total energy (P: E) ratio. Together, these findings suggest a strategy to promote healthy eating, in which the macronutrient content of a pre-load meal could reduce the later consumption of sweet desserts. Here, we tested the prediction that individuals eating a low P: E pre-load meal, and next offered a highly palatable sweet  dessert, would eat less of the sugary snack compared to controls, due to increased FGF21 signaling. In addition to decreasing sweet intake, FGF21 increases the consumption of dietary protein. Thus, we predicted that individuals eating a low protein pre-load meal, and subsequently offered a very high-protein pellet as  dessert or snack, would eat more of the high protein pellet compared to controls, and that this depends on FGF21. We tested this in C57Bl/6J, and liver-specific FGF21-null (FGF21{Delta}L) null male and female mice and littermate controls. Contrary to expectation, eating a low protein pre-load did not reduce the later consumption of a sweet solution in either males or females, despite robustly increasing plasma FGF21. Rather, eating the low protein pre-load increased later consumption of a high protein pellet. This was more apparent among males and was abrogated in the FGF21{Delta}L mice. We conclude that physiologic induction of hepatic FGF21 by a low protein pre-load is not sufficient to reduce later consumption of sweet dessert, though it effectively increases the subsequent intake of dietary protein in male mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their derivatives, the long and very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), are preferentially transported by the mother to the fetus. Failure to supply EFAs is strongly linked with stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, dietary supplementation during pregnancy is unable to simply reverse these outcomes, suggesting imperfectly understood interactions between dietary EFA intake and the molecular mechanisms of maternal supply. Here we combine untargeted lipidomics with transcriptional profiling of healthy and genetically-manipulated murine models to understand the maternal adaptations required to provide LC-PUFAs to the developing fetus. We discovered a late pregnancy-specific, selective activation of the Liver X Receptor signalling pathway which dramatically increases maternal supply of LC-PUFAs within circulating phospholipids. Crucially, genetic ablation of this pathway in the mother reduced LC-PUFA accumulation by the fetus. Overall our work suggests new molecular strategies for improving maternal-fetal transfer of these important lipids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Desert organisms have evolved physiological, biochemical, and genomic mechanisms to survive the extreme aridity of desert environments. Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements to characterize the response to water-deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 hours of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant weight loss likely related to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared to hydrated males while body temperature decreased for females without access to water compared to hydrated, suggesting daily torpor in females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retinal bipolar and amacrine cells receive visual information from photoreceptors and participate in the first steps of image processing in the retina. Several studies have suggested the operation of aerobic glycolysis and a lactate shuttle system in the retina due to the high production of this metabolite under aerobic conditions. However, whether bipolar cells form part of this metabolic circuit remains unclear. Here, we show that the lactate transporter MCT2 is functionally expressed in inner retinal neurons and demonstrate their ability to consume extracellular lactate as an alternative to glucose. In rod bipolar cells, lactate is used to maintain homeostasis of various ions and electrical responses. Overall, our data contribute to a better understanding of inner retinal metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The identification of bleaching tolerant traits among individual corals is a major focus for many restoration and conservation initiatives but often relies on large scale or high-throughput experimental manipulations which may not be accessible to many front-line restoration practitioners. Here we evaluate a machine learning technique to generate a predictive model which estimates bleaching severity using non-destructive chlorophyll-a fluorescence photophysiological metrics measured with a low-cost and open access bio-optical tool. First, a four-week long thermal bleaching experiment was performed on 156 genotypes of Acropora palmata at a land-based restoration facility. Resulting bleaching responses (percent change in Fv/Fm or Absorbance) significantly differed across the four distinct phenotypes generated via a photophysiology-based dendrogram, indicating strong concordance between fluorescence-based photophysiological metrics and future bleaching severity. Next, these correlations were used to train and then test a Random Forest algorithm-based model using a bootstrap resampling technique. Correlation between predicted and actual bleaching responses in test corals was significant (p &lt; 0.0001) and increased with the number of corals used in model training (Peak average R2 values of 0.42 and 0.33 for Fv/Fm and absorbance, respectively). Strong concordance between photophysiology-based phenotypes and future bleaching severity may provide a highly scalable means for assessing reef corals.</p>
