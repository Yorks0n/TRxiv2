The intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in homeostasis, both by facilitating absorption of nutrients and providing a tight shield to prevent the invasion by either pathogen or commensal microorganisms. Intestinal barrier malfunction is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to the dysregulation of other tissues such as the liver, fat, skeletal muscle, and brain.">

J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576063\nThe intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in homeostasis, both by facilitating absorption of nutrients and providing a tight shield to prevent the invasion by either pathogen or commensal microorganisms. Intestinal barrier malfunction is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to the dysregulation of other tissues such as the liver, fat, skeletal muscle, and brain. Hence, a deeper understanding of physiological aspects related to an enhanced barrier function is of great clinical relevance. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has many unusual biological features, including impaired colonic neuron sensitivity to acid and bradykinin, and resistance to chemically induced intestinal damage. However, insight into their intestinal barrier physiology is scarce. Here, we observed notable differences in intestinal tissue structure between naked mole-rats and mice, especially in the ileum. This was characterised by thicker muscularis and submucosa layers, longer villi and larger crypts. In measuring gut permeability, naked mole-rats showed reduced permeability compared to mice, especially in the small intestine (ileum). Furthermore, intestinal anion secretion induced by serotonin, bradykinin, histamine and capsaicin was significantly impaired in naked mole-rats compared to mice, despite the expression of receptors for all these agonists. Collectively, these findings indicate that naked mole-rats possess a robust gastrointestinal barrier, that is hard to penetrate and is resistant to environmental and endogenous irritants. Naked mole-rats may therefore provide valuable insights into the physiology of the intestinal barrier related to different pathological conditions and set the stage for the development of innovative and effective therapies.\nIdentification of novel and distinct FGF23 signaling in a Klotho-dependent and -independent manner\nAuthors: Kopper, K.; Pastor, J.; Moe, O. W.; Loffing, J.; Pathare, G.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576116\nFibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is crucial for phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Moreover, FGF23 levels are very high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with unclear functions. Binding of FGF23 to its coreceptor Klotho is considered essential for its actions. However, recent data suggested that CKD-related high FGF23 levels may have Klotho-independent cardiotoxic and inflammatory effects but the underlying signaling mechanisms are unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased transcriptomic profiling in HEK293 cells, comparing the effects of 0.5 nM FGF23 for 1 hour (low-transitory: [~]physiological) and 10 nM FGF23 for 24 hours (high-prolonged: [~]pathological), in the presence and absence of Klotho. We found that, at physiological concentration, FGF23 action requires Klotho and follows the canonical MAPK signaling. Conversely, at pathological high levels, FGF23 acts both in the presence and in the absence of Klotho. In the presence of Klotho, high FGF23 activates a plethora of transcripts including the inflammatory genes (e.g. TGFB1, GDF15, ANXA1 and TNFRSF9/12) known to be elevated in patients with CKD. Interestingly, in the absence of Klotho, high FGF23 levels does also regulate a small and unique set of genes related to post-transcriptional modifications and translation initiation. To conclude, Klotho is essential for FGF23 signaling at physiological FGF23 concentrations. However, with pathologically high FGF23 levels, Klotho acts as a molecular switch determining the type of FGF23 response.\nDietary methionine/choline deficiency affects behavioural and molecular circadian rhythms\nAuthors: Saer, B.; Taylor, G.; Hayes, A.; Ananthasubramaniam, B.; Fustin, J.-M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574014\nThe feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders. Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis. We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.\nCell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of arginase-II on cardiac aging\nAuthors: Potenza, D. M.; Cheng, X.; AJALBERT, G.; Brenna, A.; Giraud, M.-N.; FROBERT, A.; Cook, S.; Mertz, K. D.; Yang, Z.; Ming, X.-F.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576017\nAging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of arg-ii (arg-ii-/-) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1{beta} release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1{beta} from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.\nImpact of Capillary and Sarcolemmal Proximity on Mitochondrial Structure and Energetic Function in Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Parry, H. A.; Willingham, T. B.; Giordano, K. A.; Kim, Y.; Qazi, S.; Knutson, J. R.; Combs, C. A.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574684\nMitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.\nBone quality following peripubertal growth in a mouse model of transmasculine gender-affirming hormone therapy\nAuthors: Henry, B. W.; Dela Cruz, C.; Goulet, R. W.; Nolan, B. T.; Locke, C.; Padmanabhan, V.; Moravec, M. B.; Shikanov, A.; Killian, M. L.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570840\nDuring peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender and gender diverse youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender and gender diverse youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa + T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender and gender diverse youth.\nExtracellular RNA induce neutrophil recruitment via endothelial TLR3 during venous thrombosis after vascular injury\nAuthors: Najem, M. Y.; Rys, R. N.; Laurance, S.; Bertin, F.-R.; Gourdou-Latyszenok, V.; Gourhant, L.; Le Gall, L.; Le Corre, R.; Couturaud, F.; Blostein, M.; Lemarie, C. A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576322\nBackground: Venous thromboembolism is associated with endothelial cell activation that contributes to the inflammation-dependent activation of the coagulation system. Cellular damages are associated with the release of different species of extracellular RNA (eRNA) involved in inflammation and coagulation. TLR3, which recognizes (viral) double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and also self-RNA fragments might be the receptor of these eRNA during venous thromboembolism. We investigate how eRNA regulate endothelial function through TLR3 and contribute to venous thromboembolism. Methods and Results: Thrombus formation and size in WT and TLR3 deficient (-/-) mice were monitored by ultrasonography after venous thrombosis using the FeCl3 and stasis models. Mice were treated with RNase1, poly(I:C) or RNA extracted from murine endothelial cells (eRNA). Gene expression and signaling pathway activation were analyzed in HEK293T cells overexpressing TLR3 in response to eRNA or in HUVECs transfected with a siRNA against TLR3. Plasma clot formation on treated HUVECs was analyzed. Thrombosis exacerbated RNA release in vivo and increased RNA content within the thrombus. RNase1 treatment reduced thrombus size compared to vehicle-treated mice. Poly(I:C) and eRNA treatments increased thrombus size in WT mice, but not in TLR3-/- mice, by bolstering neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, TLR3 activation in endothelial cells promotes CXCL5 secretion and neutrophil recruitment in vitro. eRNA triggered plasma clot formation. eRNA mediate these effects through TLR3-dependent activation of NF{kappa}B. Conclusions: We show that eRNA and TLR3 activation enhance venous thromboembolism through neutrophil recruitment and secretion of CXCL5.\nLoss of calpain 3 dysregulates store-operated calcium entry and its exercise response in mice\nAuthors: Villani, K. R.; Zhong, R.; Henley-Beasley, C. S.; Rastelli, G.; Boncompagni, S.; Barton, E. R.; Wei-LaPierre, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575391\nLimb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene encoding Calpain 3, a skeletal-muscle specific, Ca2+-dependent protease. Localization of Calpain 3 within the triad suggests it contributes to Ca2+ homeostasis. Through live-cell Ca2+ measurements, muscle mechanics, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (EM) in Capn3 deficient (C3KO) and wildtype (WT) mice, we determined if loss of Calpain 3 altered Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) activity. Direct Ca2+ influx measurements revealed loss of Capn3 elicits elevated resting SOCE and increased resting cytosolic Ca2+, supported by high incidence of calcium entry units (CEUs) observed by EM. C3KO and WT mice were subjected to a single bout of treadmill running to elicit SOCE. Within 1HR post-treadmill running, C3KO mice exhibited diminished force production in extensor digitorum longus muscles and a greater decay of Ca2+ transients in flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers during repetitive stimulation. Striking evidence for impaired exercise-induced SOCE activation in C3KO mice included poor colocalization of key SOCE proteins, stromal-interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) and ORAI1, combined with disappearance of CEUs in C3KO muscles. These results demonstrate that Calpain 3 is a key regulator of SOCE in skeletal muscle and identify SOCE dysregulation as a contributing factor to LGMD2A pathology.\nTRPM8-dependent shaking in mammals and birds\nAuthors: Selescu, T.; Bivoleanu, R.-A.; Iodi Carstens, M.; Manolache, A.; Caragea, V.-M.; Hutanu, D.-E.; Meerupally, R.; Wei, E. T.; Carstens, E.; Zimmermann, K.; Babes, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573364\nRemoving water from wet fur or feathers is important for thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals. The \"wet dog shake\" (WDS) behavior has been largely characterized in mammals but to a much lesser extent in birds. Although it is known that TRPM8 is the main molecular transducer of low temperature in mammals, it is not clear if wetness-induced shaking in furred and feathered animals is dependent on TRPM8. Here, we show that a novel TRPM8 agonist induces WDS in rodents and, importantly, in birds, similar to the shaking behavior evoked by water-spraying. Furthermore, the WDS onset depends on TRPM8, as we show in water-sprayed mice. Overall, our results provide multiple evidence for a TRPM8 dependence of WDS behaviors in all tested species. These suggest that a convergent evolution selected similar shaking behaviors to expel water from fur and feathers, with TRPM8 being involved in wetness sensing in both mammals and birds.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in homeostasis, both by facilitating absorption of nutrients and providing a tight shield to prevent the invasion by either pathogen or commensal microorganisms. Intestinal barrier malfunction is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased insulin sensitivity, which may lead to the dysregulation of other tissues such as the liver, fat, skeletal muscle, and brain. Hence, a deeper understanding of physiological aspects related to an enhanced barrier function is of great clinical relevance. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has many unusual biological features, including impaired colonic neuron sensitivity to acid and bradykinin, and resistance to chemically induced intestinal damage. However, insight into their intestinal barrier physiology is scarce. Here, we observed notable differences in intestinal tissue structure between naked mole-rats and mice, especially in the ileum. This was characterised by thicker muscularis and submucosa layers, longer villi and larger crypts. In measuring gut permeability, naked mole-rats showed reduced permeability compared to mice, especially in the small intestine (ileum). Furthermore, intestinal anion secretion induced by serotonin, bradykinin, histamine and capsaicin was significantly impaired in naked mole-rats compared to mice, despite the expression of receptors for all these agonists. Collectively, these findings indicate that naked mole-rats possess a robust gastrointestinal barrier, that is hard to penetrate and is resistant to environmental and endogenous irritants. Naked mole-rats may therefore provide valuable insights into the physiology of the intestinal barrier related to different pathological conditions and set the stage for the development of innovative and effective therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is crucial for phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Moreover, FGF23 levels are very high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with unclear functions. Binding of FGF23 to its coreceptor Klotho is considered essential for its actions. However, recent data suggested that CKD-related high FGF23 levels may have Klotho-independent cardiotoxic and inflammatory effects but the underlying signaling mechanisms are unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased transcriptomic profiling in HEK293 cells, comparing the effects of 0.5 nM FGF23 for 1 hour (low-transitory: [~]physiological) and 10 nM FGF23 for 24 hours (high-prolonged: [~]pathological), in the presence and absence of Klotho. We found that, at physiological concentration, FGF23 action requires Klotho and follows the canonical MAPK signaling. Conversely, at pathological high levels, FGF23 acts both in the presence and in the absence of Klotho. In the presence of Klotho, high FGF23 activates a plethora of transcripts including the inflammatory genes (e.g. TGFB1, GDF15, ANXA1 and TNFRSF9/12) known to be elevated in patients with CKD. Interestingly, in the absence of Klotho, high FGF23 levels does also regulate a small and unique set of genes related to post-transcriptional modifications and translation initiation. To conclude, Klotho is essential for FGF23 signaling at physiological FGF23 concentrations. However, with pathologically high FGF23 levels, Klotho acts as a molecular switch determining the type of FGF23 response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders.

Dietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis.

We have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of arg-ii (arg-ii-/-) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1{beta} release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1{beta} from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During peri-puberty, bone growth and the attainment peak bone mass is driven predominantly by sex steroids. This is important when treating transgender and gender diverse youth, who have become increasingly present at pediatric clinics. Analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are commonly prescribed to transgender and gender diverse youth prior to starting gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). However, the impact of GnRH agonists on long bones with the addition of GAHT is relatively unknown. To explore this, we developed a trans-masculine model by introducing either GnRHa or vehicle treatment to female-born mice at a pre-pubertal age. This treatment was followed by male GAHT (testosterone, T) or control treatment three weeks later. Six weeks after T therapy, bone quality was compared between four treatment groups: Control (vehicle only), GnRHa-only, GnRHa &#43; T, and T-only. Bone length/size, bone shape, mechanical properties, and trabecular morphology were modulated by GAHT. Independent of GnRHa administration, mice treated with T had shorter femurs, larger trabecular volume and increased trabecular number, higher trabecular bone mineral density, and wider superstructures on the surface of bone (e.g., third trochanters) when compared to control or GnRHa-only mice. In conclusion, prolonged treatment of GnRHa with subsequent GAHT treatment directly affect the composition, parameters, and morphology of the developing long bone. These findings provide insight to help guide clinical approaches to care for transgender and gender diverse youth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Venous thromboembolism is associated with endothelial cell activation that contributes to the inflammation-dependent activation of the coagulation system. Cellular damages are associated with the release of different species of extracellular RNA (eRNA) involved in inflammation and coagulation. TLR3, which recognizes (viral) double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and also self-RNA fragments might be the receptor of these eRNA during venous thromboembolism. We investigate how eRNA regulate endothelial function through TLR3 and contribute to venous thromboembolism. Methods and Results: Thrombus formation and size in WT and TLR3 deficient (-/-) mice were monitored by ultrasonography after venous thrombosis using the FeCl3 and stasis models. Mice were treated with RNase1, poly(I:C) or RNA extracted from murine endothelial cells (eRNA). Gene expression and signaling pathway activation were analyzed in HEK293T cells overexpressing TLR3 in response to eRNA or in HUVECs transfected with a siRNA against TLR3. Plasma clot formation on treated HUVECs was analyzed. Thrombosis exacerbated RNA release in vivo and increased RNA content within the thrombus. RNase1 treatment reduced thrombus size compared to vehicle-treated mice. Poly(I:C) and eRNA treatments increased thrombus size in WT mice, but not in TLR3-/- mice, by bolstering neutrophil recruitment. Mechanistically, TLR3 activation in endothelial cells promotes CXCL5 secretion and neutrophil recruitment in vitro. eRNA triggered plasma clot formation. eRNA mediate these effects through TLR3-dependent activation of NF{kappa}B. Conclusions: We show that eRNA and TLR3 activation enhance venous thromboembolism through neutrophil recruitment and secretion of CXCL5.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene encoding Calpain 3, a skeletal-muscle specific, Ca2&#43;-dependent protease. Localization of Calpain 3 within the triad suggests it contributes to Ca2&#43; homeostasis. Through live-cell Ca2&#43; measurements, muscle mechanics, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (EM) in Capn3 deficient (C3KO) and wildtype (WT) mice, we determined if loss of Calpain 3 altered Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) activity. Direct Ca2&#43; influx measurements revealed loss of Capn3 elicits elevated resting SOCE and increased resting cytosolic Ca2&#43;, supported by high incidence of calcium entry units (CEUs) observed by EM. C3KO and WT mice were subjected to a single bout of treadmill running to elicit SOCE. Within 1HR post-treadmill running, C3KO mice exhibited diminished force production in extensor digitorum longus muscles and a greater decay of Ca2&#43; transients in flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers during repetitive stimulation. Striking evidence for impaired exercise-induced SOCE activation in C3KO mice included poor colocalization of key SOCE proteins, stromal-interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) and ORAI1, combined with disappearance of CEUs in C3KO muscles. These results demonstrate that Calpain 3 is a key regulator of SOCE in skeletal muscle and identify SOCE dysregulation as a contributing factor to LGMD2A pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Removing water from wet fur or feathers is important for thermoregulation in warm-blooded animals. The &#34;wet dog shake&#34; (WDS) behavior has been largely characterized in mammals but to a much lesser extent in birds. Although it is known that TRPM8 is the main molecular transducer of low temperature in mammals, it is not clear if wetness-induced shaking in furred and feathered animals is dependent on TRPM8. Here, we show that a novel TRPM8 agonist induces WDS in rodents and, importantly, in birds, similar to the shaking behavior evoked by water-spraying. Furthermore, the WDS onset depends on TRPM8, as we show in water-sprayed mice. Overall, our results provide multiple evidence for a TRPM8 dependence of WDS behaviors in all tested species. These suggest that a convergent evolution selected similar shaking behaviors to expel water from fur and feathers, with TRPM8 being involved in wetness sensing in both mammals and birds.</p>
