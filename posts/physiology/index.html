E.; Soeller, C.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550636\nThe cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2+ enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2+ sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2+ handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.\nDirect photoreception of a pituitary endocrine cell, melanotroph, induces a hormone release\nAuthors: Fukuda, A.; Sato, K.; Fujimori, C.; Yamashita, T.; Takeuchi, A.; Ohuchi, H.; Umatani, C.; Kanda, S.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551597\nIn addition to canonical photoreception by the eye, many other organs express non-visual photoreceptors although their biological significance is mostly unknown. Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2+]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection. One-Sentence SummaryAn endocrine cell of the pituitary was proven to be a photoreceptive cell that enables autonomous hormone release.\nThe Endosomal pH Regulator NHE6 is Required for Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake in Adipocytes\nAuthors: Mekile, A. X.; Makena, M. R.; Gupta, R.; White, C. J.; Bowman, R. W.; Patnayak, R. L.; Lorenzo, D. N.; Rao, R.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551163\nObjectiveTrafficking of GLUcose Transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from the adipocyte vesicular pool to the cell surface is tightly regulated by insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to changing demands in energy consumption. Previously, endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6, gene name SLC9A6) was identified in adipocyte plasma membranes and shown to associate with GLUT4-positive vesicles. However, the functional contribution of NHE6 to GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake remained uncharacterized. MethodsNHE6 was knocked down in 3T3L1 cells either before or after differentiation into adipocytes using lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose into adipocytes was quantified in response to insulin. We used epitope tagged constructs to distinguish between localization of vesicular and surface levels of NHE6 and GLUT4 proteins. Protein and transcript levels of components of the glucose signaling pathway were monitored by qPCR and Western analysis, respectively, in response to NHE6 knockdown and/or treatment with chemical modulators of endosomal pH. ResultsWe show that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes is severely impaired upon NHE6 depletion. Correspondingly, insulin-stimulated surface expression of GLUT4 at the adipocyte plasma membrane was diminished in NHE6 knockdown cells due to a post-transcriptional decrease in basal GLUT4. Metformin response of GLUT4 was also muted in the absence of NHE6. Further, we demonstrate diminished activation of the GLUT4 translocation pathway in the absence of NHE6 via reduced expression of the insulin receptor and reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Akt. Components of GLUT4 storage vesicles, including GLUT4, LRP1 and sortilin were downregulated in NHE6-knockdown adipocytes under basal conditions. Proteostatic control of key components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptor, GLUT4) could be restored by chemical bypass of NHE6 using the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or the Na+/H+ exchanger mimetic monensin. ConclusionsThus, NHE6 is critical for proper expression and trafficking of GLUT4. Basal expression of both insulin receptor and GLUT4 in NHE6 knockdown cells could be restored by bafilomycin-inhibition of the H+-ATPase or the H+ ionophore monensin pointing to pH dysregulation as the underlying defect. We suggest that NHE6 is a component of GLUT4 storage vesicles where it regulates proteostasis. These findings establish NHE6 as a novel contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism with implications for Christianson syndrome patients who carry loss of function mutations in the SLC9A6 gene.

I.; Belly, H. D.; Wang, B. K.; Wong, A.; Kim, M.; Oh, F.; DeGeorge, J.; Huang, X.; Guang, S.; Weiner, O. K.; Ma, D. K.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550452\nEarly-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.\nThe black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis detects CO2 without the Haller's organ\nAuthors: Städele, C.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551779\nBoth male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animals state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Hallers organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Hallers organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.\nAblation of carotid body activity reverses diabesity by improving white and brown adipose tissue sympathetic innervation and metabolism\nAuthors: Melo, B.

V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552063\nFinding novel pathological mechanisms that lead to innovative strategies to treat obesity and its associated illness are critically needed. The carotid bodies (CB) are metabolic sensors whose dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance development. Herein, we find that the ablation of CB activity, through resection of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) promotes weight loss and restores metabolic function in high fat (HF) rodents, by increasing WAT basal metabolism and by restoring WAT and BAT sympathetic activation. Moreover, we found that CSN resection rescues adipose tissue sympathetic/catecholamine resistance present in obesity states. Additionally, we found that the CB signals integrated in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are decreased in obesity states and that CSN denervation in HF animals restore neuronal activity in this region. By inducing energy expenditure via the increase in WAT and BAT metabolism, CB modulation might be used as a therapeutic target for obesity and dysmetabolism.

M.; McQuillan, T. E.; Frick, J. M.; Minchella, P. M.; Levasseur, B. M.; Tinoco, O.; Birmingham, L.; Lewis, A. E.; Thyfault, J. P.; Christianson, J. A.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549724\nEarly life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.\nPathogenic entero- and salivatypes harbour changes in microbiome virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes with increasing chronic liver disease severity\nAuthors: Lee, S.; Arefaine, B.; Begum, N.; Stamouli, M.; Witherden, E.; Mohamad, M.; Harzandi, A.; Zamalloa, A.; Cai, H.; Edwards, L. A.; Williams, R.; Chokshi, S.; Mardinoglu, A.; Proctor, G.; Shawcross, D. L.; Moyes, D.; Uhlen, M.; Shoaie, S.; Patel, V. C.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552152\nBackground \u0026 Aims: Life-threatening complications of cirrhosis are triggered by bacterial infections, with the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Alterations in the gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are recognised to influence clinical outcomes, whilst the role of the oral microbiome is still being explored. Our aims were to simultaneously interrogate the gut and oral micro- and mycobiome in cirrhotic patients, and assess microbial community structure overlap in relation to clinical outcomes, as well as alterations in virulence factors and AMR genes. Methods: 18 healthy controls (HC), 20 stable cirrhotics (SC), 50 DC, 18 ACLF and 15 with non-liver sepsis (NLS) i.e. severe infection but without cirrhosis, were recruited at a tertiary liver centre. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was undertaken from saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples (paired where possible). Salivatypes and enterotypes based on clustering of genera were calculated and compared in relation to cirrhosis severity and in relation to specific clinical parameters. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated in both oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified. Results: Specific saliva- and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity, and in those with hyperammonemia. Overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed and was significantly higher in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant use. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other virulence factors in patients with DC and ACLF. Substantial numbers of ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected with 575 ARGs common to both sites. The cirrhosis resistome was significantly different to HCs, with three and four resistotypes identified for the oral and gut microbiome, respectively. Discussion: Oral and gut microbiome profiles differ significantly with increasing severity of cirrhosis, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. DC and ACLF have significantly worse microbial diversity than NLS, despite similar antimicrobial exposure, supporting the additive patho-biological effect of cirrhosis. The degree of microbial community overlap between sites, frequency of virulence factors and presence of ARGs, all increment significantly with hepatic decompensation. These alterations may predispose to higher infection risk, poorer response to antimicrobial therapy and worsening outcomes, and provide the rationale for developing non-antibiotic-dependent microbiome-modulating therapies.\nCentral and peripheral clocks synergistically enhance circadian robustness, flexibility and performance of cardiac pacemaking\nAuthors: Li, P.; Kim, J. K.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552251\nThe strong circadian (~24h) rhythms in heart rate (HR) are critical for flexible regulation of cardiac pacemaking function throughout the day. While this circadian flexibility in HR is robustly sustained in diverse conditions, it declines as the heart ages, accompanied by reduced maximal HR performance. The intricate regulation of circadian HR patterns involves the orchestration of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities (SNA and PNA) alongside local circadian rhythmicity (LCR) within the heart. However, their intricate interactions that sustain the resilience and adaptability of circadian rhythms, as well as the mechanisms that underpin their deterioration during the aging process, remain enigmatic. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model describing autonomic control and LCR in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) that accurately captures distinct circadian patterns in adult and aged mice. Our model underscores the indispensable synergy among SNA, PNA, and LCR in preserving circadian flexibility, robustness, and performance in SANC. SNA predominantly enhances SANC robustness and performance, while PNA primarily drives SANC flexibility, complemented by LCR and SNA. LCR acts as a booster, further enhancing SANC flexibility and performance. However, the delicate balance of this synergy is disrupted with age, resulting in diminished SANC performance and flexibility. Specifically, age-related impairment of PNA selectively dampens SANC flexibility while ion channel remodeling disrupts all SANC functions. Our work shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction, which may help to identify potential therapeutic targets within the circadian clock for the prevention and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\nThe Calcium-sensing receptor is an important regulator of female visceral and perivascular adipocyte function.\nAuthors: Higgins, E.; Gonzalez-Galofre, Z.; McAbney, J.; Leiper, J. M.; Dowsett, L. B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551589\nThe Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by fluctuations in extracellular calcium concentrations. Its importance in calcium homeostasis has long been established, though its role in other tissues is not well understood. Obesity is a major epidemic with both clinical and social consequences, therefore, understanding the full function and regulation of adipocytes is of critical importance. Adipocyte CaSR has previously been linked to lipolysis and inflammation in vitro. In this study, we set out to further our understanding of adipocyte CaSR in vivo via the generation of an adipocyte specific CaSR knockout mouse (CaSRAd-/-). We found female CaSRAd-/- mice weighed less than wildtype littermates with a significant reduction in visceral adipocyte size potentially due to increased expression of brown fat markers UCP-1 and Cidea. We also established that CaSR is expressed in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and that its deletion protects female mice from PVAT driven hypercontractility. In contrast CaSR deletion had no effect on male body mass, adipocyte size or vascular reactivity. In conclusion, CaSR seems to be of importance in female but not male visceral and perivascular adipose tissue.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2&#43; enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2&#43; sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2&#43; handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In addition to canonical photoreception by the eye, many other organs express non-visual photoreceptors although their biological significance is mostly unknown. Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2&#43; imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2&#43;]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection.

One-Sentence SummaryAn endocrine cell of the pituitary was proven to be a photoreceptive cell that enables autonomous hormone release.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTrafficking of GLUcose Transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from the adipocyte vesicular pool to the cell surface is tightly regulated by insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to changing demands in energy consumption. Previously, endosomal Na&#43;/H&#43; exchanger 6 (NHE6, gene name SLC9A6) was identified in adipocyte plasma membranes and shown to associate with GLUT4-positive vesicles. However, the functional contribution of NHE6 to GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake remained uncharacterized.

MethodsNHE6 was knocked down in 3T3L1 cells either before or after differentiation into adipocytes using lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose into adipocytes was quantified in response to insulin. We used epitope tagged constructs to distinguish between localization of vesicular and surface levels of NHE6 and GLUT4 proteins. Protein and transcript levels of components of the glucose signaling pathway were monitored by qPCR and Western analysis, respectively, in response to NHE6 knockdown and/or treatment with chemical modulators of endosomal pH.

ResultsWe show that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes is severely impaired upon NHE6 depletion. Correspondingly, insulin-stimulated surface expression of GLUT4 at the adipocyte plasma membrane was diminished in NHE6 knockdown cells due to a post-transcriptional decrease in basal GLUT4. Metformin response of GLUT4 was also muted in the absence of NHE6. Further, we demonstrate diminished activation of the GLUT4 translocation pathway in the absence of NHE6 via reduced expression of the insulin receptor and reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Akt. Components of GLUT4 storage vesicles, including GLUT4, LRP1 and sortilin were downregulated in NHE6-knockdown adipocytes under basal conditions. Proteostatic control of key components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptor, GLUT4) could be restored by chemical bypass of NHE6 using the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or the Na&#43;/H&#43; exchanger mimetic monensin.

ConclusionsThus, NHE6 is critical for proper expression and trafficking of GLUT4. Basal expression of both insulin receptor and GLUT4 in NHE6 knockdown cells could be restored by bafilomycin-inhibition of the H&#43;-ATPase or the H&#43; ionophore monensin pointing to pH dysregulation as the underlying defect. We suggest that NHE6 is a component of GLUT4 storage vesicles where it regulates proteostasis. These findings establish NHE6 as a novel contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism with implications for Christianson syndrome patients who carry loss of function mutations in the SLC9A6 gene.

        <p class="abstract">Early-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Both male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animals state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Hallers organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Hallers organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Finding novel pathological mechanisms that lead to innovative strategies to treat obesity and its associated illness are critically needed. The carotid bodies (CB) are metabolic sensors whose dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance development. Herein, we find that the ablation of CB activity, through resection of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) promotes weight loss and restores metabolic function in high fat (HF) rodents, by increasing WAT basal metabolism and by restoring WAT and BAT sympathetic activation. Moreover, we found that CSN resection rescues adipose tissue sympathetic/catecholamine resistance present in obesity states. Additionally, we found that the CB signals integrated in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are decreased in obesity states and that CSN denervation in HF animals restore neuronal activity in this region. By inducing energy expenditure via the increase in WAT and BAT metabolism, CB modulation might be used as a therapeutic target for obesity and dysmetabolism.

        <p class="abstract">Early life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; Aims: Life-threatening complications of cirrhosis are triggered by bacterial infections, with the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Alterations in the gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are recognised to influence clinical outcomes, whilst the role of the oral microbiome is still being explored. Our aims were to simultaneously interrogate the gut and oral micro- and mycobiome in cirrhotic patients, and assess microbial community structure overlap in relation to clinical outcomes, as well as alterations in virulence factors and AMR genes. Methods: 18 healthy controls (HC), 20 stable cirrhotics (SC), 50 DC, 18 ACLF and 15 with non-liver sepsis (NLS) i.e. severe infection but without cirrhosis, were recruited at a tertiary liver centre. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was undertaken from saliva (S) and faecal (F) samples (paired where possible). Salivatypes and enterotypes based on clustering of genera were calculated and compared in relation to cirrhosis severity and in relation to specific clinical parameters. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated in both oral and gut niches, and distinct resistotypes identified. Results: Specific saliva- and enterotypes revealed a greater proportion of pathobionts with concomitant reduction in autochthonous genera with increasing cirrhosis severity, and in those with hyperammonemia. Overlap between oral and gut microbiome communities was observed and was significantly higher in DC and ACLF vs SC and HCs, independent of antimicrobial, beta-blocker and acid suppressant use. Two distinct gut microbiome clusters [ENT2/ENT3] harboured genes encoding for the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) system and other virulence factors in patients with DC and ACLF. Substantial numbers of ARGs (oral: 1,218 and gut: 672) were detected with 575 ARGs common to both sites. The cirrhosis resistome was significantly different to HCs, with three and four resistotypes identified for the oral and gut microbiome, respectively. Discussion: Oral and gut microbiome profiles differ significantly with increasing severity of cirrhosis, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. DC and ACLF have significantly worse microbial diversity than NLS, despite similar antimicrobial exposure, supporting the additive patho-biological effect of cirrhosis. The degree of microbial community overlap between sites, frequency of virulence factors and presence of ARGs, all increment significantly with hepatic decompensation. These alterations may predispose to higher infection risk, poorer response to antimicrobial therapy and worsening outcomes, and provide the rationale for developing non-antibiotic-dependent microbiome-modulating therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The strong circadian (~24h) rhythms in heart rate (HR) are critical for flexible regulation of cardiac pacemaking function throughout the day. While this circadian flexibility in HR is robustly sustained in diverse conditions, it declines as the heart ages, accompanied by reduced maximal HR performance. The intricate regulation of circadian HR patterns involves the orchestration of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities (SNA and PNA) alongside local circadian rhythmicity (LCR) within the heart. However, their intricate interactions that sustain the resilience and adaptability of circadian rhythms, as well as the mechanisms that underpin their deterioration during the aging process, remain enigmatic. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model describing autonomic control and LCR in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) that accurately captures distinct circadian patterns in adult and aged mice. Our model underscores the indispensable synergy among SNA, PNA, and LCR in preserving circadian flexibility, robustness, and performance in SANC. SNA predominantly enhances SANC robustness and performance, while PNA primarily drives SANC flexibility, complemented by LCR and SNA. LCR acts as a booster, further enhancing SANC flexibility and performance. However, the delicate balance of this synergy is disrupted with age, resulting in diminished SANC performance and flexibility. Specifically, age-related impairment of PNA selectively dampens SANC flexibility while ion channel remodeling disrupts all SANC functions. Our work shed light on their critical synergistic interactions in regulating time-of-day cardiac pacemaking function and dysfunction, which may help to identify potential therapeutic targets within the circadian clock for the prevention and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by fluctuations in extracellular calcium concentrations. Its importance in calcium homeostasis has long been established, though its role in other tissues is not well understood. Obesity is a major epidemic with both clinical and social consequences, therefore, understanding the full function and regulation of adipocytes is of critical importance. Adipocyte CaSR has previously been linked to lipolysis and inflammation in vitro. In this study, we set out to further our understanding of adipocyte CaSR in vivo via the generation of an adipocyte specific CaSR knockout mouse (CaSRAd-/-). We found female CaSRAd-/- mice weighed less than wildtype littermates with a significant reduction in visceral adipocyte size potentially due to increased expression of brown fat markers UCP-1 and Cidea. We also established that CaSR is expressed in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and that its deletion protects female mice from PVAT driven hypercontractility. In contrast CaSR deletion had no effect on male body mass, adipocyte size or vascular reactivity. In conclusion, CaSR seems to be of importance in female but not male visceral and perivascular adipose tissue.</p>
