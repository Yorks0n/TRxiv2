J.\nScore: 36.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.23.512956\nAnalyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.\nInsulin at the Intersection of Thermoregulation and Glucose Homeostasis\nAuthors: Winn, N. C.; Schleh, M. W.; Garcia, J. N.; Lantier, L.; McGuinness, O. P.; Blair, J. A.; Hasty, A. H.; Wasserman, D. H.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.566254\nMammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (\u003c12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action, insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis. HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice. C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis. C_LIO_LIBrown fat glucose uptake sensitively increases with RT and decreases with TN by an insulin-independent mechanism.

E.; Gronset, M. N.; Zhang, C.; Iwamoto, H.; Hessel, A. L.; Kuehn, M. N.; Merino, C.; Amigo, N.; Frobert, O.; Giroud, S.; Staples, J. F.; Goropashnaya, A. V.; Fedorov, V. B.; Barnes, B. M.; Toien, O.; Drew, K. L.; Sprenger, R. J.; Ochala, J.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.566992\nHibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20{degrees}C). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8{degrees}C (near the body temperature of torpid animals), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.\nQuantification of healthspan in aging mice: Introducing FAMY and GRAIL\nAuthors: Lamming, D. W.\nScore: 26.0, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566044\nThe population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.\nThe entropic heart: Tracking the psychedelic state via heart rate dynamics\nAuthors: Rosas, F.

This work investigates the potential for autonomic markers to track the effects of psychedelics -- potent psychoactive drugs with important scientific and clinical value. For this purpose, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to estimate the entropy of heart rate dynamics under psychedelics. We also calculate Bayesian estimates of mean heart rate and heart rate variability, and investigate how these measures relate to subjective reports and neural effects. Results on datasets covering four drugs -- lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and sub-anaesthetic doses of the dissociative agent ketamine -- show consistent increases in mean heart rate, high-frequency heart rate variability, and heart rate entropy during the psychedelic experience. Moreover, these effects have predictive power over various dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Changes in heart rate entropy were found to be correlated with increases in brain entropy, while other autonomic markers were not. Overall, our results show that a cost-efficient autonomic measure has the potential to reveal surprising detail about subjective and brain states, opening up a range of new research avenues to explore in both basic and clinical neuroscience.\nCombined Right Ventricular Preload and Afterload Challenge Induces Contractile Dysfunction and Ventricular Arrhythmia in an Age-dependent Manner in Isolated Hearts of Dystrophin-deficient Mice\nAuthors: Behrmann, A. J.; Cayton, J.; Hayden, M.; Lambert, M.; Nourian, Z.; Nyanyo, K.; Hanft, L.; Krenz, M.; McDonald, K.; Domeier, T. L.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.564005\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive myopathy due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. Diaphragmatic weakness in DMD causes restrictive lung disease and excessive afterload on the right ventricle (RV). Thus, RV dysfunction in DMD develops early in disease progression. Herein, we deliver a 30-minute sustained RV preload and afterload challenge to isolated hearts of wildtype (Wt) and dystrophic (mdx4CV) mice at both young (2-6 month) and middle-age (8-12 month). Young dystrophic hearts exhibited greater pressure development than wildtype under unloaded conditions but following RV preload/afterload challenge exhibited similar contractile function as wildtype. Following RV preload/afterload challenge, young dystrophic hearts had an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared to wildtype. Hearts of middle-aged wildtype and dystrophic mice had similar contractile function during unloaded conditions, yet, after RV preload/afterload challenge, hearts of middle-aged dystrophic mice had severe RV contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmogenesis, including ventricular tachycardia. Following load challenge, young and middle-aged dystrophic hearts had greater damage, measured via tissue LDH release, than wildtype mice of similar age. Our data indicate complex age-dependent changes in RV function and arrhythmogenesis with load in dystrophin deficiency, highlighting the need to avoid sustained RV load to forestall RV dysfunction and arrhythmia.\nBreastfeeding enhances intestinal gluconeogenesis in infants\nAuthors: Ni, D.; Tan, J.; Macia, L.; Nanan, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566732\nObjectivesBreastfeeding confers metabolic benefits to the infants, including reducing risks for metabolic syndromes such as obesity and diabetes later in life, but the underlying mechanisms is not yet fully understood. Hence, we aim to investigate the impacts of breastfeeding on the metabolic organs of infants. MethodsPrevious literatures directly studying the influences of breastfeeding on offsprings metabolic organs were comprehensively reviewed. A microarray dataset of intestinal gene expression comparing infants fed on breastmilk versus formula milk was reanalyzed. ResultsReanalysis of microarray data showed that breastfeeding significantly enhanced gluconeogenesis in infants intestine. This resembled observations in other mammalian species where breastfeeding also promoted gluconeogenesis. ConclusionsBreastfeeding enhances intestinal gluconeogenesis in infants, which may underlie its metabolic advantages through finetuning the metabolic homeostasis. Such effect seems to be conserved across species, hinting its biological significance.\nPhysiology of the Weight Loss Plateau after Calorie Restriction, GLP-1 Receptor Agonism, and Bariatric Surgery\nAuthors: Hall, K. D.\nScore: 51.2, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565699\nObjectiveTo investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus. MethodsA validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite. ResultsRYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau. ConclusionsThese preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.\nHigh-resolution glucose tracing and in situ imaging reveals regulated lactate production in human pancreatic β cells\nAuthors: Cuozzo, F.; Viloria, K.; Shilleh, A.

A.; Ludwig, C.; Hodson, D. J.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.21.521364\nUsing 13C6 glucose labeling coupled to GC-MS and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we have obtained a comparative high-resolution map of glucose fate underpinning {beta} cell function. In both mouse and human islets, the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle is similar. Pyruvate-fueling of the TCA cycle is primarily mediated by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, with lower flux through pyruvate carboxylase. While conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in islets of both species, lactate accumulation is six-fold higher in human islets. Human islets express LDH, with low-moderate LDHA expression and {beta} cell-specific LDHB expression. LDHB inhibition increases glucose-dependent lactate generation in mouse and human {beta} cells, and decreases Ca2+-spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP levels. Thus, we show that LDHB limits glucose-stimulated lactate generation in {beta} cells. Further studies are warranted to understand how lactate impacts {beta} cell metabolism and/or function. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman and rodent islets generate lactate following glucose stimulation. C_LIO_LI{beta} cells specifically express LDHB, which acts to limit lactate generation. C_LIO_LILDHB inhibition influences Ca2+ spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP ratio. C_LI eTOCCuozzo et al show that glucose-stimulated rodent and human islets generate lactate. Transcriptomic and imaging analyses reveal that LDHB is specifically expressed in {beta} cells and unexpectedly restrains lactate production. LDHB expression and thus regulated lactate generation might reflect a key mechanism underlying {beta} cell metabolism, function and survival.\nFish Playpens: Method for raising individual juvenile zebrafish on a recirculating system for studies requiring repeated measures\nAuthors: Moll, T. O. C.; Farber, S. A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567840\nEven though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Analyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (&lt;12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action,  insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis.

HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room  laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice.
C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis.
C_LIO_LIBrown fat glucose uptake sensitively increases with RT and decreases with TN by an insulin-independent mechanism.

        <p class="abstract">Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20{degrees}C). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8{degrees}C (near the body temperature of torpid animals), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A growing body of work shows that autonomic signals provide a privileged evidence-stream to capture various aspects of subjective and neural states. This work investigates the potential for autonomic markers to track the effects of psychedelics -- potent psychoactive drugs with important scientific and clinical value. For this purpose, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to estimate the entropy of heart rate dynamics under psychedelics. We also calculate Bayesian estimates of mean heart rate and heart rate variability, and investigate how these measures relate to subjective reports and neural effects. Results on datasets covering four drugs -- lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and sub-anaesthetic doses of the dissociative agent ketamine -- show consistent increases in mean heart rate, high-frequency heart rate variability, and heart rate entropy during the psychedelic experience. Moreover, these effects have predictive power over various dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Changes in heart rate entropy were found to be correlated with increases in brain entropy, while other autonomic markers were not. Overall, our results show that a cost-efficient autonomic measure has the potential to reveal surprising detail about subjective and brain states, opening up a range of new research avenues to explore in both basic and clinical neuroscience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive myopathy due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. Diaphragmatic weakness in DMD causes restrictive lung disease and excessive afterload on the right ventricle (RV). Thus, RV dysfunction in DMD develops early in disease progression. Herein, we deliver a 30-minute sustained RV preload and afterload challenge to isolated hearts of wildtype (Wt) and dystrophic (mdx4CV) mice at both young (2-6 month) and middle-age (8-12 month). Young dystrophic hearts exhibited greater pressure development than wildtype under unloaded conditions but following RV preload/afterload challenge exhibited similar contractile function as wildtype. Following RV preload/afterload challenge, young dystrophic hearts had an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared to wildtype. Hearts of middle-aged wildtype and dystrophic mice had similar contractile function during unloaded conditions, yet, after RV preload/afterload challenge, hearts of middle-aged dystrophic mice had severe RV contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmogenesis, including ventricular tachycardia. Following load challenge, young and middle-aged dystrophic hearts had greater damage, measured via tissue LDH release, than wildtype mice of similar age. Our data indicate complex age-dependent changes in RV function and arrhythmogenesis with load in dystrophin deficiency, highlighting the need to avoid sustained RV load to forestall RV dysfunction and arrhythmia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesBreastfeeding confers metabolic benefits to the infants, including reducing risks for metabolic syndromes such as obesity and diabetes later in life, but the underlying mechanisms is not yet fully understood. Hence, we aim to investigate the impacts of breastfeeding on the metabolic organs of infants.

MethodsPrevious literatures directly studying the influences of breastfeeding on offsprings metabolic organs were comprehensively reviewed. A microarray dataset of intestinal gene expression comparing infants fed on breastmilk versus formula milk was reanalyzed.

ResultsReanalysis of microarray data showed that breastfeeding significantly enhanced gluconeogenesis in infants intestine. This resembled observations in other mammalian species where breastfeeding also promoted gluconeogenesis.

ConclusionsBreastfeeding enhances intestinal gluconeogenesis in infants, which may underlie its metabolic advantages through finetuning the metabolic homeostasis. Such effect seems to be conserved across species, hinting its biological significance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus.

MethodsA validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite.

ResultsRYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau.

ConclusionsThese preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Using 13C6 glucose labeling coupled to GC-MS and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we have obtained a comparative high-resolution map of glucose fate underpinning {beta} cell function. In both mouse and human islets, the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle is similar. Pyruvate-fueling of the TCA cycle is primarily mediated by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, with lower flux through pyruvate carboxylase. While conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in islets of both species, lactate accumulation is six-fold higher in human islets. Human islets express LDH, with low-moderate LDHA expression and {beta} cell-specific LDHB expression. LDHB inhibition increases glucose-dependent lactate generation in mouse and human {beta} cells, and decreases Ca2&#43;-spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP levels. Thus, we show that LDHB limits glucose-stimulated lactate generation in {beta} cells. Further studies are warranted to understand how lactate impacts {beta} cell metabolism and/or function.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman and rodent islets generate lactate following glucose stimulation.
C_LIO_LI{beta} cells specifically express LDHB, which acts to limit lactate generation.
C_LIO_LILDHB inhibition influences Ca2&#43; spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP ratio.

eTOCCuozzo et al show that glucose-stimulated rodent and human islets generate lactate. Transcriptomic and imaging analyses reveal that LDHB is specifically expressed in {beta} cells and unexpectedly restrains lactate production. LDHB expression and thus regulated lactate generation might reflect a key mechanism underlying {beta} cell metabolism, function and survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Even though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.</p>
