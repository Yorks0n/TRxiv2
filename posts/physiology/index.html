K.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554618\nElephant trunks have folds and wrinkles, but we don't know how wrinkles differ between elephant species and how trunks and their wrinkles develop. Adult Asian elephants have significantly more dorsal major trunk wrinkles (~126 +/- 25 SD) than African elephants (~83 +/- 13 SD). There are more dorsal than ventral major trunk wrinkles and there is a closer wrinkle spacing distally than proximally. Wrinkle numbers differed slightly as a function of trunk-lateralization. MicroCT-imaging revealed a relatively constant thickness of the outer elephant trunk skin, whereas the inner skin parts are thicker between folds than in folds. The trunk shows the greatest fetal length growth of elephant body parts. Trunk wrinkles are added in an early exponential phase, where wrinkles double every 20 days, and a later phase, where wrinkles are added slowly and at a faster rate in Asian compared to African elephants. We suggest wrinkles improve the ability of trunk skin to bend.\nContributions of individual satellite cells to muscle regeneration assessed using a confetti mouse model\nAuthors: Heemskerk, H.; Jagannathan, N. S.; Nasir, N. J. M.; Nguyen, B. P.; Sacadevan, K.; Matsudaira, P.; So, P. T.; Tucker-Kellogg, L.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554761\nInsufficient regeneration is implicated in muscle pathologies, but much remains unknown about the regenerative output of individual muscle stem cells, called satellite cells (SCs). Prior work showed that individual SCs contribute to regeneration of more than one muscle fiber (\"fiber-crossing\") after full-muscle damage. We investigated whether fiber-crossing also occurred in different regions of a localized muscle injury. To assess fiber-crossing with a minimum number of mice, we used lineage tracing with confetti fluorescence, and developed a novel stochastic modeling method to interpret the ambiguity of multi-color fluorescent lineage tags. Microscopy of the regenerated muscle showed that adjacent fibers often expressed the same colored tags. Computational analysis concluded that the observed color patches would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance unless SCs contributed myonuclei to multiple adjacent fibers (26-33% of SCs contributing to at most 1-2 additional fibers). Interestingly, these results were similar across the different regions studied, suggesting that severe destruction is not required for fiber-crossing. Our method to assess fiber-crossing may be useful for future study of gene and cell therapies that use fiber-crossing to aid muscle regeneration.\nA thrombus is formed by a gradient of platelet activation and procoagulant endothelium\nAuthors: CARMINITA, E.; TOURN, J.; CRESCENCE, L.; BROUILLY, N.; MERRILL-SKOLOFF, G.; MAZHARIAN, A.; DUBOIS, C.; Panicot-Dubois, L.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.550692\nIntroductionThe contribution of platelets in thrombosis within microcirculation has been extensively documented in the literature. We previously showed, in vivo, that platelet activation revealed by intracellular calcium mobilization was a crucial step in the growth of thrombi following laser-induced injury, a model of thromboinflammation. AimWe employed a multimodal, correlative microscopy approach and computational biology to investigate the extent of platelet activation and the spatial distribution of platelets throughout a growing thrombus. ResultsWe observed a reversible intracellular platelet calcium mobilization that correlates with the time a platelet resides during thrombus growth. Our bioinformatics analysis displayed three distinct platelet subpopulations resident within a thrombus: (1) resting, (2) partially activated, and (3) \"fully\" activated platelets. The spatial distribution of the platelet subpopulations in the thrombus creates a double gradient in both the transversal and longitudinal axis, with the maximal percentage of fully activated platelets close to the site of injury. However, these activated platelets did not express negative phospholipids. The injured endothelium was identified to play a vital role in activating the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thrombosis. ConclusionFollowing a laser-induced injury, thrombi are formed by a gradient of activated platelets from the injury site to the periphery of the thrombus. These different activation states of platelets throughout the thrombi regulate the biomechanics of the thrombus. The injured endothelium, rather than platelets, was identified to play a key role in the activation of the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thromboinflammation. EssentialsO_LIComputational biology was used to analyze thrombosis. C_LIO_LINon-activated, low- and fully-activated platelets are part of a thrombus.

D.; Pugh, J. N.; Close, G. L.; Kalakoutis, M.; Lazarus, N. R.; Harridge, S. R.; Ochala, J.; Stroud, M. J.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.551292\nMyonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (um2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P \u003c 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes.\nA neuronal circuit driven by GLP-1 in the olfactory bulb regulates insulin secretion\nAuthors: Montaner, M.; Denom, J.; Simon, V.; Jiang, W.; Holt, M.

M.; Migrenne-Li, S.; Trapp, S.; Gurden, H.; Magnan, C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555086\nGlucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.\nThe H3K27 acetyltransferase p300 is dispensable for thermogenic adipose tissue formation and function.\nAuthors: Gamu, D.; Cameron, M. S.; Gibson, W.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554499\nBrown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized for thermogenesis because it contains uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. BAT is also an endocrine organ, producing many signalling molecules important for regulating the metabolism of peripheral organs. Mounting evidence suggest that histone modifying enzymes are integral for the development, tissue maintenance, and postnatal functioning of brown and beige adipocytes. p300 and its functional homologue CREB-binding protein (CBP) are histone acetyltransferases that form the transcriptionally activating histone 3 acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac) mark. Using Ucp1-Cre, we examined the requirement of p300 activity specifically within thermogenic adipocytes. We hypothesized that loss of p300 activity would impair gene programming integral for BAT development/function, rendering knockouts susceptible to metabolic dysfunction and unable to form beige adipocytes. Despite successful knockdown, brown fat was completely unaffected by p300 deletion. As such, knockout mice showed a comparable metabolic profile to littermate controls in response to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, de novo beige adipogenesis within subcutaneous fat by a {beta}3 adrenergic agonist remained intact in knockout mice. Although p300 and CBP have non-overlapping roles in other tissues, our results indicate p300 HAT activity is dispensable within thermogenic fats, likely due to functional compensation by CBP.\nAuxin Exposure Disrupts Feeding Behavior and Fatty Acid Metabolism in Adult Drosophila\nAuthors: Fleck, S. A.; Knuteson, R. L.; Dewitt, E. D.; Eisman, R. C.; Nemkov, T.; D'Alessandro, A.; Tennessen, J. M.; Weaver, L. N.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553385\nThe ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.\nSedentary behavior may accelerate aging through impact on epigenome and transcriptome: lessons from muscle inactivation in Drosophila larvae\nAuthors: Brener, A.; Lorber, D.; Reuveny, A.; Toledano, H.; Porat-Kuperstein, L.; Lebenthal, Y.; Weizman, E.; Olender, T.; Volk, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555053\nAim: The biological mechanisms linking sedentary lifestyles and metabolic derangements are incompletely understood. Our animal model mimics sedentary behavior during early life, enabling us to explore the associated chromatin epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes. Methods: Drosophila larvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the shibire1 (shi) gene were used. shi homozygous mutant larvae undergo instant arrest of muscle contraction at a restrictive temperature (30C), without affecting other systems. Both shi and control (y,w) larvae were held at permissive temperature (18C), and transferred to restrictive temperature (30C) for six hours. Larvae were then dissected, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies specific for epigenetic marks of chromatin activation (H3K9ac) and repression (H3K27me3), and their fluorescence signal was quantified. In addition, whole genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA in muscle-specific inactive, or control larvae was performed using muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol. Results: Inducing muscle inactivity in shi larvae at 300C yielded a significantly higher ratio between chromatin activation and repression, based upon H3K9ac/H3K27me3 signals (p=0.025), relative to all control groups for which this ratio was comparable (p=0.995). Furthermore, muscle inactivation led to altered Pol II binding to 121 out of 2010 genes (6%). The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. In addition, a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs was noted in the muscle-inactive larvae. Conclusion: Inducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin, triggering an altered epigenetic balance, as well as downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes essential for muscle function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity and others. Extrapolating these findings to humans holds promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases.\nLean female mice producing trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid present excessive fibroblast growth factor 21, adrenaline, prostaglandin E2, corticosterone, and glucagon\nAuthors: Rao, Y.; Liang, L.; Li, M.; Wang, Y.; Wang, B.; Gou, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.21.536206\nDietary trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) has been shown to induce white fat reduction. In this study, the transgenic mice that produce endogenous t10c12-CLA were used to determine the long-term impact of this substance on lipid metabolism in lean female mammals. Phenotype profiling showed that the t10c12-CLA did not induce fat loss but resulted in less heat release and oxygen consumption, as well as excessive adrenaline, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in either biallelic Pai/Pai or monoallelic Pai/wt mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the following effects of t10c12-CLA were genotype-specific. Pai/wt mice specifically exhibited increased chronic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and reduced physical activities. Contrarily, Pai/Pai mice showed the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), corticosterone, and glucagon, accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Further analysis of Pai/Pai livers revealed that the steatosis resulted from attenuated lipid metabolism via down-regulating phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase. Analysis of Pai/Pai brown adipose tissue indicated stimulated thermogenesis and lipolysis by up-regulating uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, and AMPK, as well as down-regulating phosphorylated AMPK. These results suggest that chronic t10c12-CLA may affect lipid metabolism by stimulating the overproduction of multiple hormones (FGF21, PEG2, adrenaline, etc.) in a dose-dependent manner in lean female mammals.\nSerotonin therapies for opioid-induced dysphagia and respiratory depression: sex differences in a rat electromyography model\nAuthors: Frazure, M.; Morimoto, I.; Fielder, N.; Mellen, N.; Iceman, K.; Pitts, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554164\nOpioids are well-known to cause respiratory depression, but despite clinical evidence of dysphagia, the effects of opioids on swallow excitability and motor pattern are unknown. We sought to test the effects of the clinically-relevant opioid buprenorphine on pharyngeal swallow and respiratory drive in male and female rats. We also evaluated utility of serotonin 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and buspirone) to improve swallowing and breathing outcomes following buprenorphine administration. Experiments were performed on 44 freely breathing Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Bipolar fine wire electrodes were inserted into the mylohyoid, thyroarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, thyropharyngeus and diaphragm muscles to measure electromyographic (EMG) activity of swallowing and breathing behaviors. We evaluated the hypotheses that swallow varies by stimulus, opioids depress swallow and breathing, and that 5-HT1A agonists improve these depressions. Our results largely confirmed the hypotheses: 1) Swallow-related muscle activity was larger during swallows elicited by oral water infusion plus esophageal distension than by either stimulus alone. 2) Buprenorphine depressed swallow in both sexes, but most significantly in females. 3) Female animals were more susceptible to buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest. 4) 8-OH-DPAT rescued breathing following buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest, and pre-treatment with the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone prevented buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest in female animals. 5) 8- OH-DPAT enhanced swallow-related mylohyoid drive, but did not restore excitability of the swallow pattern generator following total suppression by buprenorphine. Our results highlight sex-specific and behavior-specific effects of buprenorphine and provide pre-clinical evidence of a 5HT1A agonist for the treatment of respiratory depression and dysphagia. New \u0026 NoteworthyThis is the first manuscript to evaluate sex-specific effects of opioid administration on pharyngeal swallow. We expand on a small but growing number of studies that report a lower threshold for opioid-induced respiratory depression in females than males, and are the first to produce this effect with the partial mu-opioid-receptor agonist buprenorphine. Our study is the first to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors can improve swallow and breathing outcomes following systemic buprenorphine administration.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Elephant trunks have folds and wrinkles, but we don&#39;t know how wrinkles differ between elephant species and how trunks and their wrinkles develop. Adult Asian elephants have significantly more dorsal major trunk wrinkles (~126 &#43;/- 25 SD) than African elephants (~83 &#43;/- 13 SD). There are more dorsal than ventral major trunk wrinkles and there is a closer wrinkle spacing distally than proximally. Wrinkle numbers differed slightly as a function of trunk-lateralization. MicroCT-imaging revealed a relatively constant thickness of the outer elephant trunk skin, whereas the inner skin parts are thicker between folds than in folds. The trunk shows the greatest fetal length growth of elephant body parts. Trunk wrinkles are added in an early exponential phase, where wrinkles double every 20 days, and a later phase, where wrinkles are added slowly and at a faster rate in Asian compared to African elephants. We suggest wrinkles improve the ability of trunk skin to bend.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insufficient regeneration is implicated in muscle pathologies, but much remains unknown about the regenerative output of individual muscle stem cells, called satellite cells (SCs). Prior work showed that individual SCs contribute to regeneration of more than one muscle fiber (&#34;fiber-crossing&#34;) after full-muscle damage. We investigated whether fiber-crossing also occurred in different regions of a localized muscle injury. To assess fiber-crossing with a minimum number of mice, we used lineage tracing with confetti fluorescence, and developed a novel stochastic modeling method to interpret the ambiguity of multi-color fluorescent lineage tags. Microscopy of the regenerated muscle showed that adjacent fibers often expressed the same colored tags. Computational analysis concluded that the observed color patches would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance unless SCs contributed myonuclei to multiple adjacent fibers (26-33% of SCs contributing to at most 1-2 additional fibers). Interestingly, these results were similar across the different regions studied, suggesting that severe destruction is not required for fiber-crossing. Our method to assess fiber-crossing may be useful for future study of gene and cell therapies that use fiber-crossing to aid muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe contribution of platelets in thrombosis within microcirculation has been extensively documented in the literature. We previously showed, in vivo, that platelet activation revealed by intracellular calcium mobilization was a crucial step in the growth of thrombi following laser-induced injury, a model of thromboinflammation.

AimWe employed a multimodal, correlative microscopy approach and computational biology to investigate the extent of platelet activation and the spatial distribution of platelets throughout a growing thrombus.

ResultsWe observed a reversible intracellular platelet calcium mobilization that correlates with the time a platelet resides during thrombus growth. Our bioinformatics analysis displayed three distinct platelet subpopulations resident within a thrombus: (1) resting, (2) partially activated, and (3) &#34;fully&#34; activated platelets. The spatial distribution of the platelet subpopulations in the thrombus creates a double gradient in both the transversal and longitudinal axis, with the maximal percentage of fully activated platelets close to the site of injury. However, these activated platelets did not express negative phospholipids. The injured endothelium was identified to play a vital role in activating the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thrombosis.

ConclusionFollowing a laser-induced injury, thrombi are formed by a gradient of activated platelets from the injury site to the periphery of the thrombus. These different activation states of platelets throughout the thrombi regulate the biomechanics of the thrombus. The injured endothelium, rather than platelets, was identified to play a key role in the activation of the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thromboinflammation.

        <p class="abstract">Myonuclear domain (MND) is the theoretical volume of cytoplasm within which a myonucleus is responsible for transcribing DNA. Changes in myonuclear number, organisation, and myonuclear domain size are associated with exercise adaptations and ageing. However, data on satellite cell activation, changes in MND volumes and myonuclear arrangement following exercise are inconsistent. Additionally, whether MNDs and myonuclear arrangement are altered with age remains unclear. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate relationships between age and activity status and myonuclear numbers and organisation. Muscle fibres from younger trained (YT) and older trained (OT) individuals were compared with age-matched untrained counterparts (YU and OU). Serial, optical z-slices were acquired throughout isolated muscle fibres and analysed to give 3D coordinates for myonuclei and muscle fibre dimensions, respectively. As expected, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) (um2) of muscle fibres from OU was 29-42% smaller compared to the other groups. Number of nuclei relative to fibre CSA was 87% greater in OU compared to YU muscle fibres (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, scaling of myonuclear domain volume with fibre size was altered in older untrained individuals. Myonuclear arrangement, on the other hand, was similar across groups. These data indicate that regular endurance exercise throughout the lifespan may preserve the size of single muscle fibres in older age and maintain the relationship between fibre size and MND volumes. Inactivity, however, may result in reduced muscle fibre size and disrupted relationship between fibre size and MND volumes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized for thermogenesis because it contains uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. BAT is also an endocrine organ, producing many signalling molecules important for regulating the metabolism of peripheral organs. Mounting evidence suggest that histone modifying enzymes are integral for the development, tissue maintenance, and postnatal functioning of brown and beige adipocytes. p300 and its functional homologue CREB-binding protein (CBP) are histone acetyltransferases that form the transcriptionally activating histone 3 acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac) mark. Using Ucp1-Cre, we examined the requirement of p300 activity specifically within thermogenic adipocytes. We hypothesized that loss of p300 activity would impair gene programming integral for BAT development/function, rendering knockouts susceptible to metabolic dysfunction and unable to form beige adipocytes. Despite successful knockdown, brown fat was completely unaffected by p300 deletion. As such, knockout mice showed a comparable metabolic profile to littermate controls in response to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, de novo beige adipogenesis within subcutaneous fat by a {beta}3 adrenergic agonist remained intact in knockout mice. Although p300 and CBP have non-overlapping roles in other tissues, our results indicate p300 HAT activity is dispensable within thermogenic fats, likely due to functional compensation by CBP.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aim: The biological mechanisms linking sedentary lifestyles and metabolic derangements are incompletely understood. Our animal model mimics sedentary behavior during early life, enabling us to explore the associated chromatin epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes. Methods: Drosophila larvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the shibire1 (shi) gene were used. shi homozygous mutant larvae undergo instant arrest of muscle contraction at a restrictive temperature (30C), without affecting other systems. Both shi and control (y,w) larvae were held at permissive temperature (18C), and transferred to restrictive temperature (30C) for six hours. Larvae were then dissected, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies specific for epigenetic marks of chromatin activation (H3K9ac) and repression (H3K27me3), and their fluorescence signal was quantified. In addition, whole genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA in muscle-specific inactive, or control larvae was performed using muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol. Results: Inducing muscle inactivity in shi larvae at 300C yielded a significantly higher ratio between chromatin activation and repression, based upon H3K9ac/H3K27me3 signals (p=0.025), relative to all control groups for which this ratio was comparable (p=0.995). Furthermore, muscle inactivation led to altered Pol II binding to 121 out of 2010 genes (6%). The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. In addition, a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs was noted in the muscle-inactive larvae. Conclusion: Inducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin, triggering an altered epigenetic balance, as well as downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes essential for muscle function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity and others. Extrapolating these findings to humans holds promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) has been shown to induce white fat reduction. In this study, the transgenic mice that produce endogenous t10c12-CLA were used to determine the long-term impact of this substance on lipid metabolism in lean female mammals. Phenotype profiling showed that the t10c12-CLA did not induce fat loss but resulted in less heat release and oxygen consumption, as well as excessive adrenaline, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in either biallelic Pai/Pai or monoallelic Pai/wt mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the following effects of t10c12-CLA were genotype-specific. Pai/wt mice specifically exhibited increased chronic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and reduced physical activities. Contrarily, Pai/Pai mice showed the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), corticosterone, and glucagon, accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Further analysis of Pai/Pai livers revealed that the steatosis resulted from attenuated lipid metabolism via down-regulating phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase. Analysis of Pai/Pai brown adipose tissue indicated stimulated thermogenesis and lipolysis by up-regulating uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, and AMPK, as well as down-regulating phosphorylated AMPK. These results suggest that chronic t10c12-CLA may affect lipid metabolism by stimulating the overproduction of multiple hormones (FGF21, PEG2, adrenaline, etc.) in a dose-dependent manner in lean female mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Opioids are well-known to cause respiratory depression, but despite clinical evidence of dysphagia, the effects of opioids on swallow excitability and motor pattern are unknown. We sought to test the effects of the clinically-relevant opioid buprenorphine on pharyngeal swallow and respiratory drive in male and female rats. We also evaluated utility of serotonin 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and buspirone) to improve swallowing and breathing outcomes following buprenorphine administration. Experiments were performed on 44 freely breathing Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Bipolar fine wire electrodes were inserted into the mylohyoid, thyroarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, thyropharyngeus and diaphragm muscles to measure electromyographic (EMG) activity of swallowing and breathing behaviors. We evaluated the hypotheses that swallow varies by stimulus, opioids depress swallow and breathing, and that 5-HT1A agonists improve these depressions. Our results largely confirmed the hypotheses: 1) Swallow-related muscle activity was larger during swallows elicited by oral water infusion plus esophageal distension than by either stimulus alone. 2) Buprenorphine depressed swallow in both sexes, but most significantly in females. 3) Female animals were more susceptible to buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest. 4) 8-OH-DPAT rescued breathing following buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest, and pre-treatment with the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone prevented buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest in female animals. 5) 8- OH-DPAT enhanced swallow-related mylohyoid drive, but did not restore excitability of the swallow pattern generator following total suppression by buprenorphine. Our results highlight sex-specific and behavior-specific effects of buprenorphine and provide pre-clinical evidence of a 5HT1A agonist for the treatment of respiratory depression and dysphagia.

New &amp; NoteworthyThis is the first manuscript to evaluate sex-specific effects of opioid administration on pharyngeal swallow. We expand on a small but growing number of studies that report a lower threshold for opioid-induced respiratory depression in females than males, and are the first to produce this effect with the partial mu-opioid-receptor agonist buprenorphine. Our study is the first to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors can improve swallow and breathing outcomes following systemic buprenorphine administration.</p>
