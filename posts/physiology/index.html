R.; Krook, A.; Giavalisco, P.; Mann, M.; Larsson, N.-G.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558955\nThe oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.\nImmunohistochemical and ultrastructural characterization of the inner ear epithelial cells of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa)\nAuthors: Kwan, G. T.; Prime, K. J.; Andrade, L. R.; Tresguerres, M.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558895\nThe inner ear of teleost fish regulates the ionic and acid-base chemistry and secretes the protein matrix of the endolymph to facilitate otolith biomineralization, which are used to maintain vestibular and auditory functions. The otolith is biomineralized in a concentric ring pattern corresponding to seasonal growth, and this CaCO3 polycrystal has become a vital aging and life-history tool for fishery managers, ecologists, and conservation biologists. Moreover, biomineralization patterns are sensitive to environmental variability including climate change, thereby threatening the accuracy and relevance of otolith-reliant toolkits. However, the cellular biology of the inner ear is poorly characterized, which is a hurdle for a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. This study provides a systematic characterization of the cell types in the inner ear of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the apical morphologies of the six inner ear cell types. Additionally, immunostaining and confocal microscopy characterized the expression and subcellular localization of the proteins Na+/K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, V-type H+-ATPase, Na+-K+-2Cl--Co-Transporter, Otolith Matrix Protein 1, and Otolin-1 in six inner ear cell types bordering the endolymph. This fundamental cytological characterization of the rockfish inner ear epithelium illustrates the intricate physiological processes involved in otolith biomineralization, and highlights how greater mechanistic understanding is necessary to predict their multi-stressor responses to future climate change.\nAutophagy contributes to homeostasis in esophageal epithelium where high autophagic vesicle content marks basal cells with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal potential\nAuthors: Klochkova, A.; Karami, A. L.; Fuller, A. D.; Parham, L. R.; Panchani, S. R.; Natarajan, S.; Jackson, J. L.; Mu, A.; Tan, Y.; Cai, K. Q.; Klein-Szanto, A.; Muir, A. B.; Tetreault, M.-P.; Hamilton, K. E.; Whelan, K. A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558614\nBackground \u0026 Aims: Autophagy has been demonstrated to play roles in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Here, we aim to define the role of autophagy in esophageal epithelium under homeostatic conditions. Methods: We generated tamoxifen-inducible, squamous epithelial-specific Atg7 (autophagy related 7) conditional knockout mice to evaluate effects on esophageal homeostasis and response to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) using histological and biochemical analyses. We FACS sorted esophageal basal cells based upon fluorescence of the autophagic vesicle (AV)-identifying dye Cyto-ID, then subjected these cells to transmission electron microscopy, image flow cytometry, 3D organoid assays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and cell cycle analysis. 3D organoids were subjected to passaging, single cell (sc) RNA-Seq, cell cycle analysis, and immunostaining. Results: Genetic autophagy inhibition in squamous epithelium resulted in increased proliferation of esophageal basal cells. Esophageal basal cells with high AV level (Cyto-IDHigh) displayed limited organoid formation capability upon initial plating but passaged more efficiently than their counterparts with low AV level (Cyto-IDLow). RNA-Seq suggested increased autophagy in Cyto-IDHigh esophageal basal cells along with decreased cell cycle progression, the latter of which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. scRNA-Seq of 3D organoids generated by Cyto-IDLow and Cyto-IDHigh cells identified expansion of 3 cell populations, enrichment of G2/M-associated genes, and aberrant localization of cell cycle-associated genes beyond basal cell populations in the Cyto-IDHigh group. Ki67 expression was also increased in organoids generated by Cyto-IDHigh cells, including in cells beyond the basal cell layer. Squamous epithelial-specific autophagy inhibition induced significant weight loss in mice treated with 4NQO that further displayed perturbed epithelial tissue architecture. Conclusions: High AV level identifies esophageal epithelium with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal capacity that contributes to maintenance of the esophageal proliferation-differentiation gradient in vivo.\nThe effects of queen mandibular pheromone on nurse-aged honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) hypopharyngeal gland size and lipid metabolism\nAuthors: Oreshkova, A.; Scofield, S.; Amdam, G. V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559206\nQueen honey bees (Apis mellifera ) release Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) to regulate traits in the caste of female helpers called workers. QMP signals the queens presence and suppresses worker reproduction. In the absence of reproduction, young workers take care of the queen and her larvae (nurse tasks), while older workers forage. In nurses, QMP increases lipid stores in abdominal fat tissue (fat body) and protein content in hypopharyngeal glands (HPG). HPG are worker-specific head glands that can synthesize royal jelly used in colony nourishment. Larger HPG signifies ability to secrete royal jelly, while shrunken glands characterize foragers that do not make jelly. While it is known that QMP increases abdominal lipid stores, the mechanism is unclear: Does QMP make workers consume more pollen which provides lipids, or does QMP increase lipogenic capacity? Here, we measure abdominal lipogenic capacity as fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity while monitoring abdominal protein content and HPG size in caged workers. Cages allow us to rigorously control worker age, pheromone exposure, and diet. In our 2-factorial design, 3- vs. 8-day-old workers (age factor) were exposed to synthetic QMP or not (pheromone factor) while consuming a lipid deficient diet. We found that QMP did not influence abdominal FAS activity or protein content, but QMP still increased HPG size in the absence of dietary lipids. Our data revealed a positive correlation between abdominal protein content and HPG size. Our findings show that QMP is not a strong modulator of lipogenic capacity in caged worker bees. However, our data may reflect that QMP mobilizes abdominal protein for production of jelly, in line with previous findings on effects of honey bee Brood Pheromone. Overall, our study expands the understanding of how QMP can affect honey bee workers. Such insights are important beyond regulatory biology, as QMP is used in various aspects of beekeeping.\nValidity and reliability of a new whole room indirect calorimeter to assess metabolic response to small-calorie loads\nAuthors: Baugh, M. E.; Ahrens, M. L.; Hutelin, Z.; Stylianos, C.; Wohlers-Kariesch, E.; Oster, M. E.; Dotson, J.; Moon, J.; Hanlon, A. L. E.; DiFeliceantonio, A. G.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558672\nObjective: To provide an overview of our whole room indirect calorimeter (WRIC), demonstrate validity and reliability of our WRIC, and explore a novel application of Bayesian hierarchical modeling to assess responses to small carbohydrate loads. Methods: Seven gas infusion studies were performed using a gas blender and profiles designed to mimic resting and postprandial metabolic events to assess WRIC validity. In a crossover design, 16 participants underwent fasting and postprandial measurements, during which they consumed a 75-kcal drink containing sucrose, dextrose, or fructose. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare resting and postprandial metabolic rate (MR) and CO (CO). Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling was also used to model postprandial CO trajectories for each participant and condition. Results: Mean total error in infusions were 1.27 +- 1.16% and 0.42 +- 1.21% for VO2 and VCO2 respectively, indicating a high level of validity. Mean resting MR was similar across conditions (mean =1.05 +- 0.03 kcal/min, p=0.82, ICC: 0.91). While MR increased similarly among all conditions (~13%, p=0.29), postprandial CO parameters were significantly lower for dextrose compared with sucrose or fructose. Conclusions: Our WRIC validation and novel application of statistical methods presented here provide important foundations for new research directions using WRIC.\nDirect Regulation of the Voltage Sensor of HCN Channels by Membrane Lipid Compartmentalization\nAuthors: Handlin, L. J.; Dai, G.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545112\nIon channels function within a membrane environment characterized by dynamic lipid compartmentalization. Limited knowledge exists regarding the response of voltage-gated ion channels to transmembrane potential within distinct membrane compartments. By leveraging fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we visualized the localization of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in membrane domains. HCN4 exhibits a greater propensity for incorporation into ordered lipid domains compared to HCN1. To investigate the conformational changes of the S4 helix voltage sensor of HCN channels, we used dual stop-codon suppression to incorporate different noncanonical amino acids, orthogonal click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling, and transition metal FLIM-FRET. Remarkably, altered FRET levels were observed between VSD sites within HCN channels upon disruption of membrane domains. We propose that the voltage-sensor rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases.\nA Genetically Encoded Actuator Selectively Boosts L-type Calcium Channels in Diverse Physiological Settings\nAuthors: del Rivero Morfin, P. J.; Scala Chavez, D.; Jayaraman, S.; Yang, L.; Kochiss, A.; Colecraft, H. M.; Liu, X. S.; Marx, S. O.; Rajadhyaksha, A. M.; Ben-Johny, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558856\nL-type Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2/1.3) convey influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) that orchestrate a bevy of biological responses including muscle contraction and gene transcription. Deficits in CaV1 function play a vital role in cardiac and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet conventional pharmacological approaches to upregulate CaV1 are limited, as excessive Ca2+ influx leads to cytotoxicity. Here, we develop a genetically encoded enhancer of CaV1.2/1.3 channels (GeeC) to manipulate Ca2+ entry in distinct physiological settings. Specifically, we functionalized a nanobody that targets the CaV macromolecular complex by attaching a minimal effector domain from a CaV enhancer-leucine rich repeat containing protein 10 (Lrrc10). In cardiomyocytes, GeeC evoked a 3-fold increase in L-type current amplitude. In neurons, GeeC augmented excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling. In all, GeeC represents a powerful strategy to boost CaV1.2/1.3 function in distinct physiological settings and, in so doing, lays the groundwork to illuminate new insights on neuronal and cardiac physiology and disease.\nCalcium-dependent transcriptional profiles of human pancreatic islet cells reveal functional diversity in islet subpopulations\nAuthors: Yoon, J. S.; Sasaki, S.; Velghe, J.; Zosel, K.; Lee, M. Y. Y.; Winata, H.; Nian, C.; Lynn, F. C.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556709\nAims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity. MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells. ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function. ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.

        <p class="abstract">The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in mammalian mitochondria plays a key role in harvesting energy from ingested nutrients1, 2. Mitochondrial metabolism is very dynamic and can be reprogrammed to support both catabolic and anabolic reactions, depending on physiological demands or disease states3, 4. Rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism is intricately linked to metabolic diseases5, 6 and is also necessary to promote tumour growth7-11. Here, we demonstrate that per oral treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (IMT)11 shifts whole animal metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, leads to rapid normalization of body weight, reversal of hepatosteatosis and restoration of glucose tolerance in mice on high-fat diet. Paradoxically, the IMT treatment causes a severe reduction of OXPHOS capacity concomitant with a marked upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, as determined by proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. The IMT treatment leads to a marked reduction of complex I, the main dehydrogenase that feeds electrons into the ubiquinone (Q) pool, whereas the levels of electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) and other dehydrogenases connected to the Q pool are increased. This rewiring of metabolism caused by reduced mtDNA expression in the liver provides a novel principle for drug treatment of obesity and obesity-related pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The inner ear of teleost fish regulates the ionic and acid-base chemistry and secretes the protein matrix of the endolymph to facilitate otolith biomineralization, which are used to maintain vestibular and auditory functions. The otolith is biomineralized in a concentric ring pattern corresponding to seasonal growth, and this CaCO3 polycrystal has become a vital aging and life-history tool for fishery managers, ecologists, and conservation biologists. Moreover, biomineralization patterns are sensitive to environmental variability including climate change, thereby threatening the accuracy and relevance of otolith-reliant toolkits. However, the cellular biology of the inner ear is poorly characterized, which is a hurdle for a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. This study provides a systematic characterization of the cell types in the inner ear of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the apical morphologies of the six inner ear cell types. Additionally, immunostaining and confocal microscopy characterized the expression and subcellular localization of the proteins Na&#43;/K&#43;-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, V-type H&#43;-ATPase, Na&#43;-K&#43;-2Cl--Co-Transporter, Otolith Matrix Protein 1, and Otolin-1 in six inner ear cell types bordering the endolymph. This fundamental cytological characterization of the rockfish inner ear epithelium illustrates the intricate physiological processes involved in otolith biomineralization, and highlights how greater mechanistic understanding is necessary to predict their multi-stressor responses to future climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; Aims: Autophagy has been demonstrated to play roles in esophageal pathologies both benign and malignant. Here, we aim to define the role of autophagy in esophageal epithelium under homeostatic conditions. Methods: We generated tamoxifen-inducible, squamous epithelial-specific Atg7 (autophagy related 7) conditional knockout mice to evaluate effects on esophageal homeostasis and response to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) using histological and biochemical analyses. We FACS sorted esophageal basal cells based upon fluorescence of the autophagic vesicle (AV)-identifying dye Cyto-ID, then subjected these cells to transmission electron microscopy, image flow cytometry, 3D organoid assays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and cell cycle analysis. 3D organoids were subjected to passaging, single cell (sc) RNA-Seq, cell cycle analysis, and immunostaining. Results: Genetic autophagy inhibition in squamous epithelium resulted in increased proliferation of esophageal basal cells. Esophageal basal cells with high AV level (Cyto-IDHigh) displayed limited organoid formation capability upon initial plating but passaged more efficiently than their counterparts with low AV level (Cyto-IDLow). RNA-Seq suggested increased autophagy in Cyto-IDHigh esophageal basal cells along with decreased cell cycle progression, the latter of which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. scRNA-Seq of 3D organoids generated by Cyto-IDLow and Cyto-IDHigh cells identified expansion of 3 cell populations, enrichment of G2/M-associated genes, and aberrant localization of cell cycle-associated genes beyond basal cell populations in the Cyto-IDHigh group. Ki67 expression was also increased in organoids generated by Cyto-IDHigh cells, including in cells beyond the basal cell layer. Squamous epithelial-specific autophagy inhibition induced significant weight loss in mice treated with 4NQO that further displayed perturbed epithelial tissue architecture. Conclusions: High AV level identifies esophageal epithelium with limited proliferation and enhanced self-renewal capacity that contributes to maintenance of the esophageal proliferation-differentiation gradient in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Queen honey bees (Apis mellifera ) release Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) to regulate traits in the caste of female helpers called workers. QMP signals the queens presence and suppresses worker reproduction. In the absence of reproduction, young workers take care of the queen and her larvae (nurse tasks), while older workers forage. In nurses, QMP increases lipid stores in abdominal fat tissue (fat body) and protein content in hypopharyngeal glands (HPG). HPG are worker-specific head glands that can synthesize royal jelly used in colony nourishment. Larger HPG signifies ability to secrete royal jelly, while shrunken glands characterize foragers that do not make jelly. While it is known that QMP increases abdominal lipid stores, the mechanism is unclear: Does QMP make workers consume more pollen which provides lipids, or does QMP increase lipogenic capacity? Here, we measure abdominal lipogenic capacity as fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity while monitoring abdominal protein content and HPG size in caged workers. Cages allow us to rigorously control worker age, pheromone exposure, and diet. In our 2-factorial design, 3- vs. 8-day-old workers (age factor) were exposed to synthetic QMP or not (pheromone factor) while consuming a lipid deficient diet. We found that QMP did not influence abdominal FAS activity or protein content, but QMP still increased HPG size in the absence of dietary lipids. Our data revealed a positive correlation between abdominal protein content and HPG size. Our findings show that QMP is not a strong modulator of lipogenic capacity in caged worker bees. However, our data may reflect that QMP mobilizes abdominal protein for production of jelly, in line with previous findings on effects of honey bee Brood Pheromone. Overall, our study expands the understanding of how QMP can affect honey bee workers. Such insights are important beyond regulatory biology, as QMP is used in various aspects of beekeeping.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: To provide an overview of our whole room indirect calorimeter (WRIC), demonstrate validity and reliability of our WRIC, and explore a novel application of Bayesian hierarchical modeling to assess responses to small carbohydrate loads. Methods: Seven gas infusion studies were performed using a gas blender and profiles designed to mimic resting and postprandial metabolic events to assess WRIC validity. In a crossover design, 16 participants underwent fasting and postprandial measurements, during which they consumed a 75-kcal drink containing sucrose, dextrose, or fructose. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare resting and postprandial metabolic rate (MR) and CO (CO). Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling was also used to model postprandial CO trajectories for each participant and condition. Results: Mean total error in infusions were 1.27 &#43;- 1.16% and 0.42 &#43;- 1.21% for VO2 and VCO2 respectively, indicating a high level of validity. Mean resting MR was similar across conditions (mean =1.05 &#43;- 0.03 kcal/min, p=0.82, ICC: 0.91). While MR increased similarly among all conditions (~13%, p=0.29), postprandial CO parameters were significantly lower for dextrose compared with sucrose or fructose. Conclusions: Our WRIC validation and novel application of statistical methods presented here provide important foundations for new research directions using WRIC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ion channels function within a membrane environment characterized by dynamic lipid compartmentalization. Limited knowledge exists regarding the response of voltage-gated ion channels to transmembrane potential within distinct membrane compartments. By leveraging fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we visualized the localization of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in membrane domains. HCN4 exhibits a greater propensity for incorporation into ordered lipid domains compared to HCN1. To investigate the conformational changes of the S4 helix voltage sensor of HCN channels, we used dual stop-codon suppression to incorporate different noncanonical amino acids, orthogonal click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling, and transition metal FLIM-FRET. Remarkably, altered FRET levels were observed between VSD sites within HCN channels upon disruption of membrane domains. We propose that the voltage-sensor rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">L-type Ca2&#43; channels (CaV1.2/1.3) convey influx of calcium ions (Ca2&#43;) that orchestrate a bevy of biological responses including muscle contraction and gene transcription. Deficits in CaV1 function play a vital role in cardiac and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet conventional pharmacological approaches to upregulate CaV1 are limited, as excessive Ca2&#43; influx leads to cytotoxicity. Here, we develop a genetically encoded enhancer of CaV1.2/1.3 channels (GeeC) to manipulate Ca2&#43; entry in distinct physiological settings. Specifically, we functionalized a nanobody that targets the CaV macromolecular complex by attaching a minimal effector domain from a CaV enhancer-leucine rich repeat containing protein 10 (Lrrc10). In cardiomyocytes, GeeC evoked a 3-fold increase in L-type current amplitude. In neurons, GeeC augmented excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling. In all, GeeC represents a powerful strategy to boost CaV1.2/1.3 function in distinct physiological settings and, in so doing, lays the groundwork to illuminate new insights on neuronal and cardiac physiology and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesisPancreatic islets depend on cytosolic calcium to trigger the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones and regulate the transcription of genes important for the response to stimuli. To date, there has not been an attempt to profile calcium-regulated gene expression in all islet cell types. Our aim was to construct a large single-cell transcriptomic dataset from human islets exposed to conditions that would acutely induce or inhibit intracellular calcium signalling, while preserving biological heterogeneity.

MethodsWe exposed intact human islets from three donors to the following conditions: (1) 2.8 mM glucose; (2) 16 mM glucose and 40 mM KCl to maximally stimulate calcium signalling; and (3) 16 mM glucose, 40 mM KCl and 5 mM EGTA (calcium chelator) to inhibit calcium signalling, for 1 hour. We sequenced 43,909 cells from all islet cell types, and further subsetted the cells to form an endocrine cell-specific dataset of 32,486 cells expressing INS, GCG, SST or PPY. We compared transcriptomes across conditions to determine the differentially expressed calcium-regulated genes in each endocrine cell type, and in each endocrine cell subcluster of alpha and beta cells.

ResultsBased on the number of calcium-regulated genes, we found that each alpha and beta cell cluster had a different magnitude of calcium response. We also showed that a polyhormonal cluster expressing INS, GCG, and SST is defined by calcium-regulated genes specific to this cluster. Finally, we identified the gene PCDH7 from the beta cell clusters that had the highest number of calcium-regulated genes, and showed that cells expressing cell surface PCDH7 protein have enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretory function.

ConclusionsHere we use our single-cell dataset to show that human islets have cell-type-specific calcium-regulated gene expression profiles, some of them specific to subpopulations. In our dataset, we identify PCDH7 as a novel marker of beta cells having an increased number of calcium-regulated genes and enhanced insulin secretory function.
