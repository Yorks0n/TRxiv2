K.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561459\nAlthough lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups. To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this \"900-day rule\" we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.\nTMEM65 regulates NCLX-dependent mitochondrial calcium efflux\nAuthors: Garbincius, J. F.; Salik, O.; Cohen, H. M.; Choya-Foces, C.; Mangold, A. S.; Makhoul, A. D.; Schmidt, A. E.; Khalil, D. Y.; Doolittle, J. J.; Wilkinson, A. S.; Murray, E. K.; Lazaropoulos, M. P.; Hildebrand, A. N.; Tomar, D.; Elrod, J. W.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561062\nThe balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2+ overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2+ efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2+ overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na+)-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2+ efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na+-dependent mCa2+ efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2+ overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2+ stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2+ overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2+ homeostasis.\nLoss of TMEM65 causes mitochondrial disease mediated by mitochondrial calcium\nAuthors: Zhang, Y.; Reyes, L.; Sun, J.; Liu, C.; Springer, D.; Noguchi, A. C.; Aponte, A. M.; Munasinghe, J.; Covian, R.; Murphy, E.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.02.502535\nTransmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65) depletion in a patient carrying a homozygous variant in the Tmem65 splice site resulted in severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy1, indicating the clinical importance of TMEM65. However, the function of TMEM65 remains unknown. Here, we generated a TMEM65 reporter mouse as well as whole-body and tissue-specific Tmem65 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the localization and function of TMEM65. We show that TMEM65 is localized to mitochondria in heart, skeletal muscle, and throughout the brain. Both whole-body and nervous system-specific Tmem65 KO result in severe growth retardation and sudden death following seizures ~3 weeks after birth, indicating TMEM65 is indispensable for normal brain function. In addition, we find that skeletal muscle-specific Tmem65 KO leads to progressive, adult-onset myopathy preceded by elevated mitochondrial calcium levels despite unaltered expression of known mitochondrial or cellular calcium handling proteins. Consistently, we demonstrate that ablation of TMEM65 results in a loss of sodium-dependent mitochondrial calcium export. Finally, we show that blocking mitochondrial calcium entry through removal of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) rescues the early lethality of whole-body TMEM65 ablation. Our data not only reveal the essential role of TMEM65 in mammalian physiology, but also suggest modulating mitochondrial calcium may offer a potential therapeutical approach to address defects associated with TMEM65 misexpression.\nA red-emitting carborhodamine for monitoring and measuring membrane potential\nAuthors: Gest, A. M. M.; Lazzari-Dean, J. R.; Ortiz, G.; Yaeger-Weiss, S. K.; Boggess, S. C.; Miller, E. W.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561080\nBiological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes. Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both. We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence. Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages. Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.\nMesenchymal-specific Alms1 knockout in mice recapitulates key metabolic features of Alström Syndrome\nAuthors: McKay, E. J.; Luijten, I.; Weng, X.; Martinez de Morentin, P. B.; De Frutos Gonzalez, E.; Gao, Z.; Kolonin, M. G.; Heisler, L. K.; Semple, R. K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562074\nBackground: Alstrom Syndrome (AS), a multi-system disease caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, includes obesity with disproportionately severe insulin resistant diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hepatosteatosis. How loss of ALMS1 causes this phenotype is poorly understood, but prior studies have circumstancially implicated impaired adipose tissue expandability. We set out to test this by comparing the metabolic effects of selective Alms1 knockout in mesenchymal cells including preadipocytes to those of global Alms1 knockout. Methods: Global Alms1 knockout (KO) mice were generated by crossing floxed Alms1 and CAG-Cre mice. A Pdgfr-Cre driver was used to abrogate Alms1 function selectively in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their descendants, including preadipocytes. We combined metabolic phenotyping of global and Pdgfr+ Alms1-KO mice on a 45% fat diet with measurements of body composition and food intake, and histological analysis of metabolic tissues. Results: Global Alms1 KO caused hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and fatty liver. Pdgfr-cre driven KO of Alms1 (MSC KO) recapitulated insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidaemia in both sexes. Other phenotypes were sexually dimorphic: increased fat mass was only present in female Alms1 MSC KO mice. Hyperphagia was not evident in male Alms1 MSC KO mice, but was found in MSC KO females, despite no neuronal Pdgfr expression. Conclusions: Mesenchymal deletion of Alms1 recapitulates the metabolic features of AS, including severe fatty liver. This confirms a key role for Alms1 in the adipose lineage, where its loss is sufficient to cause systemic metabolic effects and damage to remote organs. AS should be regarded as a forme fruste of lipodystrophy. Therapies should prioritise targeting positive energy balance.\nThe effects of resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged adults\nAuthors: Ruple, B.; Mattingly, M.; Godwin, J.; McIntosh, M.; Kontos, N.; Agyin-Birikorang, A.; Michel, J. M.; Plotkin, D.; Chen, S.-Y.; Ziegenfuss, T.; Fruge, A.; Gladden, L. B.; Robinson, A.; Mobley, C. B.; Mackey, A. L.; Roberts, M.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560958\nDenervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55{+/-}8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7+), denervated myofibers (NCAM+), senescent cells (p16+ or p21+), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p\u003c0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM+ myofibers, or senescent (p16+ or p21+) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While \u003e90% satellite cells were not p16+ or p21+, most p16+ and p21+ cells were Pax7+ (\u003e90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p\u003c0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p\u003c0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM+ myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.\nTransforming the performance of runners with AI-driven training planning and daily adaptivity\nAuthors: Nilsson, L. C.; Sodergard, O.; Rogestedt, J.; Mattsson, C. M.; Larsen, F. J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561160\nBalancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.\nMaternal high-fat diet affects the contents of eggs and causes abnormal development in the medaka fish\nAuthors: Inoue, Y.; Fukushima, M.; Hirasawa, G.; Furukawa, F.; Takeda, H.; Umatani, C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561638\nMaternal nutritional status can affect development and metabolic phenotypes of their progeny in animals. The effects of maternal diet are thought to be mediated mainly by changes inside oocytes such as organelles, maternal RNAs, and metabolites. However, to what extent each factor contributes to offspring phenotypes remains uncertain, especially in viviparous mammalian systems, where factors other than oocytes, such as placenta and milk, need to be considered. Here, using the medaka fish as an oviparous vertebrate model, we examined whether maternal high-fat diet (mHFD) feeding affects offspring development, and what kind of changes occur in the contents of mature eggs. We found that mHFD caused the high frequency of embryonic deformities of offspring, accompanied by downregulation of transcription- and translation-related genes and zygotic transcripts at the blastula stage. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of mature eggs suggested decreased catabolism of amino acids and glycogen, moderate upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, and elevated lipid levels in mHFD eggs. Furthermore, HFD females showed upregulation of follicle-stimulating hormone, a higher incidence of oocyte atresia and downregulation of egg protein genes in the liver. These data suggested that attenuated amino acid catabolism triggered by decreased yolk protein load/processing, as well as elevated lipid levels inside eggs, are the prime candidates that account for the higher incidence of embryonic deformities in mHFD offspring. Our study presents a comprehensive data on the changes inside eggs in mHFD model of non-mammalian vertebrates, and provides insights into the mechanisms of parental nutritional effects on their offspring.\nMouse Model of Heart Attack and Stroke Shows Improved Survival with MPO Inhibition\nAuthors: Shamsuzzaman, S.; Deaton, R.

S.; Walsh, K.; Bekiranov, S.; Kocher, O.; Kreiger, M.; Kull, B.; Persson, M.; Bergenhem, N.; Heydarkhan-Hagvall, S.; Owens, G. K.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561304\nThromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, caused by the rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques are the leading cause of death worldwide1. Unfortunately, the lack of a mouse model that develops advanced coronary atherosclerosis and that exhibits a high incidence of spontaneous plaque rupture with MI or stroke has greatly stymied development of more effective therapeutic approaches for reducing these events beyond what has been achieved with aggressive lipid lowering. Herein, we describe a novel mouse model that develops widespread advanced atherosclerosis including in coronary, brachiocephalic, and carotid arteries. These mice show high mortality following Western Diet feeding with clear evidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. To validate the utility of this model, mice were treated with the drug candidate AZM198, which inhibits myeloperoxidase, an enzyme primarily produced by activated neutrophils and predictive of rupture of human atherosclerotic lesions2-7. AZM198 treatment resulted in marked improvements in survival with a greater than 60% decrease in the incidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. In summary, our work describes a novel mouse model that closely replicates late-stage clinical events of advanced human atherosclerotic disease and evidence that this model can be used to identify and test potential new therapeutic agents to prevent major adverse cardiac events.\nDirect measures of liking and intensity of taste, smell, and chemesthetic stimuli are similar between young people reporting they did or did not have COVID-19\nAuthors: Leszkowicz, E.; Bell, K.; Huang, A.; Nguyen, H.; Reed, D. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561170\nThe recovery period from post-COVID-19 smell and taste dysfunctions varies substantially, lasting from a few days to over a year. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on post-COVID-19 chemosensory sensitivity in a group of young convalescents of eastern/central European ancestry. We measured subjects smell and taste capabilities with a standard testing kit, Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ), and collected surveys on COVID-19 history. During testing, subjects rated liking and intensity of six odor samples (galaxolide, guaiacol, beta-ionone, trimethylamine, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl fenchol) and six taste samples (sucralose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthiocarbamide, menthol, capsaicin) on a scale from 1 (dislike extremely, or no intensity) to 9 (like extremely, or extremely intense). There was no statistical difference in intensity ratings or liking of any sample between subjects who reported a history of COVID-19 (n = 34) and those reporting no history (n = 40), independent of presence/absence or severity of smell/taste impairments (P \u003e 0.05). Additionally, neither vaccination status (full vaccination or no vaccination) nor time from the COVID-19 onset (2-27 months) correlated with liking or intensity. These results suggest that most young adults who had COVID-19 recovered their sense of smell and taste.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although lifespan extension remains the gold standard for assessing interventions hypothesized to impact the biology of aging, there are important limitations to this approach. Our reanalysis of lifespan studies from multiple sources suggests that the use of short-lived control cohorts tends to exaggerate the relative efficacy of putative longevity interventions. Moreover, due to the high cost and long timeframes of mouse studies, it is rare that a particular longevity intervention will be independently replicated by multiple groups.

To facilitate identification of successful interventions, we propose an alternative approach. The level of confidence we can have in an intervention is proportional to the degree of lifespan extension above the strain- and species-specific upper limit of lifespan, which we can estimate from comparison to historical controls. In the absence of independent replication, a putative mouse longevity intervention should only be considered with high confidence when control lifespans are close to 900 days or if the final lifespan of the treated group is considerably above 900 days. Using this &#34;900-day rule&#34; we identified several candidate interventions from the literature that merit follow-up studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The balance between mitochondrial calcium (mCa2&#43;) uptake and efflux regulates ATP production, but if perturbed causes energy starvation or mCa2&#43; overload and cell death. The mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX, is a critical route of mCa2&#43; efflux in excitable tissues, such as the heart and brain, and animal models support NCLX as a promising therapeutic target to limit pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload. However, the mechanisms that regulate NCLX activity remain largely unknown. We used proximity biotinylation proteomic screening to identify the NCLX interactome and define novel regulators of NCLX function. Here, we discover the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, TMEM65, as an NCLX-proximal protein that potently enhances sodium (Na&#43;)-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Mechanistically, acute pharmacologic NCLX inhibition or genetic deletion of NCLX ablates the TMEM65-dependent increase in mCa2&#43; efflux. Further, loss-of-function studies show that TMEM65 is required for Na&#43;-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux. Co-fractionation and in silico structural modeling of TMEM65 and NCLX suggest these two proteins exist in a common macromolecular complex in which TMEM65 directly stimulates NCLX function. In line with these findings, knockdown of Tmem65 in mice promotes mCa2&#43; overload in the heart and skeletal muscle and impairs both cardiac and neuromuscular function. We further demonstrate that TMEM65 deletion causes excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, whereas TMEM65 overexpression protects against necrotic cell death during cellular Ca2&#43; stress. Collectively, our results show that loss of TMEM65 function in excitable tissue disrupts NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux, causing pathogenic mCa2&#43; overload, cell death and organ-level dysfunction, and that gain of TMEM65 function mitigates these effects. These findings demonstrate the essential role of TMEM65 in regulating NCLX-dependent mCa2&#43; efflux and suggest modulation of TMEM65 as a novel strategy for the therapeutic control of mCa2&#43; homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65) depletion in a patient carrying a homozygous variant in the Tmem65 splice site resulted in severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy1, indicating the clinical importance of TMEM65. However, the function of TMEM65 remains unknown. Here, we generated a TMEM65 reporter mouse as well as whole-body and tissue-specific Tmem65 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the localization and function of TMEM65. We show that TMEM65 is localized to mitochondria in heart, skeletal muscle, and throughout the brain. Both whole-body and nervous system-specific Tmem65 KO result in severe growth retardation and sudden death following seizures ~3 weeks after birth, indicating TMEM65 is indispensable for normal brain function. In addition, we find that skeletal muscle-specific Tmem65 KO leads to progressive, adult-onset myopathy preceded by elevated mitochondrial calcium levels despite unaltered expression of known mitochondrial or cellular calcium handling proteins. Consistently, we demonstrate that ablation of TMEM65 results in a loss of sodium-dependent mitochondrial calcium export. Finally, we show that blocking mitochondrial calcium entry through removal of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) rescues the early lethality of whole-body TMEM65 ablation. Our data not only reveal the essential role of TMEM65 in mammalian physiology, but also suggest modulating mitochondrial calcium may offer a potential therapeutical approach to address defects associated with TMEM65 misexpression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes.

Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both.

We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence.

Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages.

Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Alstrom Syndrome (AS), a multi-system disease caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, includes obesity with disproportionately severe insulin resistant diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hepatosteatosis. How loss of ALMS1 causes this phenotype is poorly understood, but prior studies have circumstancially implicated impaired adipose tissue expandability. We set out to test this by comparing the metabolic effects of selective Alms1 knockout in mesenchymal cells including preadipocytes to those of global Alms1 knockout. Methods: Global Alms1 knockout (KO) mice were generated by crossing floxed Alms1 and CAG-Cre mice. A Pdgfr-Cre driver was used to abrogate Alms1 function selectively in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their descendants, including preadipocytes. We combined metabolic phenotyping of global and Pdgfr&#43; Alms1-KO mice on a 45% fat diet with measurements of body composition and food intake, and histological analysis of metabolic tissues. Results: Global Alms1 KO caused hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and fatty liver. Pdgfr-cre driven KO of Alms1 (MSC KO) recapitulated insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidaemia in both sexes. Other phenotypes were sexually dimorphic: increased fat mass was only present in female Alms1 MSC KO mice. Hyperphagia was not evident in male Alms1 MSC KO mice, but was found in MSC KO females, despite no neuronal Pdgfr expression. Conclusions: Mesenchymal deletion of Alms1 recapitulates the metabolic features of AS, including severe fatty liver. This confirms a key role for Alms1 in the adipose lineage, where its loss is sufficient to cause systemic metabolic effects and damage to remote organs. AS should be regarded as a forme fruste of lipodystrophy. Therapies should prioritise targeting positive energy balance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Denervated myofibers and senescent cells are hallmarks of skeletal muscle aging. However, sparse research has examined how resistance training affects these outcomes. We investigated the effects of unilateral leg extensor resistance training on denervated myofibers, senescent cells, and associated protein markers in middle-aged participants (MA, 55{&#43;/-}8 years old, 17 females, 9 males). We obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA), VL biopsies, and strength assessments before and after training. Fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), satellite cells (Pax7&#43;), denervated myofibers (NCAM&#43;), senescent cells (p16&#43; or p21&#43;), senescence-related proteins, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins were analyzed from biopsied muscle. Leg extensor peak torque increased after training (p&lt;0.001), while VL mCSA trended upward (p=0.082). No significant changes were observed for fCSA, NCAM&#43; myofibers, or senescent (p16&#43; or p21&#43;) cells, albeit satellite cells increased after training (p=0.037). While &gt;90% satellite cells were not p16&#43; or p21&#43;, most p16&#43; and p21&#43; cells were Pax7&#43; (&gt;90% on average). Training altered 13/46 proteins related to muscle-nerve communication (all upregulated, p&lt;0.05) and 10/19 proteins related to cellular senescence (9 upregulated, p&lt;0.05). Only 1/17 SASP proteins increased with training (IGFBP-3, p=0.031). In conclusion, resistance training upregulates proteins associated with muscle-nerve communication in MA participants but does not alter NCAM&#43; myofibers. Moreover, while training increases senescence-related proteins in skeletal muscle, this coincided with an increase in satellite cells but not alterations in senescent cell content or SASP proteins. Hence, we interpret these collective findings as resistance training being an unlikely inducer of cellular senescence in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Balancing intense training with adequate recovery is key for optimal athlete performance. While insufficient or excessive training can adversely impact performance, advancements in wearable technology facilitate more effective monitoring of training and readiness level. This study combined data from Garmin watches and a 9-item questionnaire (Readiness Advisor) application to evaluate the readiness during a 39-day long training period. Two groups were studied: one with daily adaptive modifications of the training according to their readiness level and another with a static regimen where no changes were made regardless of readiness level. Results indicated that the adaptive group maintained a more consistent readiness score and showed improved physiological responses and better performance metrics. In contrast, the static group displayed non-significant improvements. This suggests that adaptive training plans, driven by individualized data and AI analytics, can significantly enhance performance outcomes and physiological adaptations for runners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Maternal nutritional status can affect development and metabolic phenotypes of their progeny in animals. The effects of maternal diet are thought to be mediated mainly by changes inside oocytes such as organelles, maternal RNAs, and metabolites. However, to what extent each factor contributes to offspring phenotypes remains uncertain, especially in viviparous mammalian systems, where factors other than oocytes, such as placenta and milk, need to be considered. Here, using the medaka fish as an oviparous vertebrate model, we examined whether maternal high-fat diet (mHFD) feeding affects offspring development, and what kind of changes occur in the contents of mature eggs. We found that mHFD caused the high frequency of embryonic deformities of offspring, accompanied by downregulation of transcription- and translation-related genes and zygotic transcripts at the blastula stage. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of mature eggs suggested decreased catabolism of amino acids and glycogen, moderate upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, and elevated lipid levels in mHFD eggs. Furthermore, HFD females showed upregulation of follicle-stimulating hormone, a higher incidence of oocyte atresia and downregulation of egg protein genes in the liver. These data suggested that attenuated amino acid catabolism triggered by decreased yolk protein load/processing, as well as elevated lipid levels inside eggs, are the prime candidates that account for the higher incidence of embryonic deformities in mHFD offspring. Our study presents a comprehensive data on the changes inside eggs in mHFD model of non-mammalian vertebrates, and provides insights into the mechanisms of parental nutritional effects on their offspring.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, caused by the rupture or erosion of unstable atherosclerotic plaques are the leading cause of death worldwide1. Unfortunately, the lack of a mouse model that develops advanced coronary atherosclerosis and that exhibits a high incidence of spontaneous plaque rupture with MI or stroke has greatly stymied development of more effective therapeutic approaches for reducing these events beyond what has been achieved with aggressive lipid lowering. Herein, we describe a novel mouse model that develops widespread advanced atherosclerosis including in coronary, brachiocephalic, and carotid arteries. These mice show high mortality following Western Diet feeding with clear evidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. To validate the utility of this model, mice were treated with the drug candidate AZM198, which inhibits myeloperoxidase, an enzyme primarily produced by activated neutrophils and predictive of rupture of human atherosclerotic lesions2-7. AZM198 treatment resulted in marked improvements in survival with a greater than 60% decrease in the incidence of plaque rupture, MI, and stroke. In summary, our work describes a novel mouse model that closely replicates late-stage clinical events of advanced human atherosclerotic disease and evidence that this model can be used to identify and test potential new therapeutic agents to prevent major adverse cardiac events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recovery period from post-COVID-19 smell and taste dysfunctions varies substantially, lasting from a few days to over a year. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on post-COVID-19 chemosensory sensitivity in a group of young convalescents of eastern/central European ancestry. We measured subjects smell and taste capabilities with a standard testing kit, Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ), and collected surveys on COVID-19 history. During testing, subjects rated liking and intensity of six odor samples (galaxolide, guaiacol, beta-ionone, trimethylamine, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl fenchol) and six taste samples (sucralose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthiocarbamide, menthol, capsaicin) on a scale from 1 (dislike extremely, or no intensity) to 9 (like extremely, or extremely intense). There was no statistical difference in intensity ratings or liking of any sample between subjects who reported a history of COVID-19 (n = 34) and those reporting no history (n = 40), independent of presence/absence or severity of smell/taste impairments (P &gt; 0.05). Additionally, neither vaccination status (full vaccination or no vaccination) nor time from the COVID-19 onset (2-27 months) correlated with liking or intensity. These results suggest that most young adults who had COVID-19 recovered their sense of smell and taste.</p>
