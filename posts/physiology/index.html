This work investigates the potential for autonomic markers to track the effects of psychedelics -- potent psychoactive drugs with important scientific and clinical value. For this purpose, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to estimate the entropy of heart rate dynamics under psychedelics. We also calculate Bayesian estimates of mean heart rate and heart rate variability, and investigate how these measures relate to subjective reports and neural effects. Results on datasets covering four drugs -- lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and sub-anaesthetic doses of the dissociative agent ketamine -- show consistent increases in mean heart rate, high-frequency heart rate variability, and heart rate entropy during the psychedelic experience. Moreover, these effects have predictive power over various dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Changes in heart rate entropy were found to be correlated with increases in brain entropy, while other autonomic markers were not. Overall, our results show that a cost-efficient autonomic measure has the potential to reveal surprising detail about subjective and brain states, opening up a range of new research avenues to explore in both basic and clinical neuroscience.\nQuantification of healthspan in aging mice: Introducing FAMY and GRAIL\nAuthors: Lamming, D. W.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566044\nThe population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.\nPhysiology of the Weight Loss Plateau after Calorie Restriction, GLP-1 Receptor Agonism, and Bariatric Surgery\nAuthors: Hall, K. D.\nScore: 49.8, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565699\nObjectiveTo investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus. MethodsA validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite. ResultsRYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau. ConclusionsThese preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.\nComparison of radiography and computed tomography for condylar fracture risk assessment in Thoroughbred racehorses\nAuthors: Irandoust, S.; O'Neil, L. M.; Stevenson, C. M.; Franseen, F. M.; Ramzan, P. H. L.; Powell, S. E.; Brounts, S. H.; Loeber, S. J.; Ergun, D. L.; Whitton, R. C.; Henak, C. R.; Muir, P.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566089\nBackgroundCatastrophic injury has a low incidence but leads to the death of many Thoroughbred racehorses annually. Effective screening for injury risk needs to solve the false negative diagnostic sensitivity problem. ObjectivesTo determine sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for condylar stress fracture risk assessment from fetlock digital radiographs (DR) and standing computed tomography (sCT) imaging (Asto CT Equina(R)). Study designControlled ex vivo experiment. MethodsA blinded set of DR and sCT images of the thoracic limb fetlock were prepared from 31 Thoroughbred racehorses and reviewed by four veterinarians. Observers evaluated the condyles and parasagittal grooves (PSG) of the third metacarpal subchondral bone (MC3) for the extent of dense bone and lucency/fissure and assigned a risk assessment grade for condylar stress fracture based on imaging findings. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of subchondral structural changes in the condyles and PSG of the third metacarpal bone and for risk assessment for condylar stress fracture were determined by comparison with a reference assessment. Agreement between each observer and the reference assessment and reliability between observers were determined. Intra-observer repeatability was also assessed. ResultsIntra-observer repeatability was identified for both DR and sCT imaging. Sensitivity for detection of structural change was lower than specificity for both imaging methods and all observers. For horses with a normal level of risk, observer assessment often agreed with the reference assessment. Sensitivity for risk assessment was lower than specificity for all observers. For horses with a high risk of serious injury, observers generally underestimated the level of risk. Diagnostic sensitivity of risk assessment was improved with sCT imaging, particularly for horses with elevated risk of injury. Assessment reliability was better with sCT than DR. Main limitationsThe ex vivo study design influenced DR image sets regarding limb positioning and image contrast compared with in vivo DR imaging. ConclusionsRisk assessment through screening with diagnostic imaging is a promising approach to improve injury prevention in racing Thoroughbreds. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity of fetlock lesion detection by DR and sCT provides critical guidance regarding development of improved screening programs for racehorses using diagnostic imaging. We found improved detection of MC3 subchondral structural change and risk assessment for condylar stress fracture with sCT ex vivo.\nAge-related blunting of serial sarcomerogenesis and mechanical adaptations following 2 weeks of maximal eccentric resistance training\nAuthors: Hinks, A.; Patterson, M. A.; Njai, B. S.; Power, G. A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566004\nBackgroundDuring natural aging, muscles atrophy, which is partly accounted for by a loss of sarcomeres in series. Serial sarcomere number (SSN) is associated with aspects of muscle mechanical function including the force-length and force-velocity-power relationships; hence, the age-related loss of SSN contributes to declining performance. Training emphasizing muscle lengthening (eccentric) contractions increases SSN in young healthy rodents. However, the ability for eccentric training to increase SSN and improve mechanical function in old age is unknown. MethodsTen young (9 months) and 11 old (33 months) Fisher344/BN F1 rats completed 4 weeks of unilateral isokinetic eccentric plantar flexion training 3 days/week. Pre- and post-training, the plantar flexors were assessed for maximum tetanic torque (ankle angles of 70{degrees} and 90{degrees}), the torque-frequency relationship (stimulation frequencies of 1-100 Hz), the passive torque-angle relationship (ankle angles of 110-70{degrees}), and the torque-angular velocity-power relationship (isotonic loads of 10%-80% maximum). Following post-training testing, rats were sacrificed, and the soleus, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) were harvested for SSN assessment by measuring sarcomere lengths with laser diffraction, with the untrained leg used as a control. ResultsIn the untrained leg/pre-training, old rats had lower SSN in the soleus (-9%), LG (-7%), and MG (-14%), lower maximum torque (-27 to -42%), power (-63%), and shortening velocity (-35%), and greater passive torque (+62 to +191%) than young. Young rats showed increased SSN from the untrained to the trained soleus and MG. In contrast, old rats had no change in soleus SSN between legs and experienced SSN loss in the LG. Pre- to post-training, young rats saw modest improvements in isometric mechanical function, including a 13% increase in maximum torque at 90{degrees} and 4-11% increases in 10-60 Hz torque. Old rats, however, had reductions in maximum torque (-35%), shortening velocity (-46%), and power (-63%), and increased passive torque (+24 to +51%) from pre- to post-training. ConclusionsEccentric training induced serial sarcomerogenesis and improved mechanical function in young rats, while old rats exhibited dysfunctional remodeling that led to impairments in muscle mechanical performance following training.\nHigh-resolution glucose tracing and in situ imaging reveals regulated lactate production in human pancreatic β cells\nAuthors: Cuozzo, F.; Viloria, K.; Shilleh, A. H.; Nasteska, D.; Frazer-Morris, C.; Jiao, Z.; Boufersaoui, A.; Marzullo, B.; Smith, H. R.; Bonner, C.; Kerr-Conte, J.; Pattou, F.; Nano, R.; Piemonti, L.; Johnson, P. R.; Spiers, R.; Roberts, J.; Lavery, G. G.; Clark, A.; Ceresa, C. D.; Hodson, L.; Davies, A. P.; Rutter, G.; Oshima, M.; Scharfmann, R.; Merrins, M. J.; Akerman, I.; Tennant, D. A.; Ludwig, C.; Hodson, D. J.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.21.521364\nUsing 13C6 glucose labeling coupled to GC-MS and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we have obtained a comparative high-resolution map of glucose fate underpinning {beta} cell function. In both mouse and human islets, the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle is similar. Pyruvate-fueling of the TCA cycle is primarily mediated by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, with lower flux through pyruvate carboxylase. While conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in islets of both species, lactate accumulation is six-fold higher in human islets. Human islets express LDH, with low-moderate LDHA expression and {beta} cell-specific LDHB expression. LDHB inhibition increases glucose-dependent lactate generation in mouse and human {beta} cells, and decreases Ca2+-spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP levels. Thus, we show that LDHB limits glucose-stimulated lactate generation in {beta} cells. Further studies are warranted to understand how lactate impacts {beta} cell metabolism and/or function. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman and rodent islets generate lactate following glucose stimulation. C_LIO_LI{beta} cells specifically express LDHB, which acts to limit lactate generation. C_LIO_LILDHB inhibition influences Ca2+ spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP ratio. C_LI eTOCCuozzo et al show that glucose-stimulated rodent and human islets generate lactate. Transcriptomic and imaging analyses reveal that LDHB is specifically expressed in {beta} cells and unexpectedly restrains lactate production. LDHB expression and thus regulated lactate generation might reflect a key mechanism underlying {beta} cell metabolism, function and survival.\nRenal mechanotransduction is an essential regulator of renin\nAuthors: Hill, R. Z.; Shirvan, S.; Burquez, S.; Dubin, A. E.; Servin Vences, M. R.; Miner, J. H.; Patapoutian, A.\nScore: 164.0, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.565646\nThe kidneys tightly control the composition of our internal environment to maintain homeostasis in the face of external variability. The regulation of blood volume begins in the kidneys and is essential for vertebrate life in terrestrial environments where salt and water availability are unpredictable1,2. Renin synthesis and release by juxtaglomerular granular cells of the kidney is the rate-limiting step in a hormonal cascade that modulates blood volume, filtration, and salt balance2. Renin is stimulated during hypovolemia and salt deprivation in response to chemical cues released from sympathetic efferent neurons and the macula densa onto the juxtaglomerular granular cells. Renin levels are also proposed to be modulated by mechanical forces elicited by changes in blood volume and/or pressure exerted upon juxtaglomerular cells2-4. However, the identity and significance of the juxtaglomerular mechanotransducer(s) was unknown. We found that the force-gated ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in juxtaglomerular granular cells and in neighboring mesangial cells. Selective genetic ablation of PIEZO2 dysregulated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by elevating renin, raising systemic blood pressure, inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, and exaggerating the hormonal response to volume depletion. These findings demonstrate that PIEZO2 contributes to renal blood volume sensing and kidney function in vivo.\nTitin-based force regulates cardiac myofilament structures mediating length-dependent activation\nAuthors: Hessel, A. L.; Kuehn, M. N.; Engels, N. M.; Nissen, D. L.; Freundt, J. K.; Ma, W.; Irving, T. C.; Linke, W. A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566413\nThe Frank-Starling law states that the heart's stroke volume increases with greater preload due to increased venous return, allowing the heart to adapt to varying circulatory demands. Molecularly, increasing preload increases sarcomere length (SL), which alters sarcomere structures that are correlated to increased calcium sensitivity upon activation. The titin protein, spanning the half-sarcomere, acts as a spring in the I-band, applying a SL-dependent force suggested to pull against and alter myofilaments in a way that supports the Frank-Starling effect. To evaluate this, we employed the titin cleavage (TC) model, where a tobacco-etch virus protease recognition site is inserted into distal I-band titin and allows for rapid, specific cleavage of titin in an otherwise-healthy sarcomere. Here, we evaluated the atomic-level structures of amyopathic cardiac myofilaments following 50% titin cleavage under passive stretch conditions using small-angle X-ray diffraction, which measures these structures under near-physiological (functional) conditions. We report that titin-based forces in permeabilized papillary muscle regulate both thick and thin myofilament structures clearly supporting titin's role in the Frank-Starling mechanism.\nHigh-fat diets promote peritoneal inflammation and augment endometriosis-associated abdominal hyperalgesia\nAuthors: Herup-Wheeler, T.; Shi, M.; Harvey, M. E.; Talwar, C.; Kommagani, R.; MacLean, J. A.; Hayashi, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566474\nImmune dysfunction is one of the central components in the development and progression of endometriosis by establishing a chronic inflammatory environment. Western-style high-fat diets (HFD) have been linked to greater systemic inflammation to cause metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases, and are also considered an environmental risk factor for gynecologic diseases. Here, we aimed to examine how HFD alter an inflammatory environment in endometriosis and discern their contribution to endometriotic-associated hyperalgesia. Our results showed that HFD-induced obesity enhanced abdominal mechanical allodynia that was induced by endometriotic lesions. Peritoneal inflammatory macrophages and cytokine levels increased by lesion induction were elevated by chronic exposure to HFD. Pain-related mediators in the dorsal root ganglia were further stimulated after lesion induction under the HFD condition. Although HFD did not affect inflammatory macrophages in the peritoneal cavity without lesion induction, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were clearly altered by HFD as a sign of low-grade systemic inflammation. Thus, HFD alone might not establish a local inflammatory environment in the pelvic cavity, but it can contribute to further enhancing chronic inflammation, leading to the exacerbation of endometriosis-associated abdominal hyperalgesia following the establishment and progression of the disease.\nObesogenic diet in mice leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the mother in association with sex-specific changes in fetal development, inflammatory markers and placental transcriptome\nAuthors: Candia, A.; Lean, S.; Zhang, C.; McKeating, D.; Cochrane, A.; Gulacsi, E.; Herrera, E.; Krause, B.; Sferruzzi-Perri, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566388\nIntroduction: Obesity during pregnancy is related to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Factors involved in these outcomes may include increased maternal insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress and nutrient mishandling. The placenta is the primary determinant of fetal outcomes, and its function can be impacted by maternal obesity. The aim of this study in mice was to determine the effect of obesity on maternal lipid handling, inflammatory and redox state, and placental oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and gene expression relative to female and male fetal growth. Methods: Female mice were fed control or obesogenic high-fat/high-sugar diet (HFHS) from 9 weeks prior to and during pregnancy. On day 18.5 of pregnancy, maternal plasma, and liver, placenta, and fetal serum were collected to examine the immune and redox state. The placental labyrinth zone (Lz) was dissected for RNA-sequencing analysis of gene expression changes. Results: HFHS diet induced, in the dams, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress (reduced catalase, elevated protein oxidation) and activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (p38-MAPK) along with imbalanced circulating cytokine concentrations (increased IL-6 and decreased IL-5 and IL-17A). HFHS fetuses were asymmetrically growth-restricted, showing sex-specific changes in circulating cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-A;, IL-6 and IFN-G). Morphology of the placenta Lz was modified by a HFHS diet, in association with sex-specific alterations in the expression of genes and proteins implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, and stress signaling. Placental gene expression changes were comparable to that seen in models of intrauterine inflammation and were related to a transcriptional network involving transcription factors, LYL1 and PLAG1. Discussion: This study shows that fetal growth restriction with maternal obesity is related to elevated oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways, and sex-specific placental changes. Our data are important given the marked consequences and the rising rates of obesity worldwide.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A growing body of work shows that autonomic signals provide a privileged evidence-stream to capture various aspects of subjective and neural states. This work investigates the potential for autonomic markers to track the effects of psychedelics -- potent psychoactive drugs with important scientific and clinical value. For this purpose, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to estimate the entropy of heart rate dynamics under psychedelics. We also calculate Bayesian estimates of mean heart rate and heart rate variability, and investigate how these measures relate to subjective reports and neural effects. Results on datasets covering four drugs -- lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and sub-anaesthetic doses of the dissociative agent ketamine -- show consistent increases in mean heart rate, high-frequency heart rate variability, and heart rate entropy during the psychedelic experience. Moreover, these effects have predictive power over various dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Changes in heart rate entropy were found to be correlated with increases in brain entropy, while other autonomic markers were not. Overall, our results show that a cost-efficient autonomic measure has the potential to reveal surprising detail about subjective and brain states, opening up a range of new research avenues to explore in both basic and clinical neuroscience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo investigate why different weight loss interventions result in varying durations of weight loss prior to approaching plateaus.

MethodsA validated mathematical model of energy balance and body composition dynamics was used to simulate mean weight loss trajectories in response to intensive calorie restriction, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 mg, and Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery interventions. Each intervention was simulated by varying two model parameters affecting energy intake to fit the observed mean weight loss data. One parameter represented the persistent magnitude of the intervention to shift the system from baseline equilibrium and the other parameter represented the strength of the feedback control circuit relating weight loss to increased appetite.

ResultsRYGB surgery resulted in a persistent intervention magnitude more than 4-fold greater than calorie restriction and about double that of tirzepatide and semaglutide. All interventions except calorie restriction substantially weakened the appetite feedback control circuit resulting in an extended period of weight loss prior to the plateau.

ConclusionsThese preliminary mathematical modeling results suggest that both GLP-1 receptor agonism and RYGB surgery interventions act to weaken the appetite feedback control circuit regulating body weight and induce greater persistent effects to shift the body weight equilibrium as compared to intensive calorie restriction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCatastrophic injury has a low incidence but leads to the death of many Thoroughbred racehorses annually. Effective screening for injury risk needs to solve the false negative diagnostic sensitivity problem.

ObjectivesTo determine sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for condylar stress fracture risk assessment from fetlock digital radiographs (DR) and standing computed tomography (sCT) imaging (Asto CT Equina(R)).

Study designControlled ex vivo experiment.

MethodsA blinded set of DR and sCT images of the thoracic limb fetlock were prepared from 31 Thoroughbred racehorses and reviewed by four veterinarians. Observers evaluated the condyles and parasagittal grooves (PSG) of the third metacarpal subchondral bone (MC3) for the extent of dense bone and lucency/fissure and assigned a risk assessment grade for condylar stress fracture based on imaging findings. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of subchondral structural changes in the condyles and PSG of the third metacarpal bone and for risk assessment for condylar stress fracture were determined by comparison with a reference assessment. Agreement between each observer and the reference assessment and reliability between observers were determined. Intra-observer repeatability was also assessed.

ResultsIntra-observer repeatability was identified for both DR and sCT imaging. Sensitivity for detection of structural change was lower than specificity for both imaging methods and all observers. For horses with a normal level of risk, observer assessment often agreed with the reference assessment. Sensitivity for risk assessment was lower than specificity for all observers. For horses with a high risk of serious injury, observers generally underestimated the level of risk. Diagnostic sensitivity of risk assessment was improved with sCT imaging, particularly for horses with elevated risk of injury. Assessment reliability was better with sCT than DR.

Main limitationsThe ex vivo study design influenced DR image sets regarding limb positioning and image contrast compared with in vivo DR imaging.

ConclusionsRisk assessment through screening with diagnostic imaging is a promising approach to improve injury prevention in racing Thoroughbreds. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity of fetlock lesion detection by DR and sCT provides critical guidance regarding development of improved screening programs for racehorses using diagnostic imaging. We found improved detection of MC3 subchondral structural change and risk assessment for condylar stress fracture with sCT ex vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring natural aging, muscles atrophy, which is partly accounted for by a loss of sarcomeres in series. Serial sarcomere number (SSN) is associated with aspects of muscle mechanical function including the force-length and force-velocity-power relationships; hence, the age-related loss of SSN contributes to declining performance. Training emphasizing muscle lengthening (eccentric) contractions increases SSN in young healthy rodents. However, the ability for eccentric training to increase SSN and improve mechanical function in old age is unknown.

MethodsTen young (9 months) and 11 old (33 months) Fisher344/BN F1 rats completed 4 weeks of unilateral isokinetic eccentric plantar flexion training 3 days/week. Pre- and post-training, the plantar flexors were assessed for maximum tetanic torque (ankle angles of 70{degrees} and 90{degrees}), the torque-frequency relationship (stimulation frequencies of 1-100 Hz), the passive torque-angle relationship (ankle angles of 110-70{degrees}), and the torque-angular velocity-power relationship (isotonic loads of 10%-80% maximum). Following post-training testing, rats were sacrificed, and the soleus, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) were harvested for SSN assessment by measuring sarcomere lengths with laser diffraction, with the untrained leg used as a control.

ResultsIn the untrained leg/pre-training, old rats had lower SSN in the soleus (-9%), LG (-7%), and MG (-14%), lower maximum torque (-27 to -42%), power (-63%), and shortening velocity (-35%), and greater passive torque (&#43;62 to &#43;191%) than young. Young rats showed increased SSN from the untrained to the trained soleus and MG. In contrast, old rats had no change in soleus SSN between legs and experienced SSN loss in the LG. Pre- to post-training, young rats saw modest improvements in isometric mechanical function, including a 13% increase in maximum torque at 90{degrees} and 4-11% increases in 10-60 Hz torque. Old rats, however, had reductions in maximum torque (-35%), shortening velocity (-46%), and power (-63%), and increased passive torque (&#43;24 to &#43;51%) from pre- to post-training.

ConclusionsEccentric training induced serial sarcomerogenesis and improved mechanical function in young rats, while old rats exhibited dysfunctional remodeling that led to impairments in muscle mechanical performance following training.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Using 13C6 glucose labeling coupled to GC-MS and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, we have obtained a comparative high-resolution map of glucose fate underpinning {beta} cell function. In both mouse and human islets, the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle is similar. Pyruvate-fueling of the TCA cycle is primarily mediated by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, with lower flux through pyruvate carboxylase. While conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in islets of both species, lactate accumulation is six-fold higher in human islets. Human islets express LDH, with low-moderate LDHA expression and {beta} cell-specific LDHB expression. LDHB inhibition increases glucose-dependent lactate generation in mouse and human {beta} cells, and decreases Ca2&#43;-spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP levels. Thus, we show that LDHB limits glucose-stimulated lactate generation in {beta} cells. Further studies are warranted to understand how lactate impacts {beta} cell metabolism and/or function.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman and rodent islets generate lactate following glucose stimulation.
C_LIO_LI{beta} cells specifically express LDHB, which acts to limit lactate generation.
C_LIO_LILDHB inhibition influences Ca2&#43; spiking frequency without affecting ATP/ADP ratio.
C_LI

eTOCCuozzo et al show that glucose-stimulated rodent and human islets generate lactate. Transcriptomic and imaging analyses reveal that LDHB is specifically expressed in {beta} cells and unexpectedly restrains lactate production. LDHB expression and thus regulated lactate generation might reflect a key mechanism underlying {beta} cell metabolism, function and survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The kidneys tightly control the composition of our internal environment to maintain homeostasis in the face of external variability. The regulation of blood volume begins in the kidneys and is essential for vertebrate life in terrestrial environments where salt and water availability are unpredictable1,2. Renin synthesis and release by juxtaglomerular granular cells of the kidney is the rate-limiting step in a hormonal cascade that modulates blood volume, filtration, and salt balance2. Renin is stimulated during hypovolemia and salt deprivation in response to chemical cues released from sympathetic efferent neurons and the macula densa onto the juxtaglomerular granular cells. Renin levels are also proposed to be modulated by mechanical forces elicited by changes in blood volume and/or pressure exerted upon juxtaglomerular cells2-4. However, the identity and significance of the juxtaglomerular mechanotransducer(s) was unknown. We found that the force-gated ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in juxtaglomerular granular cells and in neighboring mesangial cells. Selective genetic ablation of PIEZO2 dysregulated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by elevating renin, raising systemic blood pressure, inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, and exaggerating the hormonal response to volume depletion. These findings demonstrate that PIEZO2 contributes to renal blood volume sensing and kidney function in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Frank-Starling law states that the heart&#39;s stroke volume increases with greater preload due to increased venous return, allowing the heart to adapt to varying circulatory demands. Molecularly, increasing preload increases sarcomere length (SL), which alters sarcomere structures that are correlated to increased calcium sensitivity upon activation. The titin protein, spanning the half-sarcomere, acts as a spring in the I-band, applying a SL-dependent force suggested to pull against and alter myofilaments in a way that supports the Frank-Starling effect. To evaluate this, we employed the titin cleavage (TC) model, where a tobacco-etch virus protease recognition site is inserted into distal I-band titin and allows for rapid, specific cleavage of titin in an otherwise-healthy sarcomere. Here, we evaluated the atomic-level structures of amyopathic cardiac myofilaments following 50% titin cleavage under passive stretch conditions using small-angle X-ray diffraction, which measures these structures under near-physiological (functional) conditions. We report that titin-based forces in permeabilized papillary muscle regulate both thick and thin myofilament structures clearly supporting titin&#39;s role in the Frank-Starling mechanism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune dysfunction is one of the central components in the development and progression of endometriosis by establishing a chronic inflammatory environment. Western-style high-fat diets (HFD) have been linked to greater systemic inflammation to cause metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases, and are also considered an environmental risk factor for gynecologic diseases. Here, we aimed to examine how HFD alter an inflammatory environment in endometriosis and discern their contribution to endometriotic-associated hyperalgesia. Our results showed that HFD-induced obesity enhanced abdominal mechanical allodynia that was induced by endometriotic lesions. Peritoneal inflammatory macrophages and cytokine levels increased by lesion induction were elevated by chronic exposure to HFD. Pain-related mediators in the dorsal root ganglia were further stimulated after lesion induction under the HFD condition. Although HFD did not affect inflammatory macrophages in the peritoneal cavity without lesion induction, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were clearly altered by HFD as a sign of low-grade systemic inflammation. Thus, HFD alone might not establish a local inflammatory environment in the pelvic cavity, but it can contribute to further enhancing chronic inflammation, leading to the exacerbation of endometriosis-associated abdominal hyperalgesia following the establishment and progression of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Obesity during pregnancy is related to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Factors involved in these outcomes may include increased maternal insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress and nutrient mishandling. The placenta is the primary determinant of fetal outcomes, and its function can be impacted by maternal obesity. The aim of this study in mice was to determine the effect of obesity on maternal lipid handling, inflammatory and redox state, and placental oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and gene expression relative to female and male fetal growth. Methods: Female mice were fed control or obesogenic high-fat/high-sugar diet (HFHS) from 9 weeks prior to and during pregnancy. On day 18.5 of pregnancy, maternal plasma, and liver, placenta, and fetal serum were collected to examine the immune and redox state. The placental labyrinth zone (Lz) was dissected for RNA-sequencing analysis of gene expression changes. Results: HFHS diet induced, in the dams, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress (reduced catalase, elevated protein oxidation) and activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (p38-MAPK) along with imbalanced circulating cytokine concentrations (increased IL-6 and decreased IL-5 and IL-17A). HFHS fetuses were asymmetrically growth-restricted, showing sex-specific changes in circulating cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-A;, IL-6 and IFN-G). Morphology of the placenta Lz was modified by a HFHS diet, in association with sex-specific alterations in the expression of genes and proteins implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, and stress signaling. Placental gene expression changes were comparable to that seen in models of intrauterine inflammation and were related to a transcriptional network involving transcription factors, LYL1 and PLAG1. Discussion: This study shows that fetal growth restriction with maternal obesity is related to elevated oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways, and sex-specific placental changes. Our data are important given the marked consequences and the rising rates of obesity worldwide.</p>
