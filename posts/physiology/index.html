C.; Miller, E. W.\nScore: 35.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561080\nBiological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes. Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both. We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence. Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages. Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.\nMuscle Bmal1 is necessary for normal transcriptomic and metabolomic adaptation to endurance exercise training.\nAuthors: Viggars, M. R.; Berko, H. E.; Gutierrez Monreal, M. A.; Martin, R. A.; Esser, K. A.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562100\nObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined. MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units. ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.\nExceptional longevity of mammalian ovarian and oocyte macromolecules throughout the reproductive lifespan\nAuthors: Bomba-Warczak, E. K.; Velez, K. M.; Zhou, L. T.; Guillermier, C.; Edassery, S.; Steinhauser, M.; Savas, J. N.; Elizabeth Duncan, F.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562852\nThe mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, but aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated the exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, both ovaries and oocytes harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal components, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules might play a critical role in both lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.\nFemale Alms1-deficient mice develop echocardiographic features of adult but not infantile Alström Syndrome cardiomyopathy\nAuthors: McKay, E. J.; Luijten, I.; Thomson, A.; Weng, X.; Gehmlich, K.; Gray, G. A.; Semple, R. K.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562570\nBackground: Alstrom Syndrome (AS), a multisystem disorder caused by biallelic ALMS1 mutations, features major cardiac complications often causing early mortality. These are biphasic, including infantile dilated cardiomyopathy, and distinct adult-onset cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocyte maturation defects, cardiac fibrosis and early atherosclerosis have all been invoked as contributors to heart failure in AS, but their relative importance and inter-relationships are unknown. Methods: Cardiac function of global Alms1 knockout mice was assessed by echocardiography at postnatal day 15 (P15) and at 8 and 23 weeks of age. Echocardiography was also undertaken in female mice with Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 deletion in cardiac fibroblasts and a small proportion of cardiomyocytes. Histological and transcriptional analysis of myocardium at P15 and 24 weeks of age was also performed. Results: Cardiac function was unaltered in knockout mice of both sexes at P15 and 8 weeks of age. At 23 weeks of age female but not male knockout mice showed increased left atrial area, decreased isovolumic relaxation time, and reduced ejection fraction, consistent with early restrictive cardiomyopathy. No histological or transcriptional changes could be identified in myocardium of 23-week old female Alms1 KO mice, however. Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 KO in females did not recapitulate the phenotype of global KO at 23 weeks. Conclusions: Adult female, but not male, Alms1-deficient mice show echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction, consistent with the restrictive cardiomyopathy of AS. The explanation for sexual dimorphism remains unclear, but may involve metabolic or endocrine differences between sexes. No infantile cardiomyopathy was found in this study.\nReassessing the role of foot power in human gait\nAuthors: Yetman, Q.; Welte, L.; Shimizu, A.; Rainbow, M. J.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561917\nThe foot acts as the primary interface to the ground during bipedal locomotion. It absorbs and returns energy over stance as the longitudinal arch deforms and recoils. The term arch recoil evokes the concept that the foots returned energy directly propels the centre of mass forward by lifting the talus. However, recent work has shown that arch recoil does not directly drive the body forward; instead, it lowers and posteriorly tilts the talus, putting it into a more favourable position for upright gait. Here, we aim to supply a kinetic explanation for this mechanism. We applied the unified deformable power approach to highly accurate talus kinematics from biplanar videoradiography and force plate measurements to measure the power absorbed/produced by the foot. We coupled these measurements with a simple mathematical model that allowed us to restrict rotation and linear actuation of the talus caused by the recoil of the arch to demonstrate that positive foot power primarily contributes to posteriorly tilting the talus. This suggests the role of positive foot power during propulsion is to keep the talocrural surface in a more favourable position for upright gait rather than directly propelling the centre of mass forwards. These findings highlight that arch mobility during push-off is critical for allowing the ankle to directly propel the body forward and upward during the propulsive phase of gait.\nExercise Training and Cold Exposure Trigger Distinct Molecular Adaptations to Inguinal White Adipose Tissue\nAuthors: Vamvini, M.; Nigro, P.; Caputo, T.; Stanford, K. I.; Hirshman, M. F.; Middelbeek, R. J. W.; Goodyear, L. J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562635\nExercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating \u003e2,000 proteins but also boosting iWAT's thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.\nEffects of intensified training with insufficient recovery on joint level and single muscle fibre mechanical function: The role of myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity\nAuthors: Roussel, O.; Pignanelli, C.; Hubbard, E.; Coates, A.; Cheng, A.; Burr, J.; Power, G. A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562290\nIntense exercise training with insufficient recovery is associated with reductions in neuromuscular performance. However, it is unclear how single muscle fibre mechanical function and myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity contribute to these impairments. We investigated the effects of overload training on joint-level neuromuscular performance and cellular-level mechanical function. Fourteen athletes (4 female, 10 male) underwent a 3-week intensified training protocol consisting of [~]140% of their regular training hours with three additional high-intensity training sessions per week. Neuromuscular performance of the knee extensors was assessed via maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, electrically evoked twitch contractions, and a force-frequency relationship. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis to assess single fibre mechanical function. Neither MVC force nor twitch parameters were altered following intensified training (all p\u003e0.05), but a rightward shift in the force-frequency curve was observed with a 6-27% reduction in force at low-frequencies (5-20Hz, all p\u003c0.05). In single fibres, maximal force output was not reduced following intensified training, but there was a rightward shift in the force-pCa curve driven by a 6% reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity as indicated by a lower pCa50 value (i.e., higher [Ca2+]) across fibre types (Pre=6.477{+/-}0.157, Post=6.088{+/-}0.480, p\u003c0.05). These data indicate intensified training leads to impaired Ca2+ sensitivity at the single fibre level, which in part explains impaired neuromuscular function at the joint level during lower frequencies of activation. This is an important consideration for athletes, as performance is often assessed at maximal levels of activation, and these underlying impairments in force generation may be less obvious. New \u0026 NoteworthyIntense exercise training with insufficient recovery leads to impaired muscle contractile performance. These impairments often manifest at lower frequencies of muscle stimulation, termed prolonged low-frequency force depression. Impaired myofibrillar calcium sensitivity has been suggested as a potential mechanism of prolonged low-frequency force depression. Our work shows that impaired calcium sensitivity of single muscle fibres coincided with joint level prolonged low-frequency force depression after intense exercise training with insufficient recovery.\nVicious cycle of hemodynamic perturbation and endothelial injury in development and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension\nAuthors: Deng, Y.; Chaudhary, K. R.; Yang, A.; Kesavan, K.; Wang, L.; Chathely, K.; Stewart, D. J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562339\nBackground: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease caused by loss of effective lung microvasculature for which there is no curative treatment. Evidence from preclinical models and human disease-causing genetic mutations point to endothelial cell (EC) injury and apoptosis as a central trigger for the initiation of PAH. However, how EC apoptosis leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and complex arteriolar remodeling is uncertain. Methods: Rats were subjected to SU5416-hypoxia (SUHx) and EC apoptosis, pulmonary vascular remodeling and arterial volume was assessed by immunohistochemistry, histology and microCT, respectively. Left pulmonary artery banding (LPAB) was performed, either 1 week before (prevention) or 5 weeks after SU injection (reversal), to study the effect of hemodynamic offloading. Results: In the SUHx model, EC apoptosis was markedly increased as early as 3 days post-SU, persisting through PAH development, and this was associated with a profound arterial pruning with reduction in lung arterial volume (~80%). LPAB abrogated lung EC apoptosis in the banded left lung and prevented as well as reversed arteriolar pruning. Moreover, in the reversal protocol, removal of the band at 10 weeks resulted in improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics and RV remodeling at 13 weeks. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that perturbed hemodynamic factors triggered by lung microvascular arteriolar loss play a requisite role in perpetuating endothelial injury in experimental PAH, leading to persistent arterial EC injury and disease progression. Importantly, vascular loss, arterial remodeling and PH are reversible once the cycle of perturbed hemodynamics and EC injury is broken by unilateral lung banding.\nPhysiological stress response of koala joeys to visitors\nAuthors: Pahuja, H.; Bee, I.; Bee, A.; Narayan, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561560\nKoala (Phascolarctos cinereus) joey rescues are increasing over the years, and rehabilitation of a joey requires extensive care, close proximity and handling by humans. These novel environments are likely to present a suite of biotic and abiotic stressors during rehabilitation. In this study, we longitudinally monitored the faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of three koala joeys within the context of potential stressors at the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 92 faecal samples were analysed for FCMs using a polyclonal R4866 cortisol enzyme-immunoassay which has been previously validated in koalas. The iterative baseline method was used to establish FCM profiles of all individuals, and to identify significant peaks in FCM concentrations. Visitor events were identified and confirmed as an acute stressor based on the FCM profiles of the koala joeys. All three koala joeys elicited a significant rise in FCM concentrations after each visitor encounter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the acute stress response of koala joeys to visitors. We recommend that visitor encounters be kept to a minimum, and perhaps avoided altogether especially for joeys that are being rehabilitated to be released back into the wild.\nDysphagia as a missing link between post-surgical- and opioid-related pneumonia\nAuthors: Frazure, M.; Greene, C. L.; Iceman, K.; Howland, D. R.; Pitts, T.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562610\nObjective: Postoperative pneumonia remains a common complication of surgery, despite increased attention. The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of routine surgery and post-surgical opioid administration on airway protection risk. Methods: Eight healthy adult cats were evaluated for dysphagia in 2 experiments. 1) In 4 female cats airway protection status was tracked following routine abdominal surgery (spay surgery) plus low-dose opioid administration (buprenorphine 0.015mg/kg, IM, q8-12h; n=5). 2) Using a cross-over design (2 male, 2 female) cats were treated with moderate (0.02mg/kg) or high (0.04mg/kg) dose buprenorphine (IM, q8-12h; n=5) to determine changes in airway protection status or evidence of dysphagia. Results: Airway protection was significantly affected in both experiments, but most severely post-surgically where 75% of the animals exhibited silent aspiration. Conclusion: Oropharyngeal swallow is impaired by the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine, most remarkably in the post-operative setting. These findings have implications for the prevention and management of aspiration pneumonia in vulnerable populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Biological membrane potentials, or voltages, are a central facet of cellular life. Optical methods to visualize cellular membrane voltages with fluorescent indicators are an attractive complement to traditional electrode-based approaches, since imaging methods can be high throughput, less invasive, and provide more spatial resolution than electrodes.

Recently developed fluorescent indicators for voltage largely report changes in membrane voltage by monitoring voltage-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. However, it would be useful to be able to not only monitor changes, but also measure values of membrane potentials. This study discloses a new fluorescent indicator which can address both.

We describe the synthesis of a new sulfonated tetramethyl carborhodamine fluorophore. When this carborhodamine is conjugated with an electron-rich, methoxy (-OMe) containing phenylenevinylene molecular wire, the resulting molecule, CRhOMe, is a voltage-sensitive fluorophore with red/far-red fluorescence.

Using CRhOMe, changes in cellular membrane potential can be read out using fluorescence intensity or lifetime. In fluorescence intensity mode, CRhOMe tracks fast-spiking neuronal action potentials with greater signal-to-noise than state-of-the-art BeRST (another voltage-sensitive fluorophore). CRhOMe can also measure values of membrane potential. The fluorescence lifetime of CRhOMe follows a single exponential decay, substantially improving the quantification of membrane potential values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The combination of red-shifted excitation and emission, mono-exponential decay, and high voltage sensitivity enable fast FLIM recording of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. The ability to both monitor and measure membrane potentials with red light using CRhOMe makes it an important approach for studying biological voltages.

Significance StatementBiological membrane potentials are maintained by all forms of life. In electrically excitable cells, fast changes in membrane potential drive downstream events: neurotransmitter release, contraction, or insulin secretion. The ability to monitor changes in and measure values of cellular membrane potentials is central to a mechanistic understanding of cellular physiology and disease. Traditional modes for measuring membrane potential use electrodes, which are invasive, destructive, low throughput, and ill-suited to interrogate spatial dynamics of membrane potentials. Optical methods to visualize potentials with fluorescent dyes offer a powerful complement to traditional electrode approaches. In this study, we show that a new, red to farred fluorophore can both monitor changes in and measure values of membrane potential in a variety of living systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThe skeletal muscle circadian clock plays a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. Recently, this clock mechanism has been linked to both transcriptional and metabolic responses to acute exercise. However, the contribution of the circadian clock mechanism to the molecular and phenotypic adaptations to exercise training have not been defined.

MethodsInducible skeletal muscle-specific Bmal1-floxed mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce skeletal muscle specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1KO) or given a vehicle. Mice were assigned to normal cage conditions, or 6-weeks of progressive treadmill training. Exercise performance, body composition, and tissue/serum indices of metabolic health were assessed over the timecourse of training. Gastrocnemius muscles were collected 48-hours after their last exercise bout for histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses including RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

ResultsImprovements in exercise workload and maximal performance were comparable between iMSBmal1KO mice and vehicle treated controls after 6-weeks of exercise training. However, exercise training in the absence of Bmal1 was not able to rescue the metabolic phenotype and hyperinsulinemia of the iMSBmal1KO mice, attributed to the continued dysregulation of core clock components and gene expression relating to glucose metabolism. Importantly, a much larger and divergent transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the muscle of iMSBmal1KO mice in comparison to their vehicle treated counterparts. This response included a large compensatory upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle components and oxidative phosphorylation components, including mitochondrial subunits and mitoribosome units.

ConclusionsCollectively, we propose that endurance training requires muscle Bmal1, and the core clock network, to elicit well recognized molecular adaptations. In the absence of Bmal1, exercise training results in a much larger and divergent re-networking of the basal skeletal muscle transcriptome and metabolome. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle Bmal1 is indispensable for the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis, even after a 6-weeks exercise training programme.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, but aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated the exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, both ovaries and oocytes harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal components, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules might play a critical role in both lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Alstrom Syndrome (AS), a multisystem disorder caused by biallelic ALMS1 mutations, features major cardiac complications often causing early mortality. These are biphasic, including infantile dilated cardiomyopathy, and distinct adult-onset cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocyte maturation defects, cardiac fibrosis and early atherosclerosis have all been invoked as contributors to heart failure in AS, but their relative importance and inter-relationships are unknown. Methods: Cardiac function of global Alms1 knockout mice was assessed by echocardiography at postnatal day 15 (P15) and at 8 and 23 weeks of age. Echocardiography was also undertaken in female mice with Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 deletion in cardiac fibroblasts and a small proportion of cardiomyocytes. Histological and transcriptional analysis of myocardium at P15 and 24 weeks of age was also performed. Results: Cardiac function was unaltered in knockout mice of both sexes at P15 and 8 weeks of age. At 23 weeks of age female but not male knockout mice showed increased left atrial area, decreased isovolumic relaxation time, and reduced ejection fraction, consistent with early restrictive cardiomyopathy. No histological or transcriptional changes could be identified in myocardium of 23-week old female Alms1 KO mice, however. Pdgfr-Cre-driven Alms1 KO in females did not recapitulate the phenotype of global KO at 23 weeks. Conclusions: Adult female, but not male, Alms1-deficient mice show echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction, consistent with the restrictive cardiomyopathy of AS. The explanation for sexual dimorphism remains unclear, but may involve metabolic or endocrine differences between sexes. No infantile cardiomyopathy was found in this study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The foot acts as the primary interface to the ground during bipedal locomotion. It absorbs and returns energy over stance as the longitudinal arch deforms and recoils. The term  arch recoil evokes the concept that the foots returned energy directly propels the centre of mass forward by lifting the talus. However, recent work has shown that arch recoil does not directly drive the body forward; instead, it lowers and posteriorly tilts the talus, putting it into a more favourable position for upright gait. Here, we aim to supply a kinetic explanation for this mechanism. We applied the unified deformable power approach to highly accurate talus kinematics from biplanar videoradiography and force plate measurements to measure the power absorbed/produced by the foot. We coupled these measurements with a simple mathematical model that allowed us to restrict rotation and linear actuation of the talus caused by the recoil of the arch to demonstrate that positive foot power primarily contributes to posteriorly tilting the talus. This suggests the role of positive foot power during propulsion is to keep the talocrural surface in a more favourable position for upright gait rather than directly propelling the centre of mass forwards. These findings highlight that arch mobility during push-off is critical for allowing the ankle to directly propel the body forward and upward during the propulsive phase of gait.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise training and cold exposure both improve systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms are not well-established. We tested the hypothesis that adaptations to inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are critical for these beneficial effects by determining the impact of exercise-trained and cold-exposed iWAT on systemic glucose metabolism and the iWAT proteome and secretome. Transplanting trained iWAT into sedentary mice improved glucose tolerance, while cold-exposed iWAT transplantation showed no such benefit. Compared to training, cold led to more pronounced alterations in the iWAT proteome and secretome, downregulating &gt;2,000 proteins but also boosting iWAT&#39;s thermogenic capacity. In contrast, only training increased extracellular space and vesicle transport proteins, and only training upregulated proteins that correlate with favorable fasting glucose, suggesting fundamental changes in trained iWAT that mediate tissue-to-tissue communication. This study defines the unique exercise training- and cold exposure-induced iWAT proteomes, revealing distinct mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these interventions on metabolic health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intense exercise training with insufficient recovery is associated with reductions in neuromuscular performance. However, it is unclear how single muscle fibre mechanical function and myofibrillar Ca2&#43; sensitivity contribute to these impairments. We investigated the effects of overload training on joint-level neuromuscular performance and cellular-level mechanical function. Fourteen athletes (4 female, 10 male) underwent a 3-week intensified training protocol consisting of [~]140% of their regular training hours with three additional high-intensity training sessions per week. Neuromuscular performance of the knee extensors was assessed via maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, electrically evoked twitch contractions, and a force-frequency relationship. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis to assess single fibre mechanical function. Neither MVC force nor twitch parameters were altered following intensified training (all p&gt;0.05), but a rightward shift in the force-frequency curve was observed with a 6-27% reduction in force at low-frequencies (5-20Hz, all p&lt;0.05). In single fibres, maximal force output was not reduced following intensified training, but there was a rightward shift in the force-pCa curve driven by a 6% reduction in Ca2&#43; sensitivity as indicated by a lower pCa50 value (i.e., higher [Ca2&#43;]) across fibre types (Pre=6.477{&#43;/-}0.157, Post=6.088{&#43;/-}0.480, p&lt;0.05). These data indicate intensified training leads to impaired Ca2&#43; sensitivity at the single fibre level, which in part explains impaired neuromuscular function at the joint level during lower frequencies of activation. This is an important consideration for athletes, as performance is often assessed at maximal levels of activation, and these underlying impairments in force generation may be less obvious.

New &amp; NoteworthyIntense exercise training with insufficient recovery leads to impaired muscle contractile performance. These impairments often manifest at lower frequencies of muscle stimulation, termed prolonged low-frequency force depression. Impaired myofibrillar calcium sensitivity has been suggested as a potential mechanism of prolonged low-frequency force depression. Our work shows that impaired calcium sensitivity of single muscle fibres coincided with joint level prolonged low-frequency force depression after intense exercise training with insufficient recovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease caused by loss of effective lung microvasculature for which there is no curative treatment. Evidence from preclinical models and human disease-causing genetic mutations point to endothelial cell (EC) injury and apoptosis as a central trigger for the initiation of PAH. However, how EC apoptosis leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and complex arteriolar remodeling is uncertain. Methods: Rats were subjected to SU5416-hypoxia (SUHx) and EC apoptosis, pulmonary vascular remodeling and arterial volume was assessed by immunohistochemistry, histology and microCT, respectively. Left pulmonary artery banding (LPAB) was performed, either 1 week before (prevention) or 5 weeks after SU injection (reversal), to study the effect of hemodynamic offloading. Results: In the SUHx model, EC apoptosis was markedly increased as early as 3 days post-SU, persisting through PAH development, and this was associated with a profound arterial pruning with reduction in lung arterial volume (~80%). LPAB abrogated lung EC apoptosis in the banded left lung and prevented as well as reversed arteriolar pruning. Moreover, in the reversal protocol, removal of the band at 10 weeks resulted in improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics and RV remodeling at 13 weeks. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that perturbed hemodynamic factors triggered by lung microvascular arteriolar loss play a requisite role in perpetuating endothelial injury in experimental PAH, leading to persistent arterial EC injury and disease progression. Importantly, vascular loss, arterial remodeling and PH are reversible once the cycle of perturbed hemodynamics and EC injury is broken by unilateral lung banding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) joey rescues are increasing over the years, and rehabilitation of a joey requires extensive care, close proximity and handling by humans. These novel environments are likely to present a suite of biotic and abiotic stressors during rehabilitation. In this study, we longitudinally monitored the faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of three koala joeys within the context of potential stressors at the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 92 faecal samples were analysed for FCMs using a polyclonal R4866 cortisol enzyme-immunoassay which has been previously validated in koalas. The iterative baseline method was used to establish FCM profiles of all individuals, and to identify significant peaks in FCM concentrations. Visitor events were identified and confirmed as an acute stressor based on the FCM profiles of the koala joeys. All three koala joeys elicited a significant rise in FCM concentrations after each visitor encounter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the acute stress response of koala joeys to visitors. We recommend that visitor encounters be kept to a minimum, and perhaps avoided altogether especially for joeys that are being rehabilitated to be released back into the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Postoperative pneumonia remains a common complication of surgery, despite increased attention. The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of routine surgery and post-surgical opioid administration on airway protection risk. Methods: Eight healthy adult cats were evaluated for dysphagia in 2 experiments. 1) In 4 female cats airway protection status was tracked following routine abdominal surgery (spay surgery) plus low-dose opioid administration (buprenorphine 0.015mg/kg, IM, q8-12h; n=5). 2) Using a cross-over design (2 male, 2 female) cats were treated with moderate (0.02mg/kg) or high (0.04mg/kg) dose buprenorphine (IM, q8-12h; n=5) to determine changes in airway protection status or evidence of dysphagia. Results: Airway protection was significantly affected in both experiments, but most severely post-surgically where 75% of the animals exhibited silent aspiration. Conclusion: Oropharyngeal swallow is impaired by the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine, most remarkably in the post-operative setting. These findings have implications for the prevention and management of aspiration pneumonia in vulnerable populations.</p>
