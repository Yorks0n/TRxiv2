C.; Nemkov, T.; D'Alessandro, A.; Tennessen, J. M.; Weaver, L. N.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553385\nThe ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.\nPantothenate Kinase 4 controls efficient skeletal muscle energy substrate metabolism via acetyl-CoA\nAuthors: Miranda-Cervantes, A.; Fritzen, A. M.; Raun, S. H.; Hodek, O.; Moller, L. L. V.; Johann, K.; Deisen, L.; Gregorevic, P.; Gudiksen, A.; Artati, A.; Adamski, J.; Andersen, N.

D.; Sylow, L.; Kiens, B.; Richter, E.; Kleinert, M.\nScore: 17.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.551603\nMetabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.\nA neuronal relay mediates muscle-adipose communication that drives systemic metabolic adaptation to high-sugar diets\nAuthors: Kubrak, O.; Joergensen, A. F.; Koyama, T.; Nagy, S.; Lassen, M.; Hald, J.; Madsen, D.; Halberg, K. V.; Texada, M. J.; Hansen, J. L.; Rewitz, K.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553340\nObesity leads to impaired insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity, which drive the onset of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance leads to a reduction in cellular glucose uptake, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels, which consequently cause {beta}-cell dysfunction and development of diabetes. Although improving insulin signaling is a key target for restoring whole-body glucose homeostasis and reversing diabetes, the multi-organ mechanisms that regulate insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity are poorly defined. We screened the secretome and receptome in Drosophila to identify the underlying interorgan hormonal crosstalk affecting diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. We identified complex interplay between muscle, neuronal, and fat tissues, mediated by the conserved BMP and LGR signaling pathways, which augments insulin signaling and improves dietary sugar tolerance. We found that muscle-derived BMP signaling is induced by sugar and governs neuronal Bursicon signaling. Acting through its LGR-family receptor, Bursicon both enhances insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, thereby preventing sugar-induced hyperglycemia. Inhibition of Bursicon-LGR signaling in adipose tissue exacerbates sugar-induced insulin resistance, and we discovered that this condition could be alleviated by suppressing NF-{kappa}B signaling. Our findings identify a muscle-neuronal-fat tissue axis that drives metabolic adaptation to high-sugar conditions by modulating insulin secretion and adipocyte insulin sensitivity, highlighting mechanisms that may be exploited for the development of strategies for the treatment and reversal of insulin resistance.\nPancreatic islet α cell function and proliferation requires the arginine transporter SLC7A2\nAuthors: Spears, E.; Stanley, J.

P.; Chen, W.; Powers, A. C.; Dean, E. D.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552656\nInterrupting glucagon signaling decreases gluconeogenesis and the fractional extraction of amino acids by liver from blood resulting in lower glycemia. The resulting hyperaminoacidemia stimulates cell proliferation and glucagon secretion via a liver- cell axis. We hypothesized that cells detect and respond to circulating amino acids levels via a unique amino acid transporter repertoire. We found that Slc7a2ISLC7A2 is the most highly expressed cationic amino acid transporter in cells with its expression being three-fold greater in than {beta} cells in both mouse and human. Employing cell culture, zebrafish, and knockout mouse models, we found that the cationic amino acid arginine and SLC7A2 are required for cell proliferation in response to interrupted glucagon signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo assessment of islet function in Slc7a2-/- mice showed decreased arginine-stimulated glucagon and insulin secretion. We found that arginine activation of mTOR signaling and induction of the glutamine transporter SLC38A5 was dependent on SLC7A2, showing that boths role in cell proliferation is dependent on arginine transport and SLC7A2. Finally, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC7A2 associated with HbA1c. Together, these data indicate a central role for SLC7A2 in amino acid-stimulated cell proliferation and islet hormone secretion.\nSensory representations and pupil-indexed listening effort provide complementary contributions to multi-talker speech intelligibility\nAuthors: McHaney, J. R.; Hancock, K. E.; Polley, D. B.; Parthasarathy, A.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553131\nOptimal speech perception in noise requires successful separation of the target speech stream from multiple competing background speech streams. The ability to segregate these competing speech streams depends on the fidelity of bottom-up neural representations of sensory information in the auditory system and top-down influences of effortful listening. Here, we use objective neurophysiological measures of bottom-up temporal processing using envelope-following responses (EFRs) to amplitude modulated tones and investigate their interactions with pupil-indexed listening effort, as it relates to performance on the Quick speech in noise (QuickSIN) test in young adult listeners with clinically normal hearing thresholds. We developed an approach using ear-canal electrodes and adjusting electrode montages for modulation rate ranges, which extended the rage of reliable EFR measurements as high as 1024Hz. Pupillary responses revealed changes in listening effort at the two most difficult signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), but behavioral deficits at the hardest SNR only. Neither pupil-indexed listening effort nor the slope of the EFR decay function independently related to QuickSIN performance. However, a linear model using the combination of EFRs and pupil metrics significantly explained variance in QuickSIN performance. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bottom-up sensory coding and top-down measures of listening effort as it relates to speech perception in noise. These findings can inform the development of next-generation tests for hearing deficits in listeners with normal-hearing thresholds that incorporates a multi-dimensional approach to understanding speech intelligibility deficits.\nDifferences in the Pupillary Responses to Evening Light between Children and Adolescents\nAuthors: Hartstein, L. E.; LeBourgeois, M. K.; Durniak, M. T.; Najjar, R. P.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552691\nPurposeTo assess differences in the pupillary light responses (PLRs) to blue and red evening lights between children and adolescents. MethodsForty healthy participants (8-9 years, n=21; 15-16 years, n=19) completed a PLR assessment 1 h before their habitual bedtime. After a 1 h dim-light adaptation period (\u003c1 lux), baseline pupil diameter was measured in darkness for 30 s, followed by a 10 s exposure to 3.0x1013 photons/cm2/s of either red (627 nm) or blue (459 nm) light, and a 40 s recovery in darkness to assess pupillary re-dilation. Subsequently, participants underwent 7 min of dim-light re-adaptation followed by an exposure to the other light condition. Lights were counterbalanced across participants. ResultsAcross both age groups, maximum pupil constriction was significantly greater (p\u003c 0.001, {eta}p2=0.48) and more sustained (p\u003c 0.001, {eta}p2=0.41) during exposure to blue compared to red light. For adolescents, the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR), a hallmark of melanopsin function, was larger after blue compared with red light (p= 0.02, d=0.60). This difference was not observed in children. Across light exposures, children had larger phasic (p\u003c 0.01, {eta}p2=0.20) and maximal (p\u003c 0.01, {eta}p2=0.22) pupil constrictions compared to adolescents. ConclusionsBlue light elicited a greater and more sustained pupillary response than red light across participants. However, the overall amplitude of the rod/cone-driven phasic response was greater in children than in adolescents. Our findings using the PLR highlight a higher sensitivity to evening light in children compared to adolescents, and continued maturation of the human non-visual photoreception/system throughout development.\nThiazolidinediones are partially effective bitter blockers\nAuthors: Nguyen, H.; Lin, C.; Sasimovich, I.; Bell, K.; Huang, A.; Leszkowicz, E.; Rawson, N.; Reed, D. R.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552460\nPurposeThe bad bitter taste of some medicines is a barrier to overcoming non-compliance with medication use, especially life-saving drugs given to children and the elderly. Here we evaluated a new class of bitter blockers (thiazolidinediones; TZDs). MethodsIn this study, two TZDs were tested, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and a simpler form of TZD, using a high-potency sweetener as a positive control (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, NHDC). We tested bitter-blocking effects using the bitter drugs tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), a treatment for HIV and hepatitis B infection, and praziquantel (PRAZ), a treatment for schistosomiasis, by conducting taste testing with two separate taste panels: a general panel (N=97, 20-23 yrs, 82.5% female, all Eastern European) and a genetically informative panel (N=158, including 68 twin pairs, 18-82 yrs, 76% female, 87% European ancestry). Participants rated the bitterness intensity of the solutions on a 100-point generalized visual analog scale. FindingsParticipants in both taste panels rated the bitter drugs TAF and PRAZ as less bitter on average when mixed with NHDC than when sampled alone. ROSI partially suppressed the bitterness of TAF and PRAZ, but effectiveness differed between the two panels: bitterness was significantly reduced for PRAZ but not TAF in the general panel and for TAF but not PRAZ in the genetically informative panel. ROSI was a more effective blocker than the other TZD. ImplicationsThese results suggest that TZDs are partially effective bitter blockers, suggesting other TZDs should be designed and tested with more drugs and on diverse populations to define which ones work best with which drugs and for whom. The discovery of bitter receptor blockers can improve compliance with medication use.\nSex-specific effects of injury and beta-adrenergic activation on metabolic and inflammatory mediators in a murine model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis\nAuthors: Komaravolu, R. K.; Mehta-D'souza, P.; Conner, T.; Allen, M.; Lumry, J.; Griffin, T. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553402\nMetabolic processes are intricately linked to the resolution of innate inflammation and tissue repair, two critical steps for treating post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Here we used the {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) agonist isoproterenol as a tool to perturb intra-articular metabolism 3.5 weeks after applying a non-invasive single-load compression injury to knees of 12-week-old male and female mice. We examined the acute effects of intra-articular treatment with isoproterenol relative to saline on pain behavior, histology, multiplex gene expression, and synovial fluid metabolomics. Injured knees developed PTOA pathology characterized by heterotopic ossification, loss of tibial and femoral articular cartilage, and infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) atrophy and fibrosis. Isoproterenol modestly increased IFP atrophy and fibrosis, and it also caused sexually dimorphic and injury-dependent effects on IFP and synovium gene expression. In injured joints of female mice, isoproterenol suppressed the upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes and downregulated the expression of adipose tissue genes and pro-inflammatory genes (Adam17, Cd14, Icam1, Csf1r, and Casp1). Injury substantially altered synovial fluid metabolites by increasing amino acids, peptides, sphingolipids, phospholipids, bile acids, and dicarboxylic acids, but these changes were not appreciably altered by isoproterenol. Mechanical allodynia was also not altered by isoproterenol, although isoproterenol downregulated the expression of nociception-associated genes, Ngf and Tacr1, in injured IFP-synovium of female mice. Overall, these results suggest that {beta}AR activation functions in a sexually dimorphic manner in PTOA joints. The findings support further exploration of therapeutic strategies that target neuro-metabolic signaling pathways for treating PTOA, particularly in women.\nItaconate stabilizes CPT1a to enhance lipid utilization during inflammation\nAuthors: Mainali, R.; Buechler, N.; Ortero, C.; Edwards, L.; Key, C.-C.; Furdui, C.; Quinn, M. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553243\nOne primary metabolic manifestation of inflammation is the diversion of cis-aconitate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to synthesize the immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing Irg1 knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed at understanding the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, Irg1 KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveal enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-ocytl itaconate (4-OI) treatment in vitro. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate Irg1 KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.\nEffects of shoe heel height on ankle dynamics in running\nAuthors: Yawar, A.; Lieberman, D. E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552471\nShoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity leads to impaired insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity, which drive the onset of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance leads to a reduction in cellular glucose uptake, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels, which consequently cause {beta}-cell dysfunction and development of diabetes. Although improving insulin signaling is a key target for restoring whole-body glucose homeostasis and reversing diabetes, the multi-organ mechanisms that regulate insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity are poorly defined. We screened the secretome and receptome in Drosophila to identify the underlying interorgan hormonal crosstalk affecting diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. We identified complex interplay between muscle, neuronal, and fat tissues, mediated by the conserved BMP and LGR signaling pathways, which augments insulin signaling and improves dietary sugar tolerance. We found that muscle-derived BMP signaling is induced by sugar and governs neuronal Bursicon signaling. Acting through its LGR-family receptor, Bursicon both enhances insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, thereby preventing sugar-induced hyperglycemia. Inhibition of Bursicon-LGR signaling in adipose tissue exacerbates sugar-induced insulin resistance, and we discovered that this condition could be alleviated by suppressing NF-{kappa}B signaling. Our findings identify a muscle-neuronal-fat tissue axis that drives metabolic adaptation to high-sugar conditions by modulating insulin secretion and adipocyte insulin sensitivity, highlighting mechanisms that may be exploited for the development of strategies for the treatment and reversal of insulin resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interrupting glucagon signaling decreases gluconeogenesis and the fractional extraction of amino acids by liver from blood resulting in lower glycemia. The resulting hyperaminoacidemia stimulates  cell proliferation and glucagon secretion via a liver- cell axis. We hypothesized that  cells detect and respond to circulating amino acids levels via a unique amino acid transporter repertoire. We found that Slc7a2ISLC7A2 is the most highly expressed cationic amino acid transporter in  cells with its expression being three-fold greater in  than {beta} cells in both mouse and human. Employing cell culture, zebrafish, and knockout mouse models, we found that the cationic amino acid arginine and SLC7A2 are required for  cell proliferation in response to interrupted glucagon signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo assessment of islet function in Slc7a2-/- mice showed decreased arginine-stimulated glucagon and insulin secretion. We found that arginine activation of mTOR signaling and induction of the glutamine transporter SLC38A5 was dependent on SLC7A2, showing that boths role in  cell proliferation is dependent on arginine transport and SLC7A2. Finally, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC7A2 associated with HbA1c. Together, these data indicate a central role for SLC7A2 in amino acid-stimulated  cell proliferation and islet hormone secretion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Optimal speech perception in noise requires successful separation of the target speech stream from multiple competing background speech streams. The ability to segregate these competing speech streams depends on the fidelity of bottom-up neural representations of sensory information in the auditory system and top-down influences of effortful listening. Here, we use objective neurophysiological measures of bottom-up temporal processing using envelope-following responses (EFRs) to amplitude modulated tones and investigate their interactions with pupil-indexed listening effort, as it relates to performance on the Quick speech in noise (QuickSIN) test in young adult listeners with clinically normal hearing thresholds. We developed an approach using ear-canal electrodes and adjusting electrode montages for modulation rate ranges, which extended the rage of reliable EFR measurements as high as 1024Hz. Pupillary responses revealed changes in listening effort at the two most difficult signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), but behavioral deficits at the hardest SNR only. Neither pupil-indexed listening effort nor the slope of the EFR decay function independently related to QuickSIN performance. However, a linear model using the combination of EFRs and pupil metrics significantly explained variance in QuickSIN performance. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bottom-up sensory coding and top-down measures of listening effort as it relates to speech perception in noise. These findings can inform the development of next-generation tests for hearing deficits in listeners with normal-hearing thresholds that incorporates a multi-dimensional approach to understanding speech intelligibility deficits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeTo assess differences in the pupillary light responses (PLRs) to blue and red evening lights between children and adolescents.

MethodsForty healthy participants (8-9 years, n=21; 15-16 years, n=19) completed a PLR assessment 1 h before their habitual bedtime. After a 1 h dim-light adaptation period (&lt;1 lux), baseline pupil diameter was measured in darkness for 30 s, followed by a 10 s exposure to 3.0x1013 photons/cm2/s of either red (627 nm) or blue (459 nm) light, and a 40 s recovery in darkness to assess pupillary re-dilation. Subsequently, participants underwent 7 min of dim-light re-adaptation followed by an exposure to the other light condition. Lights were counterbalanced across participants.

ResultsAcross both age groups, maximum pupil constriction was significantly greater (p&lt; 0.001, {eta}p2=0.48) and more sustained (p&lt; 0.001, {eta}p2=0.41) during exposure to blue compared to red light. For adolescents, the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR), a hallmark of melanopsin function, was larger after blue compared with red light (p= 0.02, d=0.60). This difference was not observed in children. Across light exposures, children had larger phasic (p&lt; 0.01, {eta}p2=0.20) and maximal (p&lt; 0.01, {eta}p2=0.22) pupil constrictions compared to adolescents.

ConclusionsBlue light elicited a greater and more sustained pupillary response than red light across participants. However, the overall amplitude of the rod/cone-driven phasic response was greater in children than in adolescents. Our findings using the PLR highlight a higher sensitivity to evening light in children compared to adolescents, and continued maturation of the human non-visual photoreception/system throughout development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThe bad bitter taste of some medicines is a barrier to overcoming non-compliance with medication use, especially life-saving drugs given to children and the elderly. Here we evaluated a new class of bitter blockers (thiazolidinediones; TZDs).

MethodsIn this study, two TZDs were tested, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and a simpler form of TZD, using a high-potency sweetener as a positive control (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, NHDC). We tested bitter-blocking effects using the bitter drugs tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), a treatment for HIV and hepatitis B infection, and praziquantel (PRAZ), a treatment for schistosomiasis, by conducting taste testing with two separate taste panels: a general panel (N=97, 20-23 yrs, 82.5% female, all Eastern European) and a genetically informative panel (N=158, including 68 twin pairs, 18-82 yrs, 76% female, 87% European ancestry). Participants rated the bitterness intensity of the solutions on a 100-point generalized visual analog scale.

FindingsParticipants in both taste panels rated the bitter drugs TAF and PRAZ as less bitter on average when mixed with NHDC than when sampled alone. ROSI partially suppressed the bitterness of TAF and PRAZ, but effectiveness differed between the two panels: bitterness was significantly reduced for PRAZ but not TAF in the general panel and for TAF but not PRAZ in the genetically informative panel. ROSI was a more effective blocker than the other TZD.

ImplicationsThese results suggest that TZDs are partially effective bitter blockers, suggesting other TZDs should be designed and tested with more drugs and on diverse populations to define which ones work best with which drugs and for whom. The discovery of bitter receptor blockers can improve compliance with medication use.</p>

Here we used the {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) agonist isoproterenol as a tool to perturb intra-articular metabolism 3.5 weeks after applying a non-invasive single-load compression injury to knees of 12-week-old male and female mice. We examined the acute effects of intra-articular treatment with isoproterenol relative to saline on pain behavior, histology, multiplex gene expression, and synovial fluid metabolomics. Injured knees developed PTOA pathology characterized by heterotopic ossification, loss of tibial and femoral articular cartilage, and infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) atrophy and fibrosis. Isoproterenol modestly increased IFP atrophy and fibrosis, and it also caused sexually dimorphic and injury-dependent effects on IFP and synovium gene expression. In injured joints of female mice, isoproterenol suppressed the upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes and downregulated the expression of adipose tissue genes and pro-inflammatory genes (Adam17, Cd14, Icam1, Csf1r, and Casp1). Injury substantially altered synovial fluid metabolites by increasing amino acids, peptides, sphingolipids, phospholipids, bile acids, and dicarboxylic acids, but these changes were not appreciably altered by isoproterenol. Mechanical allodynia was also not altered by isoproterenol, although isoproterenol downregulated the expression of nociception-associated genes, Ngf and Tacr1, in injured IFP-synovium of female mice. Overall, these results suggest that {beta}AR activation functions in a sexually dimorphic manner in PTOA joints. The findings support further exploration of therapeutic strategies that target neuro-metabolic signaling pathways for treating PTOA, particularly in women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One primary metabolic manifestation of inflammation is the diversion of cis-aconitate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to synthesize the immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing Irg1 knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed at understanding the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, Irg1 KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveal enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-ocytl itaconate (4-OI) treatment in vitro. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate Irg1 KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.</p>
