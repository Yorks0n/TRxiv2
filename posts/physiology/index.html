E.; Soeller, C.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550636\nThe cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2+ enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2+ sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2+ handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.\nThe Endosomal pH Regulator NHE6 is Required for Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake in Adipocytes\nAuthors: Mekile, A. X.; Makena, M. R.; Gupta, R.; White, C. J.; Bowman, R. W.; Patnayak, R. L.; Lorenzo, D. N.; Rao, R.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551163\nObjectiveTrafficking of GLUcose Transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from the adipocyte vesicular pool to the cell surface is tightly regulated by insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to changing demands in energy consumption. Previously, endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6, gene name SLC9A6) was identified in adipocyte plasma membranes and shown to associate with GLUT4-positive vesicles. However, the functional contribution of NHE6 to GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake remained uncharacterized. MethodsNHE6 was knocked down in 3T3L1 cells either before or after differentiation into adipocytes using lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose into adipocytes was quantified in response to insulin. We used epitope tagged constructs to distinguish between localization of vesicular and surface levels of NHE6 and GLUT4 proteins. Protein and transcript levels of components of the glucose signaling pathway were monitored by qPCR and Western analysis, respectively, in response to NHE6 knockdown and/or treatment with chemical modulators of endosomal pH. ResultsWe show that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes is severely impaired upon NHE6 depletion. Correspondingly, insulin-stimulated surface expression of GLUT4 at the adipocyte plasma membrane was diminished in NHE6 knockdown cells due to a post-transcriptional decrease in basal GLUT4. Metformin response of GLUT4 was also muted in the absence of NHE6. Further, we demonstrate diminished activation of the GLUT4 translocation pathway in the absence of NHE6 via reduced expression of the insulin receptor and reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Akt. Components of GLUT4 storage vesicles, including GLUT4, LRP1 and sortilin were downregulated in NHE6-knockdown adipocytes under basal conditions. Proteostatic control of key components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptor, GLUT4) could be restored by chemical bypass of NHE6 using the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or the Na+/H+ exchanger mimetic monensin. ConclusionsThus, NHE6 is critical for proper expression and trafficking of GLUT4. Basal expression of both insulin receptor and GLUT4 in NHE6 knockdown cells could be restored by bafilomycin-inhibition of the H+-ATPase or the H+ ionophore monensin pointing to pH dysregulation as the underlying defect. We suggest that NHE6 is a component of GLUT4 storage vesicles where it regulates proteostasis. These findings establish NHE6 as a novel contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism with implications for Christianson syndrome patients who carry loss of function mutations in the SLC9A6 gene.

Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2+]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection.\nEarly-life stress triggers long-lasting organismal resilience and longevity via tetraspanin\nAuthors: Jiang, W. I.; Belly, H. D.; Wang, B. K.; Wong, A.; Kim, M.; Oh, F.; DeGeorge, J.; Huang, X.; Guang, S.; Weiner, O. K.; Ma, D. K.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550452\nEarly-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.\nGSK3 inhibition improves skeletal muscle function and whole-body metabolism in the severe DBA/2J mdx mouse model\nAuthors: Marcella, B.

A.; Vandenboom, R.; Roy, B. D.; MacNeil, A. J.; MacPherson, R. E.; Fajardo, V.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.16.480726\nIntroductory paragraphDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked muscle wasting disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 males worldwide1. It is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which compromises muscle integrity, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness2. Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for patients with DMD as they delay the loss of ambulation by an average of 3 years3; however, they are also associated with adverse effects such as insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes4. Thus, alternative therapeutic options should be explored. Here, we show that treating the DBA/2J mdx mouse with the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor, tideglusib, improved skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity, while also attenuating the hypermetabolic phenotype previously observed in these mice5. Furthermore, treating mdx mice with the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, augmented the benefits of voluntary wheel running on insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle function despite running half of the total distance compared to control-treated mdx mice. This is important given that some patients with DMD may not be able to engage in adequate amounts of physical activity. Thus, GSK3 inhibition alone or in combination with exercise can enhance skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity in mdx mice.\nExposure to early life stress impairs weight loss maintenance success in mice.\nAuthors: Foright, R. M.; McQuillan, T. E.; Frick, J. M.; Minchella, P. M.; Levasseur, B. M.; Tinoco, O.; Birmingham, L.; Lewis, A. E.; Thyfault, J. P.; Christianson, J. A.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549724\nEarly life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.\nCircadian proteomics reveal rampant tuning of post-transcriptional apparatus by Chlamydomonas clock\nAuthors: Jadhav, D. B.; Roy, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550970\nTiming of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earths rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often dont concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified \u003e1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, \u003e40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and \u003e 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonass unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.\nVhl deletion in Dmp1-expressing cells alters MEP metabolism and promotes stress erythropoiesis\nAuthors: Emery, J. M.; Chicana, B.; Taglinao, H.; Ponce, C.; Donham, C.; Padmore, H.; Sebastian, A.; Trasti, S. L.; Manilay, J. O.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550559\nIn recent years, general hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzyme inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia due to renal disease and osteoporosis. However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis. Key Points* Dysregulation of HIF signaling in Dmp1+ bone cells induces stress erythropoiesis. * Skeletal homeostasis modulates erythropoiesis.\nThe black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis detects CO2 without the Haller's organ\nAuthors: Städele, C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551779\nBoth male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animal's state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Haller's organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Haller's organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.\nTxnip deletions and missense alleles prolong the survival of cones in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model\nAuthors: Xue, Y.; Cepko, C. L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551766\nRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a prevalent inherited retinal degenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 4,000 people. The disease is characterized by an initial loss of night vision followed by a loss of daylight and color vision. Many of the RP disease genes are expressed in the rod photoreceptors, the cell type that initiates dim light vision. Following loss of rods, the cone photoreceptors, which initiate daylight vision, also are affected and can die leading to total loss of vision. The reasons for loss of cone vision are not entirely clear, but appear to be due to loss of the rods. Previously we showed that overexpressing Txnip, an -arrestin protein, in mouse models of RP using AAV gene therapy prolonged the survival of RP cones (Xue et al. 2021). At least part of the mechanism for cone survival was a switch in the fuel source, from glucose to lactate. In addition, the mitochondria of cones were both morphologically and functionally improved by delivery of Txnip. We have gone on to test several alleles of Txnip for the ability to prolong cone survival in rd1, a mouse model of RP. In addition, proteins that bind to Txnip and/or have homology to Txnip were tested. Five different deletions of Txnip were expressed in cones or the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Here we show that the C-terminal half of Txnip (149-397aa) is sufficient to remove GLUT1 from the RPE cell surface, and improved rd1 cone survival when expressed specifically in the RPE. Overexpressing Arrdc4, an -arrestin that shares 60% similar protein sequence to Txnip, reduced rd1 cone survival. Reduction of the expression of HSP90AB1, a protein that interacts with Txnip and regulates metabolism, improved the survival of rd1 cones alone and was additive for cone survival when combined with Txnip. However, full length Txnip with a single amino acid change, C247S, remains the most highly efficacious form of the gene for cone rescue. The above observations suggest that only a subset of the hypothesized and known activities of Txnip play a role in promoting RP cone survival, and that the activities of Txnip in the RPE differ from those in cone photoreceptors.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2&#43; enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2&#43; sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2&#43; handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTrafficking of GLUcose Transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from the adipocyte vesicular pool to the cell surface is tightly regulated by insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to changing demands in energy consumption. Previously, endosomal Na&#43;/H&#43; exchanger 6 (NHE6, gene name SLC9A6) was identified in adipocyte plasma membranes and shown to associate with GLUT4-positive vesicles. However, the functional contribution of NHE6 to GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake remained uncharacterized.

MethodsNHE6 was knocked down in 3T3L1 cells either before or after differentiation into adipocytes using lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose into adipocytes was quantified in response to insulin. We used epitope tagged constructs to distinguish between localization of vesicular and surface levels of NHE6 and GLUT4 proteins. Protein and transcript levels of components of the glucose signaling pathway were monitored by qPCR and Western analysis, respectively, in response to NHE6 knockdown and/or treatment with chemical modulators of endosomal pH.

ResultsWe show that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes is severely impaired upon NHE6 depletion. Correspondingly, insulin-stimulated surface expression of GLUT4 at the adipocyte plasma membrane was diminished in NHE6 knockdown cells due to a post-transcriptional decrease in basal GLUT4. Metformin response of GLUT4 was also muted in the absence of NHE6. Further, we demonstrate diminished activation of the GLUT4 translocation pathway in the absence of NHE6 via reduced expression of the insulin receptor and reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Akt. Components of GLUT4 storage vesicles, including GLUT4, LRP1 and sortilin were downregulated in NHE6-knockdown adipocytes under basal conditions. Proteostatic control of key components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptor, GLUT4) could be restored by chemical bypass of NHE6 using the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or the Na&#43;/H&#43; exchanger mimetic monensin.

ConclusionsThus, NHE6 is critical for proper expression and trafficking of GLUT4. Basal expression of both insulin receptor and GLUT4 in NHE6 knockdown cells could be restored by bafilomycin-inhibition of the H&#43;-ATPase or the H&#43; ionophore monensin pointing to pH dysregulation as the underlying defect. We suggest that NHE6 is a component of GLUT4 storage vesicles where it regulates proteostasis. These findings establish NHE6 as a novel contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism with implications for Christianson syndrome patients who carry loss of function mutations in the SLC9A6 gene.

        <p class="abstract">In addition to canonical photoreception by the eye, many other organs express non-visual photoreceptors although their biological significance is mostly unknown. Here, we discovered a novel phenomenon in which the pituitary of medaka directly receives light, which induces hormone release. Ca2&#43; imaging analysis revealed that a melanotroph, a pituitary endocrine cell secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), robustly increases [Ca2&#43;]i during short-wavelength light irradiation. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule of this mechanism. The significance of this phenomenon was suggested to be involved in UV protection because knockout of opn5m significantly reduced the expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, in the skin. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary endocrine cells triggers the pathway to enhance UV protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life stress experiences can produce lasting impacts on organismal adaptation and fitness. How transient stress elicits memory-like physiological effects is largely unknown. Here we show that early-life thermal stress strongly up-regulates tsp-1, a gene encoding the conserved transmembrane tetraspanin in C. elegans. TSP-1 forms prominent multimers and stable web like structures critical for membrane barrier functions in adults and during aging. Up-regulation of TSP-1 is long lasting even after transient early-life stress. Such regulation requires CBP-1, a histone acetyl-transference that facilitates initial tsp-1 transcription. Tetraspanin webs form regular membrane structures and mediate resilience-promoting effects of early-life thermal stress. Gain-of-function TSP-1 confers striking C. elegans longevity extension and thermal resilience in human cells. Together, our results reveal a cellular mechanism by which early-life thermal stress produces long-lasting memory-like impact on organismal resilience and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introductory paragraphDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked muscle wasting disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 males worldwide1. It is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which compromises muscle integrity, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness2. Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for patients with DMD as they delay the loss of ambulation by an average of 3 years3; however, they are also associated with adverse effects such as insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes4. Thus, alternative therapeutic options should be explored. Here, we show that treating the DBA/2J mdx mouse with the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor, tideglusib, improved skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity, while also attenuating the hypermetabolic phenotype previously observed in these mice5. Furthermore, treating mdx mice with the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, augmented the benefits of voluntary wheel running on insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle function despite running half of the total distance compared to control-treated mdx mice. This is important given that some patients with DMD may not be able to engage in adequate amounts of physical activity. Thus, GSK3 inhibition alone or in combination with exercise can enhance skeletal muscle function and insulin sensitivity in mdx mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early life stress increases obesity risk, but its impact on weight loss maintenance is unknown. Mice underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) from 0-3 weeks and were weaned onto high fat sucrose diet (HFSD) from 3-20 weeks. Calorie-restricted weight loss on a low fat sucrose diet (LFSD) occurred over 2 weeks to induce a 20% loss in body weight, which was maintained for 6 weeks. After weight loss, half the mice received running wheels (EX) the other half remained sedentary (SED). Mice were then fed ad libitum on HFSD or LFSD for 10 weeks and allowed to regain body weight. NMS mice had greater weight regain, total body weight and adiposity compared to naive mice. During the first week of refeeding, NMS mice had increased food intake and were in a greater positive energy balance than naive mice, but total energy expenditure was not affected by NMS. Female mice were more susceptible to NMS-induced effects, including increases in adiposity. NMS and naive females were more susceptible to HFSD-induce weight regain. Exercise was beneficial in the first week of regain in male mice, but long-term only those on LFSD benefited from EX. As expected, HFSD led to greater weight regain than LFSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Timing of biological processes enable organisms to sustain the diurnal fluctuations resulting from earths rotation. Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms. However, mRNA oscillations often dont concur with the downstream protein oscillations. To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified &gt;1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, &gt;40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and &gt; 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas. Owing to Chlamydomonass unique phylogeny this study can lead to new insights into evolution of clock regulation across kingdoms.</p>

However, it remains a challenge to target the HIF signaling pathway without dysregulating the skeletal and hematopoietic system. Here, we examined the effects of Vhl deletion in bone by performing longitudinal analyses of VhlcKO mice at 3, 6, 10, and 24 weeks of age, where at 10 and 24 weeks of age, high bone mass and splenomegaly are present. Using flow cytometry, we observed increased frequency (%) of CD71loTER119hiFSClo orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes in 10- and 24-week-old VhlcKO bone marrow (BM), which correlated with elevated erythropoietin levels in the BM and increased number of red blood cells in circulation. The absolute numbers of myeloerythroid progenitors (MEPs) in the BM were significantly reduced at 24 weeks. Bulk RNA-Seq of the MEPs showed upregulation of Epas1 (Hif1a) and Efnb2 (Hif2a) in VhlcKO MEPs, consistent with a response to hypoxia, and genes involved in erythrocyte development, actin filament organization, and response to glucose. Additionally, histological analysis of VhlcKO spleens revealed red pulp hyperplasia and the presence of megakaryocytes, both of which are features of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). EMH in the spleen was correlated with the presence of mature stress erythroid progenitors, suggesting that stress erythropoiesis is occurring to compensate for the BM microenvironmental irregularities. Our studies implicate that HIF-driven alterations in skeletal homeostasis can accelerate erythropoiesis.

Key Points* Dysregulation of HIF signaling in Dmp1&#43; bone cells induces stress erythropoiesis.

* Skeletal homeostasis modulates erythropoiesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Both male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. We show that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations. Behavioral reactions to CO2 depend on the animal&#39;s state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest. Contrary to popular belief, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Haller&#39;s organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Haller&#39;s organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking have not yet been identified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a prevalent inherited retinal degenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 4,000 people. The disease is characterized by an initial loss of night vision followed by a loss of daylight and color vision. Many of the RP disease genes are expressed in the rod photoreceptors, the cell type that initiates dim light vision. Following loss of rods, the cone photoreceptors, which initiate daylight vision, also are affected and can die leading to total loss of vision. The reasons for loss of cone vision are not entirely clear, but appear to be due to loss of the rods. Previously we showed that overexpressing Txnip, an -arrestin protein, in mouse models of RP using AAV gene therapy prolonged the survival of RP cones (Xue et al. 2021). At least part of the mechanism for cone survival was a switch in the fuel source, from glucose to lactate. In addition, the mitochondria of cones were both morphologically and functionally improved by delivery of Txnip. We have gone on to test several alleles of Txnip for the ability to prolong cone survival in rd1, a mouse model of RP. In addition, proteins that bind to Txnip and/or have homology to Txnip were tested. Five different deletions of Txnip were expressed in cones or the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Here we show that the C-terminal half of Txnip (149-397aa) is sufficient to remove GLUT1 from the RPE cell surface, and improved rd1 cone survival when expressed specifically in the RPE. Overexpressing Arrdc4, an -arrestin that shares 60% similar protein sequence to Txnip, reduced rd1 cone survival. Reduction of the expression of HSP90AB1, a protein that interacts with Txnip and regulates metabolism, improved the survival of rd1 cones alone and was additive for cone survival when combined with Txnip. However, full length Txnip with a single amino acid change, C247S, remains the most highly efficacious form of the gene for cone rescue. The above observations suggest that only a subset of the hypothesized and known activities of Txnip play a role in promoting RP cone survival, and that the activities of Txnip in the RPE differ from those in cone photoreceptors.</p>
