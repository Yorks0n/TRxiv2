D.; Sylow, L.; Kiens, B.; Richter, E.; Kleinert, M.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.551603\nMetabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.\nPancreatic islet α cell function and proliferation requires the arginine transporter SLC7A2\nAuthors: Spears, E.; Stanley, J. E.; Shou, M.; Dai, C.; Bradley, A.; Yin, L.; Li, X.; Sellick, K.; Poffenberger, G.; Coate, K. C.; Shrestha, S. D.; Jenkins, R.; Sloop, K.; Wilson, K. T.; Attie, A. D.; Keller, M. P.; Chen, W.; Powers, A. C.; Dean, E. D.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552656\nInterrupting glucagon signaling decreases gluconeogenesis and the fractional extraction of amino acids by liver from blood resulting in lower glycemia. The resulting hyperaminoacidemia stimulates cell proliferation and glucagon secretion via a liver- cell axis. We hypothesized that cells detect and respond to circulating amino acids levels via a unique amino acid transporter repertoire. We found that Slc7a2/SLC7A2 is the most highly expressed cationic amino acid transporter in cells with its expression being three-fold greater in than {beta} cells in both mouse and human. Employing cell culture, zebrafish, and knockout mouse models, we found that the cationic amino acid arginine and SLC7A2 are required for cell proliferation in response to interrupted glucagon signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo assessment of islet function in Slc7a2-/- mice showed decreased arginine-stimulated glucagon and insulin secretion. We found that arginine activation of mTOR signaling and induction of the glutamine transporter SLC38A5 was dependent on SLC7A2, showing that both's role in cell proliferation is dependent on arginine transport and SLC7A2. Finally, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC7A2 associated with HbA1c. Together, these data indicate a central role for SLC7A2 in amino acid-stimulated cell proliferation and islet hormone secretion.\nInflammation causes insulin resistance via interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated reduction in FAHFA levels\nAuthors: Yan, S.; Santoro, A.; Niphakis, M. J.; Pinto, A. M.; Jacobs, C. L.; Ahmad, R.; Suciu, R. M.; Fonslow, B. R.; Herbst-Graham, R. B.; Ngo, N.; Henry, C. L.; Herbst, D. M.; Saghatelian, A.; Kahn, B. B.; Rosen, E. D.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552481\nObesity-induced inflammation causes metabolic dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the innate immune transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) adversely affects glucose homeostasis through induction of the endogenous FAHFA hydrolase androgen induced gene 1 (AIG1) in adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of IRF3 protects mice against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of IRF3 or AIG1 in adipocytes promotes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AIG1 reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance and restored glucose homeostasis in the setting of adipocyte IRF3 overexpression. We, therefore, identify the adipocyte IRF3/AIG1 axis as a crucial link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and suggest an approach for limiting the metabolic dysfunction accompanying obesity.\nDifferences in the Pupillary Responses to Evening Light between Children and Adolescents\nAuthors: Hartstein, L. E.; LeBourgeois, M. K.; Durniak, M. T.; Najjar, R. P.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552691\nPurpose: To assess differences in the pupillary light responses (PLRs) to blue and red evening lights between children and adolescents. Methods: Forty healthy participants (8-9 years, n=21; 15-16 years, n=19) completed a PLR assessment 1 h before their habitual bedtime. After a 1 h dim-light adaptation period (\u003c1 lux), baseline pupil diameter was measured in darkness for 30 s, followed by a 10 s exposure to 3.0x1013 photons/cm2/s of either red (627 nm) or blue (459 nm) light, and a 40 s recovery in darkness to assess pupillary re-dilation. Subsequently, participants underwent 7 min of dim-light re-adaptation followed by an exposure to the other light condition. Lights were counterbalanced across participants. Results: Across both age groups, maximum pupil constriction was significantly greater (p\u003c 0.001, {eta}p2=0.48) and more sustained (p\u003c 0.001, {eta}p2=0.41) during exposure to blue compared to red light. For adolescents, the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR), a hallmark of melanopsin function, was larger after blue compared with red light (p= 0.02, d=0.60). This difference was not observed in children. Across light exposures, children had larger phasic (p\u003c 0.01, {eta}p2=0.20) and maximal (p\u003c 0.01, {eta}p2=0.22) pupil constrictions compared to adolescents. Conclusions: Blue light elicited a greater and more sustained pupillary response than red light across participants. However, the overall amplitude of the rod/cone-driven phasic response was greater in children than in adolescents. Our findings using the PLR highlight a higher sensitivity to evening light in children compared to adolescents, and continued maturation of the human non-visual photoreception/system throughout development.\nTGF-β Ligand Cross-Subfamily Interactions in the Response of Caenorhabditis elegans to Bacterial Pathogens\nAuthors: Ciccarelli, E. J.; Wing, Z.; Bendelstein, M.; Johal, R. K.; Singh, G.; Monas, A.; Savage-Dunn, C.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.05.539606\nThe Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-{beta}) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that are synergistic, cooperative, additive, and/or antagonistic. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-{beta} ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-{beta} ligands play a role in the immune response. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-{beta} ligands act cooperatively as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands - DBL-1 and TIG-2 - function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-{beta}/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function cooperatively. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-{beta}/Activin signaling pathway do not play a role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamily ligands to interact, and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.\nA neuronal relay mediates muscle-adipose communication that drives systemic metabolic adaptation to high-sugar diets\nAuthors: Kubrak, O.; Joergensen, A. F.; Koyama, T.; Nagy, S.; Lassen, M.; Hald, J.; Madsen, D.; Halberg, K. V.; Texada, M. J.; Hansen, J. L.; Rewitz, K.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553340\nObesity leads to impaired insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity, which drive the onset of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance leads to a reduction in cellular glucose uptake, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels, which consequently cause beta-cell dysfunction and development of diabetes. Although improving insulin signaling is a key target for restoring whole-body glucose homeostasis and reversing diabetes, the multi-organ mechanisms that regulate insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity are poorly defined. We screened the secretome and receptome in Drosophila to identify the underlying interorgan hormonal crosstalk affecting diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. We identified complex interplay between muscle, neuronal, and fat tissues, mediated by the conserved BMP and LGR signaling pathways, which augments insulin signaling and improves dietary sugar tolerance. We found that muscle-derived BMP signaling is induced by sugar and governs neuronal Bursicon signaling. Acting through its LGR-family receptor, Bursicon both enhances insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, thereby preventing sugar-induced hyperglycemia. Inhibition of Bursicon-LGR signaling in adipose tissue exacerbates sugar-induced insulin resistance, and we discovered that this condition could be alleviated by suppressing NF-kappaB signaling. Our findings identify a muscle-neuronal-fat tissue axis that drives metabolic adaptation to high-sugar conditions by modulating insulin secretion and adipocyte insulin sensitivity, highlighting mechanisms that may be exploited for the development of strategies for the treatment and reversal of insulin resistance.\nThiazolidinediones are partially effective bitter blockers\nAuthors: Nguyen, H.; Lin, C.; Sasimovich, I.; Bell, K.; Huang, A.; Leszkowicz, E.; Rawson, N.; Reed, D. R.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552460\nPurposeThe bad bitter taste of some medicines is a barrier to overcoming non-compliance with medication use, especially life-saving drugs given to children and the elderly. Here we evaluated a new class of bitter blockers (thiazolidinediones; TZDs). MethodsIn this study, two TZDs were tested, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and a simpler form of TZD, using a high-potency sweetener as a positive control (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, NHDC). We tested bitter-blocking effects using the bitter drugs tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), a treatment for HIV and hepatitis B infection, and praziquantel (PRAZ), a treatment for schistosomiasis, by conducting taste testing with two separate taste panels: a general panel (N=97, 20-23 yrs, 82.5% female, all Eastern European) and a genetically informative panel (N=158, including 68 twin pairs, 18-82 yrs, 76% female, 87% European ancestry). Participants rated the bitterness intensity of the solutions on a 100-point generalized visual analog scale. FindingsParticipants in both taste panels rated the bitter drugs TAF and PRAZ as less bitter on average when mixed with NHDC than when sampled alone. ROSI partially suppressed the bitterness of TAF and PRAZ, but effectiveness differed between the two panels: bitterness was significantly reduced for PRAZ but not TAF in the general panel and for TAF but not PRAZ in the genetically informative panel. ROSI was a more effective blocker than the other TZD. ImplicationsThese results suggest that TZDs are partially effective bitter blockers, suggesting other TZDs should be designed and tested with more drugs and on diverse populations to define which ones work best with which drugs and for whom. The discovery of bitter receptor blockers can improve compliance with medication use.\nEffects of shoe heel height on ankle dynamics in running\nAuthors: Yawar, A.; Lieberman, D. E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552471\nShoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 -- 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.\nRapid, high-throughput phenotypic profiling of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) using benchtop flow cytometry\nAuthors: Anthony, C. J.; Lock, C. C.; Bentlage, B.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.06.519248\nEndosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary producer of energy for many cnidarians, including corals. The intricate coral-dinoflagellate symbiotic relationship is becoming increasingly important under climate change, as its breakdown leads to mass coral bleaching and often mortality. Despite methodological progress, assessing the phenotypic traits of Symbiodiniaceae in-hospite remains a complex task. Bio-optics, biochemistry, or \"-omics\" techniques are expensive, often inaccessible to investigators, or lack the resolution required to understand single-cell phenotypic states within endosymbiotic dinoflagellate assemblages. To help address this issue, we developed a protocol that collects information on cell autofluorescence, shape, and size to simultaneously generate phenotypic profiles for thousands of Symbiodiniaceae cells, thus revealing phenotypic variance of the Symbiodiniaceae assemblage to the resolution of single cells. As flow cytometry is adopted as a robust and efficient method for cell counting, integration of our protocol into existing workflows allows researchers to acquire a new level of resolution for studies examining the acclimation and adaptation strategies of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages.\nAnalysis of RyR2 distribution in HEK293 cells and mouse cardiac myocytes using 3D MINFLUX microscopy\nAuthors: Clowsley, A. H.; Meletiou, A.; Lucinskaite, E.; Jansen, I.; Jones, P. P.; Louch, W. E.; Soeller, C.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550636\nThe cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2+ enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2+ sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2+ handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interrupting glucagon signaling decreases gluconeogenesis and the fractional extraction of amino acids by liver from blood resulting in lower glycemia. The resulting hyperaminoacidemia stimulates  cell proliferation and glucagon secretion via a liver- cell axis. We hypothesized that  cells detect and respond to circulating amino acids levels via a unique amino acid transporter repertoire. We found that Slc7a2/SLC7A2 is the most highly expressed cationic amino acid transporter in  cells with its expression being three-fold greater in  than {beta} cells in both mouse and human. Employing cell culture, zebrafish, and knockout mouse models, we found that the cationic amino acid arginine and SLC7A2 are required for  cell proliferation in response to interrupted glucagon signaling. Ex vivo and in vivo assessment of islet function in Slc7a2-/- mice showed decreased arginine-stimulated glucagon and insulin secretion. We found that arginine activation of mTOR signaling and induction of the glutamine transporter SLC38A5 was dependent on SLC7A2, showing that both&#39;s role in  cell proliferation is dependent on arginine transport and SLC7A2. Finally, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC7A2 associated with HbA1c. Together, these data indicate a central role for SLC7A2 in amino acid-stimulated  cell proliferation and islet hormone secretion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity-induced inflammation causes metabolic dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that the innate immune transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) adversely affects glucose homeostasis through induction of the endogenous FAHFA hydrolase androgen induced gene 1 (AIG1) in adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of IRF3 protects mice against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, whereas overexpression of IRF3 or AIG1 in adipocytes promotes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of AIG1 reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance and restored glucose homeostasis in the setting of adipocyte IRF3 overexpression. We, therefore, identify the adipocyte IRF3/AIG1 axis as a crucial link between obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and suggest an approach for limiting the metabolic dysfunction accompanying obesity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: To assess differences in the pupillary light responses (PLRs) to blue and red evening lights between children and adolescents. Methods: Forty healthy participants (8-9 years, n=21; 15-16 years, n=19) completed a PLR assessment 1 h before their habitual bedtime. After a 1 h dim-light adaptation period (&lt;1 lux), baseline pupil diameter was measured in darkness for 30 s, followed by a 10 s exposure to 3.0x1013 photons/cm2/s of either red (627 nm) or blue (459 nm) light, and a 40 s recovery in darkness to assess pupillary re-dilation. Subsequently, participants underwent 7 min of dim-light re-adaptation followed by an exposure to the other light condition. Lights were counterbalanced across participants. Results: Across both age groups, maximum pupil constriction was significantly greater (p&lt; 0.001, {eta}p2=0.48) and more sustained (p&lt; 0.001, {eta}p2=0.41) during exposure to blue compared to red light. For adolescents, the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR), a hallmark of melanopsin function, was larger after blue compared with red light (p= 0.02, d=0.60). This difference was not observed in children. Across light exposures, children had larger phasic (p&lt; 0.01, {eta}p2=0.20) and maximal (p&lt; 0.01, {eta}p2=0.22) pupil constrictions compared to adolescents. Conclusions: Blue light elicited a greater and more sustained pupillary response than red light across participants. However, the overall amplitude of the rod/cone-driven phasic response was greater in children than in adolescents. Our findings using the PLR highlight a higher sensitivity to evening light in children compared to adolescents, and continued maturation of the human non-visual photoreception/system throughout development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-{beta}) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that are synergistic, cooperative, additive, and/or antagonistic. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-{beta} ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-{beta} ligands play a role in the immune response. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-{beta} ligands act cooperatively as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands - DBL-1 and TIG-2 - function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-{beta}/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function cooperatively. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-{beta}/Activin signaling pathway do not play a role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-{beta}/Activin subfamily ligands to interact, and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity leads to impaired insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity, which drive the onset of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance leads to a reduction in cellular glucose uptake, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels, which consequently cause beta-cell dysfunction and development of diabetes. Although improving insulin signaling is a key target for restoring whole-body glucose homeostasis and reversing diabetes, the multi-organ mechanisms that regulate insulin signaling and tissue sensitivity are poorly defined. We screened the secretome and receptome in Drosophila to identify the underlying interorgan hormonal crosstalk affecting diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. We identified complex interplay between muscle, neuronal, and fat tissues, mediated by the conserved BMP and LGR signaling pathways, which augments insulin signaling and improves dietary sugar tolerance. We found that muscle-derived BMP signaling is induced by sugar and governs neuronal Bursicon signaling. Acting through its LGR-family receptor, Bursicon both enhances insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, thereby preventing sugar-induced hyperglycemia. Inhibition of Bursicon-LGR signaling in adipose tissue exacerbates sugar-induced insulin resistance, and we discovered that this condition could be alleviated by suppressing NF-kappaB signaling. Our findings identify a muscle-neuronal-fat tissue axis that drives metabolic adaptation to high-sugar conditions by modulating insulin secretion and adipocyte insulin sensitivity, highlighting mechanisms that may be exploited for the development of strategies for the treatment and reversal of insulin resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThe bad bitter taste of some medicines is a barrier to overcoming non-compliance with medication use, especially life-saving drugs given to children and the elderly. Here we evaluated a new class of bitter blockers (thiazolidinediones; TZDs).

MethodsIn this study, two TZDs were tested, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and a simpler form of TZD, using a high-potency sweetener as a positive control (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, NHDC). We tested bitter-blocking effects using the bitter drugs tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), a treatment for HIV and hepatitis B infection, and praziquantel (PRAZ), a treatment for schistosomiasis, by conducting taste testing with two separate taste panels: a general panel (N=97, 20-23 yrs, 82.5% female, all Eastern European) and a genetically informative panel (N=158, including 68 twin pairs, 18-82 yrs, 76% female, 87% European ancestry). Participants rated the bitterness intensity of the solutions on a 100-point generalized visual analog scale.

FindingsParticipants in both taste panels rated the bitter drugs TAF and PRAZ as less bitter on average when mixed with NHDC than when sampled alone. ROSI partially suppressed the bitterness of TAF and PRAZ, but effectiveness differed between the two panels: bitterness was significantly reduced for PRAZ but not TAF in the general panel and for TAF but not PRAZ in the genetically informative panel. ROSI was a more effective blocker than the other TZD.

ImplicationsThese results suggest that TZDs are partially effective bitter blockers, suggesting other TZDs should be designed and tested with more drugs and on diverse populations to define which ones work best with which drugs and for whom. The discovery of bitter receptor blockers can improve compliance with medication use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 -- 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary producer of energy for many cnidarians, including corals. The intricate coral-dinoflagellate symbiotic relationship is becoming increasingly important under climate change, as its breakdown leads to mass coral bleaching and often mortality. Despite methodological progress, assessing the phenotypic traits of Symbiodiniaceae in-hospite remains a complex task. Bio-optics, biochemistry, or &#34;-omics&#34; techniques are expensive, often inaccessible to investigators, or lack the resolution required to understand single-cell phenotypic states within endosymbiotic dinoflagellate assemblages. To help address this issue, we developed a protocol that collects information on cell autofluorescence, shape, and size to simultaneously generate phenotypic profiles for thousands of Symbiodiniaceae cells, thus revealing phenotypic variance of the Symbiodiniaceae assemblage to the resolution of single cells. As flow cytometry is adopted as a robust and efficient method for cell counting, integration of our protocol into existing workflows allows researchers to acquire a new level of resolution for studies examining the acclimation and adaptation strategies of Symbiodiniaceae assemblages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a large homotetramer of a [~]560 kD subunit and is the molecular pathway through which the majority of Ca2&#43; enters the cytosol during cardiac activation. It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2&#43; sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision ([~]3 nm) in all directions. This allows determining not only the location but also the 3D orientation of individual RyR2 channels in intact cells. In practice, this capability is currently limited by a relatively modest effective labeling efficiency ([~]10 % subunit detection efficiency translating into [~]35% RyR2 labeling efficiency) which we measure in-situ using a novel procedure enabled by the true molecular resolution of MINFLUX microscopy. The new data suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data that may be at least partially explained by effects of labeling efficiency. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2&#43; handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches may be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.</p>
