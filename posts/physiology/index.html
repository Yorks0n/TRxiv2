S.; Watkins, C.; White, C.; Brown, C.; Eason, J. D.; Mozhui, K.; Kuscu, C.; Pabla, N.; Stephenson, E. J.; Bajwa, A.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573206\nObesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.\nAge-dependent RGS5 loss in pericytes induces cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in the heart\nAuthors: Tamiato, A.; Tombor, L.

T.; John, D.; Fleming, I.; Wettschureck, N.; Dimmeler, S.; Luxan, G.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570774\nBackgroundAgeing is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Pericytes are capillary-associated mural cells involved in the maintenance and stability of the vascular network. In the heart, the consequences of ageing on cardiac pericytes are unknown. MethodsIn this study, we have combined single nucleus RNA sequencing and histological analysis to determine the effects of ageing on cardiac pericytes. Furthermore, we have conducted in vivo and in vitro analysis of RGS5 loss of function and finally have perfomed pericytes-fibroblasts co-culture studies to understand the effect of RGS5 loss of function in pericytes on the neighbouring fibroblasts. ResultsWe showed that ageing reduces the pericyte area and coverage. Single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis further revealed that the expression of the Regulator of G protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) is reduced in old cardiac pericytes. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that the deletion of RGS5 induces morphological changes and a pro-fibrotic gene expression signature characterized by the expression of different extracellular matrix components and growth factors like TGFB2 and PDGFB in pericytes. Indeed, the culture of fibroblasts with the supernatant of RGS5 deficient pericytes induced their activation characterized by the increased expression of smooth muscle actin in a TFG{beta}2 dependent mechanism. ConclusionsOur results identify RGS5 as a crucial regulator of pericyte function during cardiac ageing. The deletion of RGS5 causes cardiac dysfunction and induces myocardial fibrosis, one of the hallmarks of cardiac ageing.\nProfiling cellular heterogeneity and fructose transporter expression in the rat nephron by integrating single-cell and microdissected tubule segment transcriptomes\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Jadhav, D. A.; Kramer, B. K.; Gonzalez-Vicente, A.; Kidney Precision Medicine Project, Score: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572656\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{+/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{+/-}9% S1, 58{+/-}8% S2, and 19{+/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{+/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p\u003c1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p\u003c4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.\nRefinement of a technique for collecting and evaluating the osmolality of haemolymph from Drosophila larvae\nAuthors: Kurio, M.; Tsukasa, Y.; Uemura, T.; Usui, T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573325\nex vivo physiological experiments using small insect models such as Drosophila larvae have become increasingly useful to address fundamental biological questions. To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination. Here, we greatly refined existing haemolymph collecting methods, evaluated the purity of the collected haemolymph under melanin-free conditions, and concluded that the true value of haemolymph osmolality is close to 306.0 mOsm kg-1 in Drosophila larvae.\nLipid peroxidation does not mediate muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency\nAuthors: Eshima, H.; Johnson, J. M.; Funai, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573082\nMechanisms by which disuse promotes skeletal muscle atrophy is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that disuse reduces the abundance of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in skeletal muscle. Deletion of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD), an enzyme that generates mitochondrial PE, was sufficient to promote muscle atrophy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deletion is driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Mice with muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) were crossed with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) transgenic mice (GPx4Tg) to suppress the accumulation of LOOH. However, PSD-MKO x GPx4Tg mice and PSD-MKO mice demonstrated equally robust loss of muscle mass. These results suggest that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency is not driven by the accumulation of LOOH.\nSpatially and Blood Flow-Dependent Tissue Distribution of Thyroid Hormones by Plasma Thyroid Hormone Binding Proteins\nAuthors: Bagga, A. D.; Johnson, B. P.; Zhang, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572629\nPlasma thyroid hormone (TH) binding proteins (THBPs), including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB), are important in regulating thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). THBPs carry THs to extrathyroidal sites, where THs are unloaded locally and then taken up via membrane transporters into the tissue proper. The respective roles of THBPs in supplying THs for tissue uptake are not completely understood. To investigate this question, we developed a spatial human physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model of THs, which produces several novel findings. (1) Contrary to postulations that TTR and/or ALB are the major local TH contributors, the three THBPs may unload comparable amounts of T4 in Liver, a rapidly perfused organ; however, their contribution in Rest-of-Body (RB), which is more slowly perfused, follows the order of abundance of T4TBG, T4TTR, and T4ALB. The T3 amounts unloaded in both compartments follow the order of abundance of T3TBG, T3ALB, and T3TTR. (2) Any THBP alone is sufficient to maintain spatially uniform TH tissue distributions. (3) The TH amounts unloaded by each THBP species are spatially dependent and nonlinear in a tissue, with ALB being the dominant contributor near the arterial end but conceding to TBG near the venous end. (4) Spatial gradients of TH transporters and metabolic enzymes may modulate these contributions, producing spatially invariant or heterogeneous TH tissue concentrations depending on whether the blood-tissue TH fluxes operate in near-equilibrium mode. In summary, our modeling provides novel insights into the differential roles of THBPs in local TH tissue distribution and homeostasis.\nc-fos induction in the choroid plexus, tanycytes and pars tuberalis is an early indicator of spontaneous arousal from torpor in a deep hibernator\nAuthors: Markussen, F. A. F.; Cazarez-Marquez, F.; Melum, V. J.; Hazlerigg, D.; Wood, S. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572338\nHibernation is an extreme state of seasonal energy conservation, reducing metabolic rate to as little as 1% of the active state. During the hibernation season, many species of hibernating mammals cycle repeatedly between the active (aroused) and hibernating (torpid) states (T-A cycling), using brown adipose tissue (BAT) to drive cyclical rewarming. The regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain undefined but are presumed to involve thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus. Here, we use the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and high-resolution monitoring of BAT, core body temperature (Tb), and ventilation rate, to sample at precisely defined phases of the T-A cycle. Using c-fos as a marker of cellular activity we show that although the dorso-medial hypothalamus (DMH) is active during torpor entry, neither it nor the pre-optic area (POA) show any significant changes during the earliest stages of spontaneous arousal. Contrastingly, in 3 non-neuronal sites previously linked to control of metabolic physiology over seasonal and daily timescales, the choroid plexus (CP), pars tuberalis (PT) and third ventricle tanycytes, peak c-fos expression is seen at arousal initiation. We suggest that through their sensitivity to factors in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these sites may mediate metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process. Summary statementNon-neuronal sites linked to control of daily and seasonal metabolic physiology, peak in c-fos expression during arousal from torpor, suggesting metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.\nHuman Heart Failure Alters Mitochondria and Fiber 3D Structure Triggering Metabolic Shifts\nAuthors: Vue, Z.; Ajayi, P.

The findings underscore the need for personalized treatments considering individualized structural changes in HF.\nImpaired Myofibroblast Proliferation is a Central Feature of Pathologic Post-Natal Alveolar Simplification\nAuthors: Khan, I. S.; Molina, C.; Ren, X.; Auyeung, V. C.; Cohen, M.; Tsukui, T.; Atakilit, A.; Sheppard, D.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572766\nPremature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF{beta}) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGF{beta} signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGF{beta} signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGF{beta} signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.\nExploration of the intricacies of low light-induced changes in cigar tobacco leaf anticlinal growth: A holistic approach from anatomical and hormonal levels to gene expression\nAuthors: Ma, X.; Yang, J.; Ren, X.; Chen, K.; Yang, C.; Gao, H.; Khan, R.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572520\nCigar tobacco stands as a pivotal economic crop, with its leaf growth and development profoundly influenced by light intensity. It specifically aims to investigate how leaf morphology and anticlinal growth respond to varying light intensities, including normal light intensity (NL-300 mol m-2 s-1) and lower light intensity (LL-100 mol m-2 s-1). The research elucidates significant morphological shifts in cigar tobacco leaves under LL, revealing notable alterations in leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width. Early reductions in leaf dimensions, ranging from 30% to 48%, were succeeded by a substantial enhancement in expansion rates from day 9 to day 26, contributing to expanded leaf surfaces at later stages. Upper epidermis thickness declined by 29-19%, with a notably slower expansion rate in the initial 20 days. Palisade cell length consistently decreased by 52-17%, corresponding with upper epidermis trends. Spongy tissue thickness was reduced by 31-12%, with a slower expansion rate in LL for the initial 14 days, and leaf thickness dropped by 34-11%. LL resulted in slower leaf anticlinal expansion, leading to reduced leaf thickness (LT). LL significantly influenced phytohormones in cigar tobacco leaves. Gibberellic acid (41% to 16%) and auxin (20% to 35%) levels were found in higher amounts, while cytokinin levels (19% to 5%) were lowered compared to NL, indicating the intricate regulatory role of light in hormonal dynamics. The observed increase in LT and different cell layers at specific time points (day 8, day 12, day 24, and day 28) under LL, although lower than NL, may be attributed to elevated expression of genes related to cell expansion, including GRF1, XTH, and SAUR19 at those time points. This comprehensive understanding elucidates the intricate mechanisms by which light intensity orchestrates the multifaceted processes governing leaf anatomy and anticlinal expansion in cigar tobacco plants.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAgeing is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Pericytes are capillary-associated mural cells involved in the maintenance and stability of the vascular network. In the heart, the consequences of ageing on cardiac pericytes are unknown.

MethodsIn this study, we have combined single nucleus RNA sequencing and histological analysis to determine the effects of ageing on cardiac pericytes. Furthermore, we have conducted in vivo and in vitro analysis of RGS5 loss of function and finally have perfomed pericytes-fibroblasts co-culture studies to understand the effect of RGS5 loss of function in pericytes on the neighbouring fibroblasts.

ResultsWe showed that ageing reduces the pericyte area and coverage. Single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis further revealed that the expression of the Regulator of G protein signalling 5 (Rgs5) is reduced in old cardiac pericytes. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that the deletion of RGS5 induces morphological changes and a pro-fibrotic gene expression signature characterized by the expression of different extracellular matrix components and growth factors like TGFB2 and PDGFB in pericytes. Indeed, the culture of fibroblasts with the supernatant of RGS5 deficient pericytes induced their activation characterized by the increased expression of  smooth muscle actin in a TFG{beta}2 dependent mechanism.

ConclusionsOur results identify RGS5 as a crucial regulator of pericyte function during cardiac ageing. The deletion of RGS5 causes cardiac dysfunction and induces myocardial fibrosis, one of the hallmarks of cardiac ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a crucial tool in kidney research. These technologies cluster cells according to transcriptome similarity, irrespective of the anatomical location and ordering within the nephron. Thus, a cluster transcriptome may obscure heterogeneity of the cell population within a nephron segment. Elevated dietary fructose leads to salt-sensitive hypertension, in part by fructose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT). However, organization of the four known fructose transporters in apical PTs (SGLT4, SGLT5, GLUT5 and NaGLT1) remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that cells within each subsegment of the proximal tubule exhibit complex, heterogenous fructose transporter expression patterns. To test this hypothesis we analyzed rat and kidney transcriptomes and proteomes from publicly available scRNAseq and tubule microdissection databases. We found that microdissected PT-S1 segments consist of 81{&#43;/-}12% cells with scRNAseq-derived transcriptional characteristics of S1, whereas PT-S2 express a mixture of 18{&#43;/-}9% S1, 58{&#43;/-}8% S2, and 19{&#43;/-}5% S3 transcripts, and PT-S3 consists of 75{&#43;/-}9% S3 transcripts. The expression of all four fructose transporters was detectable in all three PT segments, but key fructose transporters SGLT5 and GLUT5 progressively increased from S1 to S3, and both were significantly upregulated in S3 vs. S1/S2 (Slc5a10: 1.9 log2FC, p&lt;1x10-299; Scl2a5: 1.4 log2FC, p&lt;4x10-105). A similar distribution was found in human kidneys. These data suggest that S3 is the primary site of fructose reabsorption in both humans and rats. Finally, because of the multiple scRNAseq transcriptional phenotypes found in each segment our findings also imply that anatomic labels applied to scRNAseq clusters may be misleading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ex vivo physiological experiments using small insect models such as Drosophila larvae have become increasingly useful to address fundamental biological questions. To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination. Here, we greatly refined existing haemolymph collecting methods, evaluated the purity of the collected haemolymph under melanin-free conditions, and concluded that the true value of haemolymph osmolality is close to 306.0 mOsm kg-1 in Drosophila larvae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanisms by which disuse promotes skeletal muscle atrophy is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that disuse reduces the abundance of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in skeletal muscle. Deletion of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD), an enzyme that generates mitochondrial PE, was sufficient to promote muscle atrophy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deletion is driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Mice with muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) were crossed with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) transgenic mice (GPx4Tg) to suppress the accumulation of LOOH. However, PSD-MKO x GPx4Tg mice and PSD-MKO mice demonstrated equally robust loss of muscle mass. These results suggest that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency is not driven by the accumulation of LOOH.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plasma thyroid hormone (TH) binding proteins (THBPs), including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB), are important in regulating thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). THBPs carry THs to extrathyroidal sites, where THs are unloaded locally and then taken up via membrane transporters into the tissue proper. The respective roles of THBPs in supplying THs for tissue uptake are not completely understood. To investigate this question, we developed a spatial human physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model of THs, which produces several novel findings. (1) Contrary to postulations that TTR and/or ALB are the major local TH contributors, the three THBPs may unload comparable amounts of T4 in Liver, a rapidly perfused organ; however, their contribution in Rest-of-Body (RB), which is more slowly perfused, follows the order of abundance of T4TBG, T4TTR, and T4ALB. The T3 amounts unloaded in both compartments follow the order of abundance of T3TBG, T3ALB, and T3TTR. (2) Any THBP alone is sufficient to maintain spatially uniform TH tissue distributions. (3) The TH amounts unloaded by each THBP species are spatially dependent and nonlinear in a tissue, with ALB being the dominant contributor near the arterial end but conceding to TBG near the venous end. (4) Spatial gradients of TH transporters and metabolic enzymes may modulate these contributions, producing spatially invariant or heterogeneous TH tissue concentrations depending on whether the blood-tissue TH fluxes operate in near-equilibrium mode. In summary, our modeling provides novel insights into the differential roles of THBPs in local TH tissue distribution and homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hibernation is an extreme state of seasonal energy conservation, reducing metabolic rate to as little as 1% of the active state. During the hibernation season, many species of hibernating mammals cycle repeatedly between the active (aroused) and hibernating (torpid) states (T-A cycling), using brown adipose tissue (BAT) to drive cyclical rewarming. The regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain undefined but are presumed to involve thermoregulatory centres in the hypothalamus. Here, we use the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and high-resolution monitoring of BAT, core body temperature (Tb), and ventilation rate, to sample at precisely defined phases of the T-A cycle. Using c-fos as a marker of cellular activity we show that although the dorso-medial hypothalamus (DMH) is active during torpor entry, neither it nor the pre-optic area (POA) show any significant changes during the earliest stages of spontaneous arousal. Contrastingly, in 3 non-neuronal sites previously linked to control of metabolic physiology over seasonal and daily timescales, the choroid plexus (CP), pars tuberalis (PT) and third ventricle tanycytes, peak c-fos expression is seen at arousal initiation. We suggest that through their sensitivity to factors in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these sites may mediate metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.

Summary statementNon-neuronal sites linked to control of daily and seasonal metabolic physiology, peak in c-fos expression during arousal from torpor, suggesting metabolic feedback-based initiation of the spontaneous arousal process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF{beta}) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGF{beta} signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGF{beta} signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGF{beta} signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cigar tobacco stands as a pivotal economic crop, with its leaf growth and development profoundly influenced by light intensity. It specifically aims to investigate how leaf morphology and anticlinal growth respond to varying light intensities, including normal light intensity (NL-300 mol m-2 s-1) and lower light intensity (LL-100 mol m-2 s-1). The research elucidates significant morphological shifts in cigar tobacco leaves under LL, revealing notable alterations in leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width. Early reductions in leaf dimensions, ranging from 30% to 48%, were succeeded by a substantial enhancement in expansion rates from day 9 to day 26, contributing to expanded leaf surfaces at later stages. Upper epidermis thickness declined by 29-19%, with a notably slower expansion rate in the initial 20 days. Palisade cell length consistently decreased by 52-17%, corresponding with upper epidermis trends. Spongy tissue thickness was reduced by 31-12%, with a slower expansion rate in LL for the initial 14 days, and leaf thickness dropped by 34-11%. LL resulted in slower leaf anticlinal expansion, leading to reduced leaf thickness (LT). LL significantly influenced phytohormones in cigar tobacco leaves. Gibberellic acid (41% to 16%) and auxin (20% to 35%) levels were found in higher amounts, while cytokinin levels (19% to 5%) were lowered compared to NL, indicating the intricate regulatory role of light in hormonal dynamics. The observed increase in LT and different cell layers at specific time points (day 8, day 12, day 24, and day 28) under LL, although lower than NL, may be attributed to elevated expression of genes related to cell expansion, including GRF1, XTH, and SAUR19 at those time points. This comprehensive understanding elucidates the intricate mechanisms by which light intensity orchestrates the multifaceted processes governing leaf anatomy and anticlinal expansion in cigar tobacco plants.</p>
