J.\nScore: 37.2, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.23.512956\nAnalyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.\nInsulin at the Intersection of Thermoregulation and Glucose Homeostasis\nAuthors: Winn, N. C.; Schleh, M. W.; Garcia, J. N.; Lantier, L.; McGuinness, O. P.; Blair, J. A.; Hasty, A. H.; Wasserman, D. H.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.566254\nMammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (\u003c12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action, insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis. HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice. C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased. C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis. C_LIO_LIBrown fat glucose uptake sensitively increases with RT and decreases with TN by an insulin-independent mechanism.

A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568245\nPancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity. Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells. Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.\nFish Playpens: Method for raising individual juvenile zebrafish on a recirculating system for studies requiring repeated measures\nAuthors: Moll, T. O. C.; Farber, S. A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567840\nEven though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.\nQuantification of healthspan in aging mice: Introducing FAMY and GRAIL\nAuthors: Lamming, D. W.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566044\nThe population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.\nLoss of cardiac PFKFB2 drives Metabolic, Functional, and Electrophysiological Remodeling in the Heart\nAuthors: Harold, K. M.; Matsuzaki, S.; Pranay, A.; Loveland, B. L.; Batushansky, A.; Mendez Garcia, M. F.; Eyster, C. A.; Stavrakis, S.; Chiao, Y. A.; Kinter, M.; Humphries, K. M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568379\nBackground: Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) is a critical glycolytic regulator responsible for upregulation of glycolysis in response to insulin and adrenergic signaling. PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of PFK-2, is degraded in the heart in the absence of insulin signaling, contributing to diabetes-induced cardiac metabolic inflexibility. However, previous studies have not examined how the loss of PFKFB2 affects global cardiac metabolism and function. Methods: To address this, we have generated a mouse model with a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of PFKFB2 (cKO). Using 9-month-old cKO and control (CON) mice, we characterized impacts of PFKFB2 on cardiac metabolism, function, and electrophysiology. Results: cKO mice have a shortened lifespan of 9 months. Metabolically, cKO mice are characterized by increased glycolytic enzyme abundance and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, as well as decreased mitochondrial abundance and beta oxidation, suggesting a shift toward glucose metabolism. This was supported by a decrease in the ratio of palmitoyl carnitine to pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration in cKO relative to CON animals. Metabolomic, proteomic, and western blot data support the activation of ancillary glucose metabolism, including pentose phosphate and hexosamine biosynthesis pathways. Physiologically, cKO animals exhibited impaired systolic function and left ventricular (LV) dilation, represented by reduced fractional shortening and increased LV internal diameter, respectively. This was accompanied by electrophysiological alterations including increased QT interval and other metrics of delayed ventricular conduction. Conclusions: Loss of PFKFB2 results in metabolic remodeling marked by cardiac ancillary pathway activation. This could delineate an underpinning of pathologic changes to mechanical and electrical function in the heart.\nEccentric exercise is not equal to eccentric contraction\nAuthors: Tecchio, P.; Raiteri, B. J.; Hahn, D.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568422\nWhether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9-23.2 mm, p less than or equal to 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre- activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise.\nDrosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling reveals age related loss of intestinal amino acid transport regulates longevity\nAuthors: Mornement, A. A.; Dack, R. E.; Doupe, D. P.; Clark, R. I.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564159\nAge-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies. In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies. Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.\nUtilization of the genetically encoded calcium indicator Salsa6F in cardiac applications\nAuthors: Marquez-Nogueras, K. M.; Bovo, E.; Cao, Q.; Zima, A. V.; Kuo, I. Y.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568284\nCalcium signaling is a critical process required for cellular mechanisms such as cardiac contractility. The inability of the cell to properly activate or regulate calcium signaling can lead to contractile dysfunction. In isolated cardiomyocytes, calcium signaling has been primarily studied using calcium fluorescent dyes, however these dyes have limited applicability to whole organs. Here, we crossed the Salsa6f mouse which expresses a genetically encoded ratiometric cytosolic calcium indicator with a cardiomyocyte specific inducible cre to temporally-induce expression and studied cytosolic calcium transients in isolated cardiomyocytes and modified Langendorff heart preparations. Isolated cardiomyocytes expressing Salsa6f or Fluo-4AM loaded were compared. We also crossed the Salsa6f mouse with a floxed Polycystin 2 (PC2) mouse to test the feasibility of using the Salsa6f mouse to measure calcium transients in PC2 heterozygous or homozygous knock out mice. Although there are caveats in the applicability of the Salsa6f mouse, there are clear advantages to using the Salsa6f mouse to measure whole heart calcium signals.\nPartial resistance to thyroid hormone-induced tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy in mice lacking thyroid hormone receptor beta\nAuthors: Dore, R.; Sentis, S. C.; Johann, K.; Lopez-Alcantara, N.; Resch, J.; Moeller, L. C.; Fuehrer, D.; Obermayer-Wasserscheid, B.; Opitz, R.; Mittag, J.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567193\nBackgroundThyroid hormones regulate cardiac functions mainly via direct actions in the heart and binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms 1 and {beta}. While the role of the most abundantly expressed isoform, TR1, is widely studied and well characterized, the role of TR{beta} in regulating heart functions is still poorly understood, primarily due to the accompanying elevation of circulating thyroid hormone in mice lacking TR{beta} (TR{beta}-KO). However, their hyperthyroidism is ameliorated at thermoneutrality, which allows studying the role of TR{beta} without this confounding factor. MethodsHere we non-invasively monitored heart rate in TR{beta}-KO mice over several days using radiotelemetry at different housing temperatures (22{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C), and upon T3 administration in comparison to wildtype animals. ResultsTR{beta}-KO mice displayed normal average heart rate at both 22{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C with only minor changes in heart rate frequency distribution, which was confirmed by independent electrocardiogram recordings in freely-moving conscious mice. Parasympathetic nerve activity was, however, impaired in TR{beta}-KO mice at 22{degrees}C, and only partly rescued at 30{degrees}C. As expected, oral treatment with pharmacological doses of T3 at 30{degrees}C led to tachycardia in wildtypes, accompanied by broader heart rate frequency distribution and increased heart weight, while TR{beta}-KO mice showed blunted tachycardia, as well as resistance to changes in heart rate frequency distribution and heart weight. At the molecular level, these observations were paralleled by a blunted cardiac mRNA induction of several important genes, including the pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4, as well as Kcna7. ConclusionsThe phenotyping of TR{beta}-KO mice conducted at thermoneutrality allows novel insights on the role of TR{beta} in cardiac functions in absence of the usual confounding hyperthyroidism. Even though TR{beta} is expressed at lower levels than TR1 in the heart, our findings demonstrate an important role for this isoform in the cardiac response to thyroid hormones.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Analyses of mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle have mostly used whole-muscle samples, where results may be confounded by the presence of a mixture of type I and II muscle fibres. Using our adapted mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow, we provide new insights into fibre-specific mitochondrial differences in human skeletal muscle before and after training. Our findings challenge previous conclusions regarding the extent of fibre-type-specific remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome and highlight that most baseline differences in mitochondrial protein abundances between fibre types reported by us, and others, might be due to differences in total mitochondrial content or a consequence of adaptations to habitual physical activity (or inactivity). Most training-induced changes in different mitochondrial functional groups, in both fibre types, were stoichiometrically linked to changes in markers of mitochondrial content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammals are protected from changes in environmental temperature by altering energetic processes that modify heat production. Insulin is the dominant stimulus of glucose uptake and metabolism, which are fundamental for thermogenic processes. The purpose of this work was to determine the interaction of ambient temperature induced changes in energy expenditure (EE) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose fluxes. Short-term and adaptive responses to thermoneutral temperature (TN, [~]28{degrees}C) and room (laboratory) temperature (RT, [~]22{degrees}C) were studied in mice. This range of temperature does not cause detectable changes in circulating catecholamines or shivering and postabsorptive glucose homeostasis is maintained. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in EE that occurs with TN causes insulin resistance and that this reduction in insulin action and EE is reversed upon short term (&lt;12h) transition to RT. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and tissue specific glucose uptake were assessed combining isotopic tracers with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. EE and insulin-stimulated Rd are both decreased ([~]50%) in TN-adapted vs RT-adapted mice. When RT-adapted mice are switched to TN, EE rapidly decreases and Rd is reduced by [~]50%. TN-adapted mice switched to RT exhibit a rapid increase in EE, but whole body insulin-stimulated Rd remains at the low rates of TN-adapted mice. In contrast, whole body glycolytic flux rose with EE. This higher EE occurs without increasing glucose uptake from the blood, but rather by diverting glucose from glucose storage to glycolysis. In addition to adaptations in insulin action,  insulin-independent glucose uptake in brown fat is exquisitely sensitive to thermoregulation. These results show that insulin action adjusts to non-stressful changes in ambient temperature to contribute to the support of body temperature homeostasis without compromising glucose homeostasis.

HighlightsO_LIEnergy expenditure and insulin-mediated glucose fluxes are reduced in thermoneutral (TN)-adapted mice versus room  laboratory temperature (RT)-adapted mice.
C_LIO_LIReduced insulin sensitivity manifests in TN mice regardless of whether they are TN-adapted or short-term transitioned from RT-adapted to TN.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice are resistant to the RT-induced increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity even though metabolic rate is increased.
C_LIO_LITN-adapted mice switched to RT meets increased thermogenic needs, not by increasing glucose uptake, but by partitioning a greater fraction of glucose from glycogen storage to glycolysis.

        <p class="abstract">Pancreatic islets are 3-dimensional micro-organs that maintain {beta}-cell functionality via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication. Isolated primary islets are the gold standard for in vitro models. However, native islets present experimental challenges for long-term mechanistic studies owing to their short culture life (approximately 1 week). We developed a novel long-term protocol to study the function of primary islets. The protocol employed reformed islets following dispersion and a fine-tuned culture environment. Reformed islets are highly similar to their primary counterparts across various physiological characteristics. Long-term culture of reformed islets enables high-resolution imaging, repeated functional assessment, and the study of cell-cell communication. Unlike other platforms such as stem cell-derived organoids, reformed islets retain their resident immune populations, making them ideal for studying both resident and infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with hormone-producing islet cells. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the composition and cytoarchitecture of the reformed islets mimicked those found in primary islets, including the presence of macrophages and CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, which are the key resident immune cell types. Reformed islets secrete insulin and are glucose-responsive, and their {beta}-cells can be stimulated to proliferate using GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomic landscape of isolated human islets and reformed islets generated from the same donor demonstrated a high degree of similarity. Our reformed islets provide an ideal platform to study diabetes pathology. We recapitulated both the T1DM and T2DM disease milieu and validated our model for studying islet immune trafficking and invasion using activated macrophages and T cells. Our data illustrates that reformed islets are an anatomical and functional alternative to native human and mouse islets. Moreover, reformed islets have an advantage over mouse and human {beta}-cell lines, including MIN6 and EndoC-{beta}H1cells, that lack the signalling input of non-{beta}-endocrine cells and immune cell crosstalk. In this study, we showed that reformed islets are a durable paradigm (cell-based model) for islet-based exploration and a means of target discovery/validation for diabetes research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Even though many experimental approaches benefit from tracking individual larval animals, there is yet to be a commercial zebrafish rack system designed to accomplish this task. Thus, we invented playpens, an acrylic and screen container, to raise 12 individual zebrafish juveniles per standard 10 L tank on an existing recirculating fish system. During a week-long experiment, fish raised in playpens grow to the same size as conventionally raised juveniles. Remarkably, fish grow up to a more uniform size, potentially due to less competition for food.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The population around the world is graying, and as many of these individuals will spend years suffering from the burdens of age associated diseases, understanding how to increase healthspan, defined as the period of life free from disease and disability, is an urgent priority of geroscience research. The lack of agreed-upon quantitative metrics for measuring healthspan in aging mice has slowed progress in identifying interventions that do not simply increase lifespan, but also healthspan. Here, we define FAMY (Frailty-Adjusted Mouse Years) and GRAIL (Gauging Robust Aging when Increasing Lifespan) as new summary statistics for quantifying healthspan in mice. FAMY is based entirely on a widely utilized clinical frailty index, while GRAIL incorporates frailty, widely utilized healthspan assays, and information about the hallmarks of aging. Both metrics are conceptually similar to quality-adjusted life years (QALY), a widely-utilized measure of disease burden in humans, and can be readily calculated from data acquired during longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of mouse aging. We find that interventions generally thought to promote health, including calorie restriction, robustly improve healthspan as measured by FAMY and GRAIL. Finally, we show that use of GRAIL provides new insights, and identify dietary restriction of protein or isoleucine as an intervention that promotes healthspan but not longevity in female HET3 mice. We suggest that the routine integration of these measures into studies of aging in mice will allow the identification and development of interventions that promote healthy aging even in the absence of increased lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) is a critical glycolytic regulator responsible for upregulation of glycolysis in response to insulin and adrenergic signaling. PFKFB2, the cardiac isoform of PFK-2, is degraded in the heart in the absence of insulin signaling, contributing to diabetes-induced cardiac metabolic inflexibility. However, previous studies have not examined how the loss of PFKFB2 affects global cardiac metabolism and function. Methods: To address this, we have generated a mouse model with a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of PFKFB2 (cKO). Using 9-month-old cKO and control (CON) mice, we characterized impacts of PFKFB2 on cardiac metabolism, function, and electrophysiology. Results: cKO mice have a shortened lifespan of 9 months. Metabolically, cKO mice are characterized by increased glycolytic enzyme abundance and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, as well as decreased mitochondrial abundance and beta oxidation, suggesting a shift toward glucose metabolism. This was supported by a decrease in the ratio of palmitoyl carnitine to pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration in cKO relative to CON animals. Metabolomic, proteomic, and western blot data support the activation of ancillary glucose metabolism, including pentose phosphate and hexosamine biosynthesis pathways. Physiologically, cKO animals exhibited impaired systolic function and left ventricular (LV) dilation, represented by reduced fractional shortening and increased LV internal diameter, respectively. This was accompanied by electrophysiological alterations including increased QT interval and other metrics of delayed ventricular conduction. Conclusions: Loss of PFKFB2 results in metabolic remodeling marked by cardiac ancillary pathway activation. This could delineate an underpinning of pathologic changes to mechanical and electrical function in the heart.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whether eccentric exercise involves active fascicle stretch is unclear due to muscle-tendon unit (MTU) series elasticity. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of changing the activation timing and level (i.e., pre-activation) on muscle fascicle kinematics and kinetics of the human tibialis anterior during dynamometer-controlled maximal voluntary MTU-stretch-hold contractions. B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography were employed to assess muscle fascicle kinematics and muscle activity levels, respectively. While joint kinematics were similar for MTU-stretch-hold contractions, increasing pre-activation increased fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes (9.9-23.2 mm, p less than or equal to 0.015). This led to increasing positive and negative fascicle work with increasing pre-activation. Despite significantly different fascicle kinematics, similar peak fascicle forces during stretch occurred at similar fascicle lengths and joint angles regardless of pre- activation. Similarly, residual force enhancement (rFE) following MTU stretch was not significantly affected (6.5-7.6 %, p = 0.559) by pre-activation, but rFE was strongly correlated with peak fascicle force during stretch (rrm = 0.62, p = 0.003). These findings highlight that apparent eccentric exercise causes shortening-stretch contractions at the fascicle level rather than isolated eccentric contractions. The constant rFE despite different fascicle kinematics and kinetics suggests that a passive element was engaged at a common muscle length among conditions (e.g., optimal fascicle length). Although it remains unclear whether different fascicle mechanics trigger different adaptations to eccentric exercise, this study emphasizes the need to consider MTU series elasticity to better understand the mechanical drivers of adaptation to exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Age-related decline results in changes to the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and a loss of barrier function, accompanied by elevated stress and immune signalling and alterations to the intestinal microbial population. Interventions that prevent these phenotypes support longevity across several model organisms. Despite this we do not yet know whether age-related intestinal decline impacts nutrient management, a key function of the intestinal epithelium. Addressing this question is critical given that nutritional interventions hold significant promise in the development of anti-ageing therapies.

In this study we have developed Drosophila Undigested Metabolite Profiling (D.U.M.P.) to assess the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient absorption/excretion balance. We demonstrate that ageing results in a significant increase in amino acid load in the intestinal lumen that shortens lifespan. While the microbiota contributes significantly to intestinal amino acid load, age-related increases remain in sterile flies and are associated with reduced expression of a subset of amino acid transporters. Knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast in the intestinal epithelium extends lifespan and confers improved microbial control in aged flies.

Our findings demonstrate that age-related intestinal decline may alter the capacity of the epithelium to take up nutrients, resulting in local changes to the nutritional environment that have consequences for health. We emphasise that diet is not the sole determinant of the intestinal nutritional environment, and that the status of the intestinal epithelium and its capacity for nutrient uptake is a key mediator in the response to dietary interventions. Therefore, further understanding the impact of intestinal ageing on nutrient management will be critical to the rational design of nutritional therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Calcium signaling is a critical process required for cellular mechanisms such as cardiac contractility. The inability of the cell to properly activate or regulate calcium signaling can lead to contractile dysfunction. In isolated cardiomyocytes, calcium signaling has been primarily studied using calcium fluorescent dyes, however these dyes have limited applicability to whole organs. Here, we crossed the Salsa6f mouse which expresses a genetically encoded ratiometric cytosolic calcium indicator with a cardiomyocyte specific inducible cre to temporally-induce expression and studied cytosolic calcium transients in isolated cardiomyocytes and modified Langendorff heart preparations. Isolated cardiomyocytes expressing Salsa6f or Fluo-4AM loaded were compared. We also crossed the Salsa6f mouse with a floxed Polycystin 2 (PC2) mouse to test the feasibility of using the Salsa6f mouse to measure calcium transients in PC2 heterozygous or homozygous knock out mice. Although there are caveats in the applicability of the Salsa6f mouse, there are clear advantages to using the Salsa6f mouse to measure whole heart calcium signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThyroid hormones regulate cardiac functions mainly via direct actions in the heart and binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms 1 and {beta}. While the role of the most abundantly expressed isoform, TR1, is widely studied and well characterized, the role of TR{beta} in regulating heart functions is still poorly understood, primarily due to the accompanying elevation of circulating thyroid hormone in mice lacking TR{beta} (TR{beta}-KO). However, their hyperthyroidism is ameliorated at thermoneutrality, which allows studying the role of TR{beta} without this confounding factor.

MethodsHere we non-invasively monitored heart rate in TR{beta}-KO mice over several days using radiotelemetry at different housing temperatures (22{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C), and upon T3 administration in comparison to wildtype animals.

ResultsTR{beta}-KO mice displayed normal average heart rate at both 22{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C with only minor changes in heart rate frequency distribution, which was confirmed by independent electrocardiogram recordings in freely-moving conscious mice. Parasympathetic nerve activity was, however, impaired in TR{beta}-KO mice at 22{degrees}C, and only partly rescued at 30{degrees}C. As expected, oral treatment with pharmacological doses of T3 at 30{degrees}C led to tachycardia in wildtypes, accompanied by broader heart rate frequency distribution and increased heart weight, while TR{beta}-KO mice showed blunted tachycardia, as well as resistance to changes in heart rate frequency distribution and heart weight. At the molecular level, these observations were paralleled by a blunted cardiac mRNA induction of several important genes, including the pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4, as well as Kcna7.

ConclusionsThe phenotyping of TR{beta}-KO mice conducted at thermoneutrality allows novel insights on the role of TR{beta} in cardiac functions in absence of the usual confounding hyperthyroidism. Even though TR{beta} is expressed at lower levels than TR1 in the heart, our findings demonstrate an important role for this isoform in the cardiac response to thyroid hormones.</p>
