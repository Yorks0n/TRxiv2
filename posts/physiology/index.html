E.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552471\nShoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.\nDifferential reaction norms to ocean acidification in two oyster species from contrasting habitats\nAuthors: Caillon, C.; Pernet, F.; Lutier, M.; Di Poi, C.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555611\nOcean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/pCO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we decipher the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species are tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters undergo remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work reveals species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seems to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.\nEnriched Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing reveals unique attributes of distal convoluted tubule cells\nAuthors: Su, X.-T.; Reyes, J. V.; Lackey, A. E.; Maeoka, Y.; Cornelius, R. J.; McCormick, J. A.; Yang, C.-L.; Jung, H. J.; Welling, P. A.; Nelson, J. W.; Ellison, D. H.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.555810\nBackgroundThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) comprises two subsegments, DCT1 and DCT2, with different functional and molecular characteristics. The functional and molecular distinction between these segments, however, has been controversial. MethodsTo understand the heterogeneity within the DCT population with better clarity, we enriched for DCT nuclei by using a mouse line combining \"Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types\" and NCC (sodium chloride cotransporter)-driven inducible Cre recombinase. We sorted the fluorescently labeled DCT nuclei using Fluorescence-Activated Nucleus Sorting, and performed single nucleus transcriptomics. ResultsAmong 25,183 DCT cells, 70% were from DCT1 and 30% from DCT2. Additionally, there was a small population (\u003c1%) enriched in proliferation-related genes, such asTop2a, Cenpp, and Mki67. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express NCC, magnesium transport genes are more abundant along DCT1; whereas calcium, electrogenic sodium and potassium transport genes are more abundant along DCT2. The transition between these two segments are gradual with a transitional zone where DCT1 and DCT2 cells are interspersed. The expression of the homeobox genes is not consistent between all DCT cells, suggesting that they develop along different trajectories. ConclusionTranscriptomics analysis of an enriched rare cell population using genetically targeted approach offers better clarification of the function and classification. The DCT segment is short, yet, can be separated into two sub-types that serve distinct functions, and are speculated to derive from different origins during development. Significance StatementHigh-resolution snRNAseq data indicate a clear separation between primary sites of calcium and magnesium handling within DCT. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express Slc12a3, but these subsegments serve distinctive functions, with more abundant magnesium handling genes along DCT1 and more calcium handling genes along DCT2. The data also provides insight into the plasticity of the distal nephron-collecting duct junction, formed from cells of separate embryonic origins. By focusing/changing gradients of gene expression, the DCT can morph into different physiological cell states on demand.\nEstrogen prevents age-dependent beige adipogenesis failure through NAMPT-controlled ER stress pathway\nAuthors: Park, J.; Hu, R.; Xiong, S.; Qian, Y.; El-Sabbagh, A. S.; Ibrahim, M.; Song, Q.; Yan, G.; Song, Z.; Mahmoud, A. M.; He, Y.; Layden, B. T.; Chen, J.; Ong, S.-G.; Xu, P. W.; Jiang, Y.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555821\nThermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process. HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice. C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress. C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the beige adipogenesis derived from SMA+ APCs. C_LIO_LIInhibiting the NAMPT signaling pathway abolishes estrogen-promoted beige adipogenesis.

This study examines how rearing zebrafish at low temperatures affects their locomotor activity and the expression of genes associated with muscle atrophy. Zebrafish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 10 {degrees}C to 25 {degrees}C, and their swimming distance was measured. The expression levels of important muscle atrophy genes, Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were also evaluated. Our findings show that swimming activity significantly decreases when the water temperature ranges from 10 {degrees}C to 15 {degrees}C, indicating a decrease in voluntary movement. Additionally, gene expression analysis shows a significant increase in the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 at 10 {degrees}C. This up-regulation could lead to muscle atrophy caused by decreased activity in cold temperatures. To investigate the effects of exercise on reducing muscle atrophy, we subjected zebrafish to forced swimming at a temperature of 8 {degrees}C for ten days. This treatment significantly reduced the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, emphasizing the importance of muscle stimulation in preventing muscle atrophy in zebrafish. These findings suggest that zebrafish can serve as a valuable model organism for studying muscle atrophy and can be utilized in drug screening for muscle atrophy-related disorders. Cold-reared zebrafish provide a practical and ethical approach to inducing disuse muscle atrophy, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing skeletal muscle atrophy.\nWhole organ volumetric sensing Ultrasound Localization Microscopy for characterization of kidney structure\nAuthors: Chabouh, G.; Denis, L.; Bodard, S.; Lager, F.; Renault, G.; chavignon, a.; couture, o.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555780\nGlomeruli are the filtration units of the kidney and their function relies heavily on their microcirculation. Despite its obvious diagnostic importance, an accurate estimation of blood flow in the capillary bundle within glomeruli defies the resolution of conventional imaging modalities. Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has demonstrated its ability to image in-vivo deep organs in the body. Recently, the concept of sensing ULM or sULM was introduced to classify individual microbubble behavior based on the expected physiological conditions at the micrometric scale. In the kidney of both rats and humans, it revealed glomerular structures in 2D but was severely limited by planar projection. In this work, we aim to extend sULM in 3D to image the whole organ and in order to perform an accurate characterization of the entire kidney structure. The extension of sULM into the 3D domain allows better localization and more robust tracking. The 3D metrics of velocity and pathway angular shift made glomerular mask possible. This approach facilitated the quantification of glomerular physiological parameter such as an interior traveled distance of approximately 7.5 {+/-} 0.6 microns within the glomerulus. This study introduces a technique that characterize the complete kidney phisiology which can serve as a method to facilite pathology assessment. Furthermore, its potential for clinical relevance could serve as a bridge between research and practical application, leading to innovative diagnostics and improved patient care.\nPromoting intestinal healing by exclusive enteral nutrition with TGF-beta in a mouse model of colitis.\nAuthors: Boumessid, K.; Lacroix, V.; Ovtchinnikova, E.; Quaranta-Nicaise, M.; Roy, M.; Dumay, A.; Thenet, S.; Carriere, M.; Mas, E.; Barreau, F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555691\nBackground and aimsExclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the first line of treatment for pediatric Crohns disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We studied EEN nutritional composition and TGF-{beta} effect in a mouse model of colitis, as well as the role of intestinal microbiota. MethodsMice were treated with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) during 5 days to induce colitis, until the inflammatory peak (day 7) or gut restitution (day 14). After DSS treatment, some of them received EEN formula such as Modulen IBD(R) (DM mice) or Infatrini Peptisorb(R) (DINF mice), with TGF-{beta} supplementation or neutralization, and clinical inflammation was evaluated. After sacrifice, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation were analyzed, as well as intestinal permeability (IP). The composition of mucosal colonic microbiota was analyzed and fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to evaluate its capacity to mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effect. Colonic crypts from DSS and EEN mice were cultured as 3D organoids and cellular properties were analyzed. ResultsDSS mice developed colitis, as evidenced by the weight loss and clinical inflammation. It was accompanied by macroscopic inflammation such as colon thickness and edemas, and an elevated IP. In contrast, EEN mice with TGF-{beta} formula present faster weight recovery and decreased inflammatory parameters, with a normalized IP, suggesting gut restitution and functionality. These functional improvements were not obtained for EEN mice without TGF-{beta} formula. Moreover, EEN with Modulen IBD(R) (DM mice) modified the microbiota in comparison to DSS condition and attenuated inflammation. In addition, the organoids from DM mice colonic crypts treated had an enhanced survival, and re-epithelialization capacity. ConclusionsBoth EEN formula have anti-inflammatory properties, certainly by the nutritional composition. However, TGF-{beta} plays a significant role in intestinal restitution and restoring barrier function. These beneficial effects are partly mediated by the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis.\nA neuronal circuit driven by GLP-1 in the olfactory bulb regulates insulin secretion\nAuthors: Montaner, M.; Denom, J.; Simon, V.; Jiang, W.; Holt, M. K.; Brierley, D.; Rouch, C.; Foppen, E.; Kassis, N.; Jarriault, D.; Khan, D.; Eygret, L.; Mifsud, F.; Hodson, D. J.; Broichhagen, J.; Van Oudenhove, L.; Fioramonti, X.; Gault, V.; Cota, D.; Reimann, F.; Gribble, F. M.; Migrenne-Li, S.; Trapp, S.; Gurden, H.; Magnan, C.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555086\nGlucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Shoes alter the evolved biomechanics of the foot, potentially affecting running kinematics and kinetics that can in turn influence injury and performance. An important feature of conventional running shoes is heel height, whose effects on foot and ankle biomechanics remain understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of 6 - 26 mm increases in heel height on ankle dynamics in 8 rearfoot strike runners who ran barefoot and in minimal shoes with added heels. We predicted higher heels would lead to greater frontal plane ankle torques due to the increased vertical moment arm of the mediolateral ground reaction force. Surprisingly, the torque increased in minimal shoes with no heel elevation, but then decreased with further increases in heel height due to changes in foot posture that are probably a strategy to compensate for potentially injurious ankle torques. We also found that increasing heel heights caused a large increase in the ankle plantarflexion velocity at heel strike, which we explain using a passive collision model. Our results highlight how running in minimal shoes may be significantly different from barefoot running due to complex interactions between proprioception and biomechanics that also permit runners to compensate for modifications to shoe design, more in the frontal than sagittal planes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ocean acidification (OA), a consequence of the increase in anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, causes major changes in the chemistry of carbonates in the ocean with deleterious effects on calcifying organisms. The pH/pCO2 range to which species are exposed in nature is important to consider when interpreting the response of coastal organisms to OA. In this context, emerging approaches, which assess the reaction norms of organisms to a wide pH gradient, are improving our understanding of tolerance thresholds and acclimation potential to OA. In this study, we decipher the reaction norms of two oyster species living in contrasting habitats: the intertidal oyster Crassostrea gigas and the subtidal flat oyster Ostrea edulis, which are two economically and ecologically valuable species in temperate ecosystems. Six-month-old oysters of each species were exposed in common garden for 48 days to a pH gradient ranging from 7.7 to 6.4 (total scale). Both species are tolerant down to a pH of 6.6 with high plasticity in fitness-related traits such as survival and growth. However, oysters undergo remodelling of membrane fatty acids to cope with decreasing pH along with shell bleaching impairing shell integrity and consequently animal fitness. Finally, our work reveals species-specific physiological responses and highlights that intertidal C. gigas seems to have a better acclimation potential to rapid and extreme OA changes than O. edulis. Overall, our study provides important data about the phenotypic plasticity and its limits in two oyster species, which is essential for assessing the challenges posed to marine organisms by OA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) comprises two subsegments, DCT1 and DCT2, with different functional and molecular characteristics. The functional and molecular distinction between these segments, however, has been controversial.

MethodsTo understand the heterogeneity within the DCT population with better clarity, we enriched for DCT nuclei by using a mouse line combining &#34;Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types&#34; and NCC (sodium chloride cotransporter)-driven inducible Cre recombinase. We sorted the fluorescently labeled DCT nuclei using Fluorescence-Activated Nucleus Sorting, and performed single nucleus transcriptomics.

ResultsAmong 25,183 DCT cells, 70% were from DCT1 and 30% from DCT2. Additionally, there was a small population (&lt;1%) enriched in proliferation-related genes, such asTop2a, Cenpp, and Mki67. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express NCC, magnesium transport genes are more abundant along DCT1; whereas calcium, electrogenic sodium and potassium transport genes are more abundant along DCT2. The transition between these two segments are gradual with a transitional zone where DCT1 and DCT2 cells are interspersed. The expression of the homeobox genes is not consistent between all DCT cells, suggesting that they develop along different trajectories.

ConclusionTranscriptomics analysis of an enriched rare cell population using genetically targeted approach offers better clarification of the function and classification. The DCT segment is short, yet, can be separated into two sub-types that serve distinct functions, and are speculated to derive from different origins during development.

Significance StatementHigh-resolution snRNAseq data indicate a clear separation between primary sites of calcium and magnesium handling within DCT. Both DCT1 and DCT2 express Slc12a3, but these subsegments serve distinctive functions, with more abundant magnesium handling genes along DCT1 and more calcium handling genes along DCT2. The data also provides insight into the plasticity of the distal nephron-collecting duct junction, formed from cells of separate embryonic origins. By focusing/changing gradients of gene expression, the DCT can morph into different physiological cell states on demand.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermogenic beige adipocytes are recognized as potential therapeutic targets for combating metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic advantages they offer are compromised with aging. Here, we show that treating mice with estrogen (E2), a hormone that decreases with age, to mice can counteract the aging- related decline in beige adipocyte formation when subjected to cold, while concurrently enhancing energy expenditure and improving glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, we find that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of E2-induced beige adipocytes, which subsequently suppresses the onset of age-related ER stress. Furthermore, we found that targeting NAMPT signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, can restore the formation of beige adipocytes by increasing the number of perivascular adipocyte progenitor cells. Conversely, the absence of NAMPT signaling prevents this process. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the mechanisms governing the age-dependent impairment of beige adipocyte formation and underscore the E2-NAMPT controlled ER stress as a key regulator of this process.

HighlightsO_LIEstrogen restores beige adipocyte failure along with improved energy metabolism in old mice.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the thermogenic gene program by mitigating age-induced ER stress.
C_LIO_LIEstrogen enhances the beige adipogenesis derived from SMA&#43; APCs.

        <p class="abstract">The investigation into the effects of cold acclimation on fish skeletal muscle function and its potential implications for muscle atrophy is of great interest to us. This study examines how rearing zebrafish at low temperatures affects their locomotor activity and the expression of genes associated with muscle atrophy. Zebrafish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 10 {degrees}C to 25 {degrees}C, and their swimming distance was measured. The expression levels of important muscle atrophy genes, Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were also evaluated. Our findings show that swimming activity significantly decreases when the water temperature ranges from 10 {degrees}C to 15 {degrees}C, indicating a decrease in voluntary movement. Additionally, gene expression analysis shows a significant increase in the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 at 10 {degrees}C. This up-regulation could lead to muscle atrophy caused by decreased activity in cold temperatures. To investigate the effects of exercise on reducing muscle atrophy, we subjected zebrafish to forced swimming at a temperature of 8 {degrees}C for ten days. This treatment significantly reduced the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, emphasizing the importance of muscle stimulation in preventing muscle atrophy in zebrafish. These findings suggest that zebrafish can serve as a valuable model organism for studying muscle atrophy and can be utilized in drug screening for muscle atrophy-related disorders. Cold-reared zebrafish provide a practical and ethical approach to inducing disuse muscle atrophy, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing skeletal muscle atrophy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glomeruli are the filtration units of the kidney and their function relies heavily on their microcirculation. Despite its obvious diagnostic importance, an accurate estimation of blood flow in the capillary bundle within glomeruli defies the resolution of conventional imaging modalities. Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has demonstrated its ability to image in-vivo deep organs in the body. Recently, the concept of sensing ULM or sULM was introduced to classify individual microbubble behavior based on the expected physiological conditions at the micrometric scale. In the kidney of both rats and humans, it revealed glomerular structures in 2D but was severely limited by planar projection. In this work, we aim to extend sULM in 3D to image the whole organ and in order to perform an accurate characterization of the entire kidney structure. The extension of sULM into the 3D domain allows better localization and more robust tracking. The 3D metrics of velocity and pathway angular shift made glomerular mask possible. This approach facilitated the quantification of glomerular physiological parameter such as an interior traveled distance of approximately 7.5 {&#43;/-} 0.6 microns within the glomerulus. This study introduces a technique that characterize the complete kidney phisiology which can serve as a method to facilite pathology assessment. Furthermore, its potential for clinical relevance could serve as a bridge between research and practical application, leading to innovative diagnostics and improved patient care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimsExclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the first line of treatment for pediatric Crohns disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We studied EEN nutritional composition and TGF-{beta} effect in a mouse model of colitis, as well as the role of intestinal microbiota.

MethodsMice were treated with Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) during 5 days to induce colitis, until the inflammatory peak (day 7) or gut restitution (day 14). After DSS treatment, some of them received EEN formula such as Modulen IBD(R) (DM mice) or Infatrini Peptisorb(R) (DINF mice), with TGF-{beta} supplementation or neutralization, and clinical inflammation was evaluated. After sacrifice, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation were analyzed, as well as intestinal permeability (IP). The composition of mucosal colonic microbiota was analyzed and fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to evaluate its capacity to mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effect. Colonic crypts from DSS and EEN mice were cultured as 3D organoids and cellular properties were analyzed.

ResultsDSS mice developed colitis, as evidenced by the weight loss and clinical inflammation. It was accompanied by macroscopic inflammation such as colon thickness and edemas, and an elevated IP. In contrast, EEN mice with TGF-{beta} formula present faster weight recovery and decreased inflammatory parameters, with a normalized IP, suggesting gut restitution and functionality. These functional improvements were not obtained for EEN mice without TGF-{beta} formula. Moreover, EEN with Modulen IBD(R) (DM mice) modified the microbiota in comparison to DSS condition and attenuated inflammation. In addition, the organoids from DM mice colonic crypts treated had an enhanced survival, and re-epithelialization capacity.

ConclusionsBoth EEN formula have anti-inflammatory properties, certainly by the nutritional composition. However, TGF-{beta} plays a significant role in intestinal restitution and restoring barrier function. These beneficial effects are partly mediated by the microbiota to maintain gut homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and holds significant pharmacological potential. Nevertheless, the regulation of energy homeostasis by centrally-produced GLP-1 remains partially understood. Preproglucagon cells, known to release GLP-1, are found in the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in the OB stimulates insulin secretion in response to oral glucose in lean and diet-induced obese mice. This is associated with reduced noradrenaline content in the pancreas and blocked by an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, highlighting the functional implication of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Inhibiting GABAA receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the control centre of the SNS, abolishes the enhancing effect on insulin secretion induced by OB GLP-1R. Therefore, OB GLP-1-dependent regulation of insulin secretion relies on a relay within the PVN. These findings identify a novel top-down neural mechanism engaged by OB GLP-1 signaling to control insulin secretion via the SNS.</p>
