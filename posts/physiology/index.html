J.; Gulbransen, B. D.; Veldhuis, N. A.; Poole, D. P.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574831\nBackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution. MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2+ imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays. ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2+ signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR+ cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2+ responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2+ signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro. ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility. SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility. C_LIO_LINew analysis methods were developed to examine cellular communication in the enteric glial network. This approach revealed new insights into inflammation-associated changes in glial connectivity. C_LIO_LINew roles for TRPV4 in transduction of distension-evoked responses in the colon and colonic motility were identified. C_LI Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2+ signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility. New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed. C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified. C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling. C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2+ signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation.

C.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.574247\nRationale: Obesity is characterized by impaired energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity-regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in ARC neurons in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity. Methods: We quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD). In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding-regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons. Results: Npas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC-NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks of HFD. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the significant reduction in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from AgRP neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates. Conclusions: Taken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell-autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.\nTime dependent changes in feeding behavior and energy balance associated with weight gain in mice fed obesogenic diets\nAuthors: Fathi, P. A.; Bales, M. B.; Ayala, J. E.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575043\nObesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.\nImpact of Capillary and Sarcolemmal Proximity on Mitochondrial Structure and Energetic Function in Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Parry, H. A.; Willingham, T. B.; Giordano, K. A.; Kim, Y.; Qazi, S.; Knutson, J. R.; Combs, C. A.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574684\nMitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.\nSweet and fatty symbionts: photosynthetic productivity and carbon storage boosted in microalgae within a host\nAuthors: Catacora Grundy, A.; Chevalier, F.; Yee, D.; LeKieffre, C.; Schieber, N.; Schwab, Y.; Gallet, B.; Jouneau, P.-H.; Curien, G.; Decelle, J.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572971\nSymbiosis between a host and intracellular eukaryotic microalgae is a widespread life strategy in aquatic ecosystems. This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis. Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.\nLate-life isoleucine restriction promotes physiological and molecular signatures of healthy aging\nAuthors: Yeh, C.-Y.; Chini, L. C. S.; Davidson, J. W.; Garcia, G. G.; Gallagher, M. S.; Freichels, I. T.; Calubag, M. F.; Rodgers, A. C.; Green, C. L.; Babygirija, R.; Sonsalla, M. M.; Pak, H. H.; Trautman, M.; Hacker, T. A.; Miller, R. A.; Simcox, J.; Lamming, D.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.06.527311\nIn defiance of the paradigm that calories from all sources are equivalent, we and others have shown that dietary protein is a dominant regulator of healthy aging. The restriction of protein or the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine promotes healthspan and extends lifespan when initiated in young or adult mice. However, many interventions are less efficacious or even deleterious when initiated in aged animals. Here, we investigate the physiological, metabolic, and molecular consequences of consuming a diet with a 67% reduction of all amino acids (Low AA), or of isoleucine alone (Low Ile), in male and female C57BL/6J.Nia mice starting at 20 months of age. We find that both diet regimens effectively reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance, which were benefits that were not mediated by reduced calorie intake. Both diets improve specific aspects of frailty, slow multiple molecular indicators of aging rate, and rejuvenate the aging heart and liver at the molecular level. These results demonstrate that Low AA and Low Ile diets can drive youthful physiological and molecular signatures, and support the possibility that these dietary interventions could help to promote healthy aging in older adults.\nMetformin protects the heart against chronic intermittent hypoxia through AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1α\nAuthors: Moulin, S.; Blachot-Minassian, B.; Kneppers, A.; Thomas, A.; Paradis, S.; Bultot, L.; Arnaud, C.; Pepin, J.-L.; Bertrand, L.; Mounier, R.; Belaidi, E.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575152\nChronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1a+/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPKa2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPKa2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1a nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1a phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPKa2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.\nIntermittent fasting promotes ILC3s secreting IL-22 contributing to the beigeing of white adipose tissue\nAuthors: Chen, H.; Sun, L.; Feng, L.; Han, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhai, W.; Zhang, Z.; Mulholland, M.; Zhang, W.; Yin, Y.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555436\nMechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.\nDecreased sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 impairs skeletal muscle mitochondrial function independently of insulin action in type 2 diabetes\nAuthors: Rizo-Roca, D.; Guimaraes, D. S.; Pendergrast, L. A.; Di Leo, N.; Chibalin, A. V.; Maqdasy, S.; Ryden, M.; Naslund, E.; Zierath, J. R.; Krook, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575194\nPlasma creatine levels are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Since skeletal muscle is the main disposal site of both creatine and glucose, we investigated the role of intramuscular creatine metabolism in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. We report in men with type 2 diabetes, plasma creatine levels are increased, while intramuscular phosphocreatine content is reduced. These alterations are coupled to reduced expression of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2). In C2C12 myotubes, Ckmt2 silencing reduced mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and glucose oxidation. Electroporation-mediated overexpression of Ckmt2 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-fed male mice increased mitochondrial respiration, independent of creatine availability. Thus, beyond the canonical role of CKMT2 on creatine phosphorylation, we reveal a previously underappreciated role of CKMT2 on mitochondrial homeostasis, independent of insulin action. Collectively, our data provides functional evidence into how CKMT2 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes.\nHuman Soluble Prorenin Receptor Expressed in Adipose Tissue Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Endothelial Function in Obese Female Mice\nAuthors: Arthur, G.; Ahmed, N.; Nichols, K.; Poupeau, A.; Collins, K.; Lindner, V.; Loria, A. S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575451\nIncreased circulating levels of the soluble prorenin receptor (sPRR), a component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), plays a role in obesity, glucose, and insulin homeostasis. However, elevated plasma sPRR in diabetic patients has been shown correlated with hyperglycemia in women but not men. Hence, the current study sought to understand the contribution of human sPRR (HsPRR) produced in the adipose tissue (Adi) on adipogenesis, and glucose and insulin balance in obesity settings. Adi-HsPRR mice were generated by breeding human sPRR-Myc-tag transgenic mice with mice expressing Adiponectin/Cre. The mouse model was validated by detecting 28kDa myc-tagged HsPRR by western blotting. Adipose HsPRR expression did not change circulating sPRR in female mice fed a standard chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) but increased plasma sPRR in male Adi-HsPRR mice fed a HFD compared to HFD-fed controls. Yet, Adi-HsPRR improved insulin sensitivity, vascular relaxation and the vasodilator agent Ang 1-7 in obese female mice but not in the male counterparts. Moreover, Adi-HsPRR expression reduced the expression of the adipogenic genes SREBP1C and CD36 only in gonadal white adipose from obese female mice, signifying that adipose tissue-derived HsPRR exerts a sex-specific effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function which seems independent of circulating sPRR.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMechanosensation is an important trigger of physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aberrant responses to mechanical input are associated with digestive disorders, including visceral hypersensitivity. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a mechanosensory ion channel with proposed roles in visceral afferent signaling, intestinal inflammation, and gut motility. While TRPV4 is a potential therapeutic target for digestive disease, current mechanistic understanding of how TRPV4 may influence gut function is limited by inconsistent reports of TRPV4 expression and distribution.

MethodsIn this study we profiled functional expression of TRPV4 using Ca2&#43; imaging of wholemount preparations of the mouse, monkey, and human intestine in combination with immunofluorescent labeling for established cellular markers. The involvement of TRPV4 in colonic motility was assessed in vitro using videomapping and contraction assays.

ResultsThe TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A evoked Ca2&#43; signaling in muscularis macrophages, enteric glia, and endothelial cells. TRPV4 specificity was confirmed using TRPV4 KO mouse tissue or antagonist pre-treatment. Calcium responses were not detected in other cell types required for neuromuscular signaling including enteric neurons, interstitial cells of Cajal, PDGFR&#43; cells, and intestinal smooth muscle. TRPV4 activation led to rapid Ca2&#43; responses by a subpopulation of glial cells, followed by sustained Ca2&#43; signaling throughout the enteric glial network. Propagation of these waves was suppressed by inhibition of gap junctions or Ca2&#43; release from intracellular stores. Coordinated glial signaling in response to GSK1016790A was also disrupted in acute TNBS colitis. The involvement of TRPV4 in the initiation and propagation of colonic motility patterns was examined in vitro.

ConclusionsWe reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRPV4 in the initiation of distension-evoked colonic motility. These observations provide new insights into the functional role of TRPV4 activation in the gut, with important implications for how TRPV4 may influence critical processes including inflammatory signaling and motility.

SummaryO_LITRPV4 is expressed by equivalent cell types in the rodent and primate (monkey and human) colon. This mechanosensitive ion channel has proposed roles in inflammation, visceral afferent signaling, and colonic motility.

Key findingsWe have defined the cell types that functionally express TRPV4 in the gut wall. These include enteric glia, endothelia of blood and lymphatic vessels, mMac, and extrinsic afferent nerves. TRPV4- dependent Ca2&#43; signaling was not detected in enteric neurons, PDGFR cells, interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscle cells, which are important drivers of gut motility. These observations align with our experimental evidence for limited involvement of TRPV4 in neuromuscular transmission and propagating colonic motility.

New and NoteworthyO_LINovel cellular sites of functional TRPV4 expression in the GI tract were identified and compared across multiple vertebrate species. New analytical approaches to characterize enteric glial communication in a spatiotemporal manner were developed.
C_LIO_LIA supporting role for TRPV4 in the initiation of propagating colonic contractions in response to distension was demonstrated. Potential mechanisms that contribute to TRPV4-mediated effects on GI function were identified.
C_LIO_LITRPV4-dependent activity in enteric glia is enhanced in inflammation, consistent with current evidence for inflammation-associated sensitization of TRPV4 on visceral afferents and a major role in mechanically evoked nociceptive signaling.
C_LIO_LIPair correlation analysis was used to examine spatial connectivity of Ca2&#43; signaling, enabling demonstration of dysregulated glial communication in acute inflammation.

        <p class="abstract">Rationale: Obesity is characterized by impaired energy balance and altered function of cell types that regulate food intake. These cell types include POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that detect peripheral signals and promote a reduction in food intake upon activation. Downstream of neuronal activation, activity-regulated genes such as Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) are induced as part of the response to environmental stimuli. Npas4 is known to have cytoprotective roles in both neurons and pancreatic beta cells. A previous Npas4 knockout study in both mouse pancreatic beta cells and ARC neurons implied a potential role of Npas4 in ARC neurons in regulating food intake. However, the specific sites of Npas4 action in the ARC are unknown. We hypothesized that Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC has a role in regulating food intake during obesity. Methods: We quantified Npas4 expression in POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus in mice exposed to various positive energy states known to activate POMC neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization. Next, we generated adult male mice with a conditional Npas4 knockout specifically in their ARC POMC neurons (POMC-NPAS4 KO) and metabolically characterized them for 30 weeks on regular chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD). In addition, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on microdissected ARC tissue and neighbouring regions from fasted or 1hr refed POMC-NPAS4 KO mice and controls at 6 weeks of HFD, in order to identify Npas4-regulated and feeding-regulated transcriptional changes in POMC neurons. Results: Npas4 was expressed in POMC neurons, and its expression was induced in response to positive energy states such as refeeding, oral glucose, and acute HFD feeding. HFD-fed POMC-NPAS4 KO males showed significantly reduced body weight starting at 10 weeks of HFD, and weighed 8-10 grams less than controls by 30 weeks of HFD. With metabolic cages and manual food intake measurements, we determined this difference was not the result of increased energy expenditure or activity, but was due to decreased food intake prior to the significant reduction in body weight. Using the ARC single-cell dataset, we found that POMC neurons of KO mice showed an enhanced refeeding-induced transcriptional response, dysregulated immediate early gene expression in response to refeeding, and reduced expression of genes encoding GABA-A receptor subunits. Furthermore, cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed that POMC neurons of KO mice specifically lost inhibitory GABAergic signaling inputs, some of which came from AgRP neurons, and gained excitatory glutamatergic signaling inputs compared to POMC neurons of control littermates. Conclusions: Taken together, the results suggest that activity-dependent expression of Npas4 in POMC neurons tempers the activity of these cells upon overnutrition. Loss of Npas4 causes cell-autonomous loss of the capacity to sense nutrient intake. Molecularly, this is driven by reduced expression of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and an overall increase in POMC neuronal activity, leading to decreased food intake and decreased weight gain. In conclusion, for the first time we report a role for the transcription factor Npas4 in POMC neurons of the ARC, and demonstrate it plays an indispensable role in controlling feeding behavior in states of overnutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is characterized by dysregulated homeostatic mechanisms resulting in positive energy balance, yet when this dysregulation occurs is unknown. We assessed the time course of alterations to behaviors promoting weight gain in male and female mice switched to obesogenic 60% or 45% high fat diet (HFD). Switching mice to obesogenic diets promotes transient bouts of hyperphagia during the first 2 weeks followed by persistent caloric hyperphagia. Energy expenditure increases but not sufficiently to offset increased caloric intake, resulting in a sustained net positive energy balance. Hyperphagia is associated with consumption of calorically larger meals (impaired satiation) more frequently (impaired satiety) particularly during the light-cycle. Running wheel exercise delays weight gain in 60% HFD-fed male mice by enhancing satiation and increasing energy expenditure. However, exercise effects on satiation are no longer apparent after 2 weeks, coinciding with weight gain. Thus, exposure to obesogenic diets engages homeostatic regulatory mechanisms for [~]2 weeks that ultimately fail, and consequent weight gain is characterized by impaired satiation and satiety. Insights into the etiology of obesity can be obtained by investigating changes to satiation and satiety mechanisms during the initial [~]2 weeks of HFD exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Symbiosis between a host and intracellular eukaryotic microalgae is a widespread life strategy in aquatic ecosystems. This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis.

Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In defiance of the paradigm that calories from all sources are equivalent, we and others have shown that dietary protein is a dominant regulator of healthy aging. The restriction of protein or the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine promotes healthspan and extends lifespan when initiated in young or adult mice. However, many interventions are less efficacious or even deleterious when initiated in aged animals. Here, we investigate the physiological, metabolic, and molecular consequences of consuming a diet with a 67% reduction of all amino acids (Low AA), or of isoleucine alone (Low Ile), in male and female C57BL/6J.Nia mice starting at 20 months of age. We find that both diet regimens effectively reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance, which were benefits that were not mediated by reduced calorie intake. Both diets improve specific aspects of frailty, slow multiple molecular indicators of aging rate, and rejuvenate the aging heart and liver at the molecular level. These results demonstrate that Low AA and Low Ile diets can drive youthful physiological and molecular signatures, and support the possibility that these dietary interventions could help to promote healthy aging in older adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major feature of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), is associated with a more severe myocardial infarction. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of cardiac samples from mice exposed to IH, which reveals a specific transcriptomic signature of the disease, relative to mitochondrial remodeling and cell death. Corresponding to its activation under chronic IH, we stabilized the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) in cardiac cells in vitro, and observed its association with an increased autophagic flux. In accordance, IH induced autophagy and mitophagy that is decreased in HIF-1a&#43;/_ mice compared to wild-type animals suggesting that HIF-1 plays a significant role in IH-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Next, we showed that the AMPK metabolic sensor, typically activated by mitochondrial stress, is inhibited after 3 weeks of IH in hearts. Therefore, we assessed the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug and potent activator of AMPK, on myocardial response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Daily administration of metformin significantly decreases infarct size without any systemic beneficial effect on insulin-resistance under IH conditions. The cardioprotective effect of metformin is lost in AMPKa2 knock-out mice demonstrating that AMPKa2 isoform promotes metformin-induced cardioprotection in mice exposed to IH. Mechanistically, we found that metformin inhibits IH-induced mitophagy in myocardium and decreases HIF-1a nuclear expression in mice subjected to IH. In vitro demonstrated that metformin induces HIF-1a phosphorylation, decreases its nuclear localization and subsequently HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these results identify the AMPKa2 metabolic sensor as a novel modulator of HIF-1 activity. Our data suggest that metformin could be considered as a cardioprotective drug in OSA patients independently of their metabolic status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plasma creatine levels are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Since skeletal muscle is the main disposal site of both creatine and glucose, we investigated the role of intramuscular creatine metabolism in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. We report in men with type 2 diabetes, plasma creatine levels are increased, while intramuscular phosphocreatine content is reduced. These alterations are coupled to reduced expression of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2). In C2C12 myotubes, Ckmt2 silencing reduced mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and glucose oxidation. Electroporation-mediated overexpression of Ckmt2 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-fed male mice increased mitochondrial respiration, independent of creatine availability. Thus, beyond the canonical role of CKMT2 on creatine phosphorylation, we reveal a previously underappreciated role of CKMT2 on mitochondrial homeostasis, independent of insulin action. Collectively, our data provides functional evidence into how CKMT2 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Increased circulating levels of the soluble prorenin receptor (sPRR), a component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), plays a role in obesity, glucose, and insulin homeostasis. However, elevated plasma sPRR in diabetic patients has been shown correlated with hyperglycemia in women but not men. Hence, the current study sought to understand the contribution of human sPRR (HsPRR) produced in the adipose tissue (Adi) on adipogenesis, and glucose and insulin balance in obesity settings. Adi-HsPRR mice were generated by breeding human sPRR-Myc-tag transgenic mice with mice expressing Adiponectin/Cre. The mouse model was validated by detecting 28kDa myc-tagged HsPRR by western blotting. Adipose HsPRR expression did not change circulating sPRR in female mice fed a standard chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) but increased plasma sPRR in male Adi-HsPRR mice fed a HFD compared to HFD-fed controls. Yet, Adi-HsPRR improved insulin sensitivity, vascular relaxation and the vasodilator agent Ang 1-7 in obese female mice but not in the male counterparts. Moreover, Adi-HsPRR expression reduced the expression of the adipogenic genes SREBP1C and CD36 only in gonadal white adipose from obese female mice, signifying that adipose tissue-derived HsPRR exerts a sex-specific effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function which seems independent of circulating sPRR.</p>
