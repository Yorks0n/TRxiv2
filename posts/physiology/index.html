We previously showed, in vivo, that platelet activation revealed by intracellular calcium mobilization was a crucial step in the growth of thrombi following laser-induced injury, a model of thromboinflammation. AimWe employed a multimodal, correlative microscopy approach and computational biology to investigate the extent of platelet activation and the spatial distribution of platelets throughout a growing thrombus. ResultsWe observed a reversible intracellular platelet calcium mobilization that correlates with the time a platelet resides during thrombus growth. Our bioinformatics analysis displayed three distinct platelet subpopulations resident within a thrombus: (1) resting, (2) partially activated, and (3) \"fully\" activated platelets. The spatial distribution of the platelet subpopulations in the thrombus creates a double gradient in both the transversal and longitudinal axis, with the maximal percentage of fully activated platelets close to the site of injury. However, these activated platelets did not express negative phospholipids. The injured endothelium was identified to play a vital role in activating the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thrombosis. ConclusionFollowing a laser-induced injury, thrombi are formed by a gradient of activated platelets from the injury site to the periphery of the thrombus. These different activation states of platelets throughout the thrombi regulate the biomechanics of the thrombus. The injured endothelium, rather than platelets, was identified to play a key role in the activation of the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thromboinflammation. EssentialsO_LIComputational biology was used to analyze thrombosis. C_LIO_LINon-activated, low- and fully-activated platelets are part of a thrombus.

A.; Knuteson, R. L.; Dewitt, E. D.; Eisman, R. C.; Nemkov, T.; D'Alessandro, A.; Tennessen, J. M.; Weaver, L. N.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553385\nThe ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.\nThe H3K27 acetyltransferase p300 is dispensable for thermogenic adipose tissue formation and function.\nAuthors: Gamu, D.; Cameron, M. S.; Gibson, W.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554499\nBrown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized for thermogenesis because it contains uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. BAT is also an endocrine organ, producing many signalling molecules important for regulating the metabolism of peripheral organs. Mounting evidence suggest that histone modifying enzymes are integral for the development, tissue maintenance, and postnatal functioning of brown and beige adipocytes. p300 and its functional homologue CREB-binding protein (CBP) are histone acetyltransferases that form the transcriptionally activating histone 3 acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac) mark. Using Ucp1-Cre, we examined the requirement of p300 activity specifically within thermogenic adipocytes. We hypothesized that loss of p300 activity would impair gene programming integral for BAT development/function, rendering knockouts susceptible to metabolic dysfunction and unable to form beige adipocytes. Despite successful knockdown, brown fat was completely unaffected by p300 deletion. As such, knockout mice showed a comparable metabolic profile to littermate controls in response to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, de novo beige adipogenesis within subcutaneous fat by a B3 adrenergic agonist remained intact in knockout mice. Although p300 and CBP have non-overlapping roles in other tissues, our results indicate p300 HAT activity is dispensable within thermogenic fats, likely due to functional compensation by CBP.\nPantothenate Kinase 4 controls efficient skeletal muscle energy substrate metabolism via acetyl-CoA\nAuthors: Miranda-Cervantes, A.; Fritzen, A.

D.; Sylow, L.; Kiens, B.; Richter, E.; Kleinert, M.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.551603\nMetabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.\nSerotonin therapies for opioid-induced dysphagia and respiratory depression: sex differences in a rat electromyography model\nAuthors: Frazure, M.; Morimoto, I.; Fielder, N.; Mellen, N.; Iceman, K.; Pitts, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554164\nOpioids are well-known to cause respiratory depression, but despite clinical evidence of dysphagia, the effects of opioids on swallow excitability and motor pattern are unknown. We sought to test the effects of the clinically-relevant opioid buprenorphine on pharyngeal swallow and respiratory drive in male and female rats. We also evaluated utility of serotonin 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and buspirone) to improve swallowing and breathing outcomes following buprenorphine administration. Experiments were performed on 44 freely breathing Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Bipolar fine wire electrodes were inserted into the mylohyoid, thyroarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, thyropharyngeus and diaphragm muscles to measure electromyographic (EMG) activity of swallowing and breathing behaviors. We evaluated the hypotheses that swallow varies by stimulus, opioids depress swallow and breathing, and that 5-HT1A agonists improve these depressions. Our results largely confirmed the hypotheses: 1) Swallow-related muscle activity was larger during swallows elicited by oral water infusion plus esophageal distension than by either stimulus alone. 2) Buprenorphine depressed swallow in both sexes, but most significantly in females. 3) Female animals were more susceptible to buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest. 4) 8-OH-DPAT rescued breathing following buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest, and pre-treatment with the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone prevented buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest in female animals. 5) 8- OH-DPAT enhanced swallow-related mylohyoid drive, but did not restore excitability of the swallow pattern generator following total suppression by buprenorphine. Our results highlight sex-specific and behavior-specific effects of buprenorphine and provide pre-clinical evidence of a 5HT1A agonist for the treatment of respiratory depression and dysphagia. New \u0026 NoteworthyThis is the first manuscript to evaluate sex-specific effects of opioid administration on pharyngeal swallow. We expand on a small but growing number of studies that report a lower threshold for opioid-induced respiratory depression in females than males, and are the first to produce this effect with the partial mu-opioid-receptor agonist buprenorphine. Our study is the first to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors can improve swallow and breathing outcomes following systemic buprenorphine administration.\nConfigural behavior response to a two component odor mixture\nAuthors: O'Brien, R. F.; Klymyshyn, D.; Cohen, L. B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.552323\nConfigural odors are mixtures of odorant molecules that are perceived as an odor distinct from the components. They provide an attractive target for investigations of odor perception in the olfactory bulb. We investigated the perception of octanal and citronellal in mice using a Go/No-Go behavioral paradigm, and show that mice trained on the mixture of the two odorants respond selectively to the mixture, but not to the components delivered separately.\nItaconate stabilizes CPT1a to enhance lipid utilization during inflammation\nAuthors: Mainali, R.; Buechler, N.; Ortero, C.; Edwards, L.; Key, C.-C.; Furdui, C.; Quinn, M. A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553243\nOne primary metabolic manifestation of inflammation is the diversion of cis-aconitate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to synthesize the immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing Irg1 knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed at understanding the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, Irg1 KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveal enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-ocytl itaconate (4-OI) treatment in vitro. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate Irg1 KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.\nLean female mice producing trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid present excessive fibroblast growth factor 21, adrenaline, prostaglandin E2, corticosterone, and glucagon\nAuthors: Rao, Y.; Liang, L.; Li, M.; Wang, Y.; Wang, B.; Gou, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.21.536206\nDietary trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) has been shown to induce white fat reduction. In this study, the transgenic mice that produce endogenous t10c12-CLA were used to determine the long-term impact of this substance on lipid metabolism in lean female mammals. Phenotype profiling showed that the t10c12-CLA did not induce fat loss but resulted in less heat release and oxygen consumption, as well as excessive adrenaline, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in either biallelic Pai/Pai or monoallelic Pai/wt mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the following effects of t10c12-CLA were genotype-specific. Pai/wt mice specifically exhibited increased chronic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and reduced physical activities. Contrarily, Pai/Pai mice showed the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), corticosterone, and glucagon, accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Further analysis of Pai/Pai livers revealed that the steatosis resulted from attenuated lipid metabolism via down-regulating phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase. Analysis of Pai/Pai brown adipose tissue indicated stimulated thermogenesis and lipolysis by up-regulating uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, and AMPK, as well as down-regulating phosphorylated AMPK. These results suggest that chronic t10c12-CLA may affect lipid metabolism by stimulating the overproduction of multiple hormones (FGF21, PEG2, adrenaline, etc.) in a dose-dependent manner in lean female mammals.\nSensory representations and pupil-indexed listening effort provide complementary contributions to multi-talker speech intelligibility\nAuthors: McHaney, J. R.; Hancock, K. E.; Polley, D. B.; Parthasarathy, A.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553131\nOptimal speech perception in noise requires successful separation of the target speech stream from multiple competing background speech streams. The ability to segregate these competing speech streams depends on the fidelity of bottom-up neural representations of sensory information in the auditory system and top-down influences of effortful listening. Here, we use objective neurophysiological measures of bottom-up temporal processing using envelope-following responses (EFRs) to amplitude modulated tones and investigate their interactions with pupil-indexed listening effort, as it relates to performance on the Quick speech in noise (QuickSIN) test in young adult listeners with clinically normal hearing thresholds. We developed an approach using ear-canal electrodes and adjusting electrode montages for modulation rate ranges, which extended the rage of reliable EFR measurements as high as 1024Hz. Pupillary responses revealed changes in listening effort at the two most difficult signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), but behavioral deficits at the hardest SNR only. Neither pupil-indexed listening effort nor the slope of the EFR decay function independently related to QuickSIN performance. However, a linear model using the combination of EFRs and pupil metrics significantly explained variance in QuickSIN performance. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bottom-up sensory coding and top-down measures of listening effort as it relates to speech perception in noise. These findings can inform the development of next-generation tests for hearing deficits in listeners with normal-hearing thresholds that incorporates a multi-dimensional approach to understanding speech intelligibility deficits.\nNitric Oxide modulates spontaneous Ca2+ release and ventricular arrhythmias during β adrenergic signalling through S-nitrosylation of Calcium/Calmodulin dependent kinase II\nAuthors: Power, A. S.; Asamudo, E.; Worthington, L. P.; Alim, C. C.; Parackal, R.; Wallace, R. S.; Ebenebe, O. V.; Heller Brown, J.; Kohr, M. J.; Bers, D. M.; Erickson, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554546\nRationale: Nitric oxide (NO) is a signalling molecule generated during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in the heart. A critical role for NO in spontaneous Ca2+ release via S nitrosylation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is emerging. NO donors are routinely used clinically for their cardioprotective effects in the heart, but it is unknown how NO donors modulate CaMKII to alter cardiac arrhythmia incidence. Objective: We tested the role of S-nitrosylation of a pair of regulatory sited on CaMKII{delta} in cardiac Ca2+ handling and arrhythmogenesis before and during {beta}-AR stimulation. Methods and Results: We measured Ca2+-handling in isolated cardiomyocytes from mice lacking CaMKII{delta} expression (CaMKII{delta}-KO) or with deletion of S-nitrosylation sites on CaMKII{delta} at Cys 273 or Cys-290A. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to NO donor, S nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; 150 {micro}M) and/or {beta} adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO; 100nM). Cardiomyocytes responded to ISO with a full inotropic and lusitropic Ca2+ transient response as well as increased Ca2+ spark frequency. However, the increase in Ca2+ spark frequency was significantly attenuated in CaMKII{delta}-KO cardiomyocytes. The protection from ISO-induced Ca2+ sparks and waves was mimicked by GSNO pre-treatment in WT cardiomyocytes, but lost in CaMKII{delta}-C273S cardiomyocytes that displayed a robust increase in Ca2+ waves. This observation is consistent with a critical role for CaMKII-C273 in limiting ISO-induced arrhythmogenic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak. When GSNO was applied after ISO this protection was not observed in WT or C273S but was seen in C290A-CaMKII. In Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts, GSNO pre-treatment limited ISO-induced arrhythmias in WT but not CaMKII{delta}-C273S hearts, while GSNO exposure after ISO sustained or exacerbated arrhythmic events. Conclusions: We conclude that prior S-nitrosylation of CaMKII? at Cys-273 can limit subsequent {beta}-AR induced arrhythmias, but that S-nitrosylation at Cys-290 might worsen or sustain ?-AR-induced arrhythmias. This has important implications for the administration of NO donors in the clinical setting.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe contribution of platelets in thrombosis within microcirculation has been extensively documented in the literature. We previously showed, in vivo, that platelet activation revealed by intracellular calcium mobilization was a crucial step in the growth of thrombi following laser-induced injury, a model of thromboinflammation.

AimWe employed a multimodal, correlative microscopy approach and computational biology to investigate the extent of platelet activation and the spatial distribution of platelets throughout a growing thrombus.

ResultsWe observed a reversible intracellular platelet calcium mobilization that correlates with the time a platelet resides during thrombus growth. Our bioinformatics analysis displayed three distinct platelet subpopulations resident within a thrombus: (1) resting, (2) partially activated, and (3) &#34;fully&#34; activated platelets. The spatial distribution of the platelet subpopulations in the thrombus creates a double gradient in both the transversal and longitudinal axis, with the maximal percentage of fully activated platelets close to the site of injury. However, these activated platelets did not express negative phospholipids. The injured endothelium was identified to play a vital role in activating the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thrombosis.

ConclusionFollowing a laser-induced injury, thrombi are formed by a gradient of activated platelets from the injury site to the periphery of the thrombus. These different activation states of platelets throughout the thrombi regulate the biomechanics of the thrombus. The injured endothelium, rather than platelets, was identified to play a key role in the activation of the blood coagulation cascade in this model of thromboinflammation.

        <p class="abstract">The ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system has been beneficial in addressing key biological questions. Current modifications of this methodology to temporally induce transgene expression require temperature changes or exposure to exogenous compounds, both of which have been shown to have detrimental effects on physiological processes. The recently described auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES) utilizes the plant hormone auxin to induce transgene expression and is proposed to be the least toxic compound for genetic manipulation, with no obvious effects on Drosophila development and survival. Here we show that auxin exposure in adult Drosophila induces observable changes in physiology and feeding behavior. We found that there is a dosage response to adult survival upon auxin exposure and low auxin concentrations alter feeding activity. Furthermore, auxin fed male and female flies exhibit a significant decrease in triglyceride levels and display altered transcription of fatty acid metabolism genes. Although fatty acid metabolism is disrupted, auxin does not significantly impact adult female fecundity or progeny survival, suggesting AGES may be an ideal methodology for studying limited biological processes. These results emphasize that experiments using temporal binary systems must be carefully designed and controlled for to avoid confounding effects and misinterpretation of results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized for thermogenesis because it contains uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. BAT is also an endocrine organ, producing many signalling molecules important for regulating the metabolism of peripheral organs. Mounting evidence suggest that histone modifying enzymes are integral for the development, tissue maintenance, and postnatal functioning of brown and beige adipocytes. p300 and its functional homologue CREB-binding protein (CBP) are histone acetyltransferases that form the transcriptionally activating histone 3 acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac) mark. Using Ucp1-Cre, we examined the requirement of p300 activity specifically within thermogenic adipocytes. We hypothesized that loss of p300 activity would impair gene programming integral for BAT development/function, rendering knockouts susceptible to metabolic dysfunction and unable to form beige adipocytes. Despite successful knockdown, brown fat was completely unaffected by p300 deletion. As such, knockout mice showed a comparable metabolic profile to littermate controls in response to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, de novo beige adipogenesis within subcutaneous fat by a B3 adrenergic agonist remained intact in knockout mice. Although p300 and CBP have non-overlapping roles in other tissues, our results indicate p300 HAT activity is dispensable within thermogenic fats, likely due to functional compensation by CBP.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle (SkM) is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise improves metabolic flexibility, rendering it a valuable discovery tool of mechanisms promoting efficient metabolism of glucose and lipids. We herein discover pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) as a conserved exercise target with high abundance in SkM. We go on to show that murine muscle Pank4 is dysregulated with high-fat diet feeding, and identify human PANK4 variants that associate with glycemic control and body mass index traits, indicating important roles of PanK4 in glucose metabolism and growth. Consistent with the latter, germline deletion of PanK4 reduces circulating IGF-1 and stunts growth in mice. Deletion specifically in mouse SkM reveals that PanK4 facilitates fatty acid oxidation by acting as a regulator of SkM acetyl-CoA, a key node in metabolism of both glucose and lipids. Consequently, without PanK4, elevated SkM acetyl-CoA levels allosterically gridlock key enzymes required for efficient lipid and glucose utilization, and these SkM metabolic perturbations manifest in whole-body insulin resistance. As proof of principle, we show that an increase in muscle PanK4 lowers SkM acetyl-CoA and increases SkM glucose utilization. Our findings identify PanK4 as a novel regulator of SkM energy substrate metabolism, warranting inclusion in comprehensive strategies against metabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Opioids are well-known to cause respiratory depression, but despite clinical evidence of dysphagia, the effects of opioids on swallow excitability and motor pattern are unknown. We sought to test the effects of the clinically-relevant opioid buprenorphine on pharyngeal swallow and respiratory drive in male and female rats. We also evaluated utility of serotonin 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and buspirone) to improve swallowing and breathing outcomes following buprenorphine administration. Experiments were performed on 44 freely breathing Sprague Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Bipolar fine wire electrodes were inserted into the mylohyoid, thyroarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, thyropharyngeus and diaphragm muscles to measure electromyographic (EMG) activity of swallowing and breathing behaviors. We evaluated the hypotheses that swallow varies by stimulus, opioids depress swallow and breathing, and that 5-HT1A agonists improve these depressions. Our results largely confirmed the hypotheses: 1) Swallow-related muscle activity was larger during swallows elicited by oral water infusion plus esophageal distension than by either stimulus alone. 2) Buprenorphine depressed swallow in both sexes, but most significantly in females. 3) Female animals were more susceptible to buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest. 4) 8-OH-DPAT rescued breathing following buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest, and pre-treatment with the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone prevented buprenorphine-induced respiratory arrest in female animals. 5) 8- OH-DPAT enhanced swallow-related mylohyoid drive, but did not restore excitability of the swallow pattern generator following total suppression by buprenorphine. Our results highlight sex-specific and behavior-specific effects of buprenorphine and provide pre-clinical evidence of a 5HT1A agonist for the treatment of respiratory depression and dysphagia.

New &amp; NoteworthyThis is the first manuscript to evaluate sex-specific effects of opioid administration on pharyngeal swallow. We expand on a small but growing number of studies that report a lower threshold for opioid-induced respiratory depression in females than males, and are the first to produce this effect with the partial mu-opioid-receptor agonist buprenorphine. Our study is the first to demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors can improve swallow and breathing outcomes following systemic buprenorphine administration.</p>

They provide an attractive target for investigations of odor perception in the olfactory bulb. We investigated the perception of octanal and citronellal in mice using a Go/No-Go behavioral paradigm, and show that mice trained on the mixture of the two odorants respond selectively to the mixture, but not to the components delivered separately.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One primary metabolic manifestation of inflammation is the diversion of cis-aconitate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to synthesize the immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing Irg1 knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed at understanding the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, Irg1 KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveal enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-ocytl itaconate (4-OI) treatment in vitro. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate Irg1 KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) has been shown to induce white fat reduction. In this study, the transgenic mice that produce endogenous t10c12-CLA were used to determine the long-term impact of this substance on lipid metabolism in lean female mammals. Phenotype profiling showed that the t10c12-CLA did not induce fat loss but resulted in less heat release and oxygen consumption, as well as excessive adrenaline, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in either biallelic Pai/Pai or monoallelic Pai/wt mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the following effects of t10c12-CLA were genotype-specific. Pai/wt mice specifically exhibited increased chronic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and reduced physical activities. Contrarily, Pai/Pai mice showed the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), corticosterone, and glucagon, accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Further analysis of Pai/Pai livers revealed that the steatosis resulted from attenuated lipid metabolism via down-regulating phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase. Analysis of Pai/Pai brown adipose tissue indicated stimulated thermogenesis and lipolysis by up-regulating uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, and AMPK, as well as down-regulating phosphorylated AMPK. These results suggest that chronic t10c12-CLA may affect lipid metabolism by stimulating the overproduction of multiple hormones (FGF21, PEG2, adrenaline, etc.) in a dose-dependent manner in lean female mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Optimal speech perception in noise requires successful separation of the target speech stream from multiple competing background speech streams. The ability to segregate these competing speech streams depends on the fidelity of bottom-up neural representations of sensory information in the auditory system and top-down influences of effortful listening. Here, we use objective neurophysiological measures of bottom-up temporal processing using envelope-following responses (EFRs) to amplitude modulated tones and investigate their interactions with pupil-indexed listening effort, as it relates to performance on the Quick speech in noise (QuickSIN) test in young adult listeners with clinically normal hearing thresholds. We developed an approach using ear-canal electrodes and adjusting electrode montages for modulation rate ranges, which extended the rage of reliable EFR measurements as high as 1024Hz. Pupillary responses revealed changes in listening effort at the two most difficult signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), but behavioral deficits at the hardest SNR only. Neither pupil-indexed listening effort nor the slope of the EFR decay function independently related to QuickSIN performance. However, a linear model using the combination of EFRs and pupil metrics significantly explained variance in QuickSIN performance. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bottom-up sensory coding and top-down measures of listening effort as it relates to speech perception in noise. These findings can inform the development of next-generation tests for hearing deficits in listeners with normal-hearing thresholds that incorporates a multi-dimensional approach to understanding speech intelligibility deficits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rationale: Nitric oxide (NO) is a signalling molecule generated during {beta}-adrenergic stimulation in the heart. A critical role for NO in spontaneous Ca2&#43; release via S nitrosylation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is emerging. NO donors are routinely used clinically for their cardioprotective effects in the heart, but it is unknown how NO donors modulate CaMKII to alter cardiac arrhythmia incidence. Objective: We tested the role of S-nitrosylation of a pair of regulatory sited on CaMKII{delta} in cardiac Ca2&#43; handling and arrhythmogenesis before and during {beta}-AR stimulation. Methods and Results: We measured Ca2&#43;-handling in isolated cardiomyocytes from mice lacking CaMKII{delta} expression (CaMKII{delta}-KO) or with deletion of S-nitrosylation sites on CaMKII{delta} at Cys 273 or Cys-290A. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to NO donor, S nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; 150 {micro}M) and/or {beta} adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO; 100nM). Cardiomyocytes responded to ISO with a full inotropic and lusitropic Ca2&#43; transient response as well as increased Ca2&#43; spark frequency. However, the increase in Ca2&#43; spark frequency was significantly attenuated in CaMKII{delta}-KO cardiomyocytes. The protection from ISO-induced Ca2&#43; sparks and waves was mimicked by GSNO pre-treatment in WT cardiomyocytes, but lost in CaMKII{delta}-C273S cardiomyocytes that displayed a robust increase in Ca2&#43; waves. This observation is consistent with a critical role for CaMKII-C273 in limiting ISO-induced arrhythmogenic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2&#43; leak. When GSNO was applied after ISO this protection was not observed in WT or C273S but was seen in C290A-CaMKII. In Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts, GSNO pre-treatment limited ISO-induced arrhythmias in WT but not CaMKII{delta}-C273S hearts, while GSNO exposure after ISO sustained or exacerbated arrhythmic events. Conclusions: We conclude that prior S-nitrosylation of CaMKII? at Cys-273 can limit subsequent {beta}-AR induced arrhythmias, but that S-nitrosylation at Cys-290 might worsen or sustain ?-AR-induced arrhythmias. This has important implications for the administration of NO donors in the clinical setting.</p>
