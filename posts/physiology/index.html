This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis. Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.\nImpact of Capillary and Sarcolemmal Proximity on Mitochondrial Structure and Energetic Function in Skeletal Muscle\nAuthors: Parry, H. A.; Willingham, T. B.; Giordano, K. A.; Kim, Y.; Qazi, S.; Knutson, J. R.; Combs, C. A.; Glancy, B.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574684\nMitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.\nEffects of aging on glucose and lipid metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lien, E. C.; Vu, N.; Westermark, A. M.; Danai, L. V.; Lau, A. N.; Gultekin, Y.; Kukurugya, M. A.; Bennett, B. D.; Vander Heiden, M.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572088\nAging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD+, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD+ regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD+-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD+/NADH during healthy aging.\nCardiac Localized Polycystin-2 plays a Functional Role in Natriuretic Peptide Production and its Absence Contributes to Hypertension\nAuthors: Elliott, B.; Marquez-Nogueraz, K. M.; Thuo, P.; DiNello, E.; Knutila, R. M.; Fritzmann, G. E.; Willis, M.; Chapman, A. B.; Cao, Q.; Barefield, D. Y.; Kuo, I. Y.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573922\nCardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hypertension is seen in 70% of patients by the age of 30 prior to decline in kidney function. The natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released by cardiomyocytes in response to membrane stretch, increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. Mice heterozygous for Pkd2 have attenuated NP responses and we hypothesized that cardiomyocyte-localized polycystin proteins contribute to production of NPs. Cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out models of polycystin-2 (PC2), one of the causative genes of ADPKD, demonstrate diurnal hypertension. These mice have decreased ANP and BNP expression in the left ventricle. Analysis of the pathways involved in production, maturation, and activity of NPs identified decreased transcription of CgB, PCSK6, and NFAT genes in cPC2-KOs. Engineered heart tissue with human iPSCs driven into cardiomyocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 KO of PKD2 failed to produce ANP. These results suggest that PC2 in cardiomyocytes are involved in NP production and lack of cardiac PC2 predisposes to a hypertensive volume expanded phenotype, which may contribute to the development of hypertension in ADPKD.\nCharacterization of the skeletal muscle arginine methylome in health and disease reveals remodeling in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nAuthors: Wong, J.; Blazev, R.; Ng, Y.-K.; Goodman, C.

L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574551\nArginine methylation is a protein post-translational modification important for the development of skeletal muscle mass and function. Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of arginine methylation under settings of health and disease remains largely undefined. Here, we investigated the regulation of arginine methylation in skeletal muscles in response to exercise and hypertrophic growth, and in diseases involving metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We report a limited regulation of arginine methylation under physiological settings that promote muscle health, such as during growth and acute exercise, nor in disease models of insulin resistance. In contrast, we saw a significant remodeling of asymmetric dimethylation in models of atrophy characterized by the loss of innervation, including in muscle biopsies from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome and asymmetric arginine dimethylome of skeletal muscle from individuals with ALS revealed the largest compendium of protein changes with the identification of 793 regulated proteins, and novel site-specific changes in asymmetric dimethyl arginine (aDMA) of key sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins. Finally, we show that in vivo overexpression of PRMT1 and aDMA resulted in increased fatigue resistance and functional recovery in mice. Our study provides evidence for asymmetric dimethylation as a regulator of muscle pathophysiology, and we present a valuable proteomics resource and rationale for numerous methylated and non-methylated proteins, including PRMT1, to be pursued for therapeutic development in ALS.\nConnexin43 in mesenchymal lineage cells regulates body adiposity and energy metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lee, S.-Y.; Fontana, F.; Sugatani, T.; Portales-Castillo, I.; Leanza, G.; Coler-Reilly, A.; Civitelli, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574415\nConnexin43 (Cx43) is the most abundant gap junction protein present in the mesenchymal lineage. In mature adipocytes, Cx43 mediates white adipose tissue (WAT) \"beiging\" in response to cold exposure and maintains the mitochondrial integrity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). We found that genetic deletion of Gja1 (Cx43 gene) in cells that give rise to chondro-osteogenic and adipogenic precursors driven by the Dermo1/Twist2 promoter leads to lower body adiposity and partial protection against the weight gain and metabolic syndrome induced by a high fat diet (HFD) in both sexes. These protective effects from obesogenic diet are related to increased locomotion, fuel utilization, energy expenditure, non-shivering thermogenesis, and better glucose tolerance in conditionally Gja1 ablated mice. Accordingly, Gja1 mutant mice exhibit reduced adipocyte hypertrophy, partially preserved insulin sensitivity, increased BAT lipolysis and decreased whitening under HFD. This metabolic phenotype is not reproduced with more restricted Gja1 ablation in differentiated adipocytes, suggesting that Cx43 has a hitherto unknown function in adipocyte progenitors or other targeted cells, resulting in restrained energy expenditures and fat accumulation. These results disclose an hitherto unknown action of Cx43 in adiposity, and offer a promising new pharmacologic target for improving metabolic balance in diabetes and obesity.

T.; Vinu, M.; Zorgit, S.; Zhou, F.; Wagner, L.; Idaghdour, Y.; Yule, D. I.; Feske, S.; Lacruz, R. S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574702\nSjogrens disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth), lymphocytic infiltration into salivary glands and the presence of SSA and SSB autoantibodies. Xerostomia is caused by hypofunction of the salivary glands and has been involved in the development of SjD. Saliva production is regulated by parasympathetic input into the glands initiating intracellular Ca2+ signals that activate the store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway eliciting sustained Ca2+ influx. SOCE is mediated by the STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and the ORAI1 Ca2+ channel. However, there are no studies on the effects of lack of STIM1/2 function in salivary acini in animal models and its impact on SjD. Here we report that male and female mice lacking Stim1 and Stim2 (Stim1/2K14Cre) in salivary glands showed reduced intracellular Ca2+ levels via SOCE in parotid acini and hyposalivate upon pilocarpine stimulation. Bulk RNASeq of the parotid glands of Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed a decrease in the expression of Stim1/2 but no other Ca2+ associated genes mediating saliva fluid secretion. SOCE was however functionally required for the activation of the Ca2+ activated chloride channel ANO1. Despite hyposalivation, ageing Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the glands or elevated levels of SSA or SSB autoantibodies in the serum, which may be linked to the downregulation of the toll-like receptor 8 (Tlr8). By contrast, salivary gland biopsies of SjD patients showed increased STIM1 and TLR8 expression, and induction of SOCE in a salivary gland cell line increased the expression of TLR8. Our data demonstrate that SOCE is an important activator of ANO1 function and saliva fluid secretion in salivary glands. They also provide a novel link between SOCE and TLR8 signaling which may explain why loss of SOCE does not result in SjD.\nFish Blood Response to Ash-Induced Environmental Alkalinization, and their Implications to Wildfire-Scarred Watersheds\nAuthors: Kwan, G. T.; Sanders, T.; Huang, S.; Kilaghbian, K.; Sam, C.; Wang, J.; Weihrauch, K.; Wilson, R. W.; Fangue, N. A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574400\nChanges in land use, warming climate and increased drought have amplified wildfire frequency and magnitude globally. Ash mixing into aquatic systems after wildfires rapidly increases water pH, creating an additional threat to wildlife, especially species that are already threatened, endangered and/or migratory. Here, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) yearlings acclimated to 15 or 20{degrees}C were exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of ash (0.25% w/v) which caused water pH to rapidly rise from [~]8.1 to [~]9.2. Mortalities occurred within the first 12 hours, and was higher at the higher temperature (33 versus 20 %). The greatest differences in blood chemistry between the two temperatures were dramatically greater ([~]7.5-fold) and very rapid (within 1 hour) spikes in both plasma total ammonia (to [~]1200 {micro}M) and lactate (to [~]6 mM) in warm-acclimated salmon, whereas cold-acclimated salmon experienced a much smaller and gradual rise in plasma total ammonia. Salmon at both temperatures experienced extracellular and intracellular alkalosis within 1 hour that recovered within 24 hours, but the alkalosis was smaller in magnitude in fish at warmer temperature. Impacts on plasma ion concentrations were relatively mild and plasma glucose increased by 2- to 4-fold at both temperatures. Notably, the increase in plasma total ammonia in fish at the warmer temperature was far faster and much greater than those reported in previous studies exposing fish despite higher water pH (9.4-10.5) induced without using ash. This suggests that ash has physiological impacts that cannot be explained by high water pH alone which may relate to the complex mixture of metals and organic compounds also released from ash. This demonstrates post-wildfire ash input can induce lethal yet previously unexplored physiological disturbances in fish and highlights the complex interaction with warmer temperatures typical of wildfire-scarred landscapes.\n3D-Printable Non-invasive Head Immobilization System for Non-Human Primates\nAuthors: Shahbazi, E.; Swedan, T.; Ma, T.; Lafer-Sousa, R.; Azadi, R.; Nguyen, D.; Ryan, A.; Afraz, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573832\nWe introduce a novel 3D-printed non-invasive head immobilization system (NHIS) for macaque monkeys, addressing the limitations of traditional head fixation methods in behavioral experiments. Traditional techniques, crucial for precise eye movement tracking and neural recording, often lead to biological complications like infection and bone softening. Our innovative NHIS, designed using CT/MRI scans and custom software FLoRIN, offers a tailored, comfortable fit for each subject. It accommodates essential experimental equipment such as eye-tracking and physiological monitoring devices, providing a more adaptable and efficient alternative for nonhuman primate research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Symbiosis between a host and intracellular eukaryotic microalgae is a widespread life strategy in aquatic ecosystems. This partnership is considered to be mainly energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy of microalgal symbionts. A major question is whether microalgae increase their photosynthetic production and decrease carbon storage in order to maximize carbon translocation to their host. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging and physiological analyses, we show that the photosynthetic machinery (chloroplast and CO2-fixing pyrenoid) of the symbiotic microalga Micractinium conductrix significantly expands inside their host (the ciliate Paramecium bursaria) compared to the free-living state. This is accompanied by a 13-fold higher quantity of Rubisco enzymes and 16-fold higher carbon fixation rate. Time-resolved subcellular imaging revealed that photosynthetically-derived carbon is first allocated to starch during the day, with five times higher production in symbiosis despite low growth. Nearly half of the carbon stored in starch is consumed overnight and some accumulates in lipid droplets, which are 20-fold more voluminous in symbiotic microalgae. We also show that carbon is transferred to the host and hypothesize that much of this is respired by the high density of surrounding host mitochondria. We provide evidence that the boosted photosynthetic production of symbiotic microalgae could be explained by the energetic demands of the host. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented view of the subcellular remodeling and dynamics of carbon metabolism of microalgae inside a host, highlighting the potentially key role of the source-sink relationship in aquatic photosymbiosis.

Significance statementSymbiotic interactions between a heterotrophic host and intracellular microalgae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems and are considered to be energized by the photosynthetically-derived carbon energy. However, little is known on the impact of symbiosis on the algal bioenergetics (e.g. carbon production and storage). This study reveals the morphological and physiological changes of a microalga inside a host at the subcellular scale over the day. We show that the photosynthetic machinery expands and carbon fixation and storage are boosted in symbiotic microalgae beyond their growth needs. This high photosynthetic production is very likely enhanced by the host energetic demands. Our findings advance our basic understanding of photosymbiosis and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and drivers of metabolic exchange between partners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondria within skeletal muscle cells are considered to be located either between the muscle contractile apparatus (interfibrillar mitochondria, IFM) or in large pools beneath the cell membrane (subsarcolemmal mitochondria, SSM), with several structural and functional differences reported between IFM and SSM. However, recent 3D imaging studies suggest that proximity to capillaries embedded in sarcolemmal grooves, rather than proximity to the sarcolemma itself, may drive the accumulation of mitochondria near the cell periphery (paravascular mitochondria, PVM). To evaluate the impact of capillary versus sarcolemmal proximity, we compared the structure and function of skeletal muscle mitochondria located either in large pools lateral to embedded capillaries (PVM), adjacent to the sarcolemma but not in PVM pools (SSM), or interspersed between sarcomeres (IFM). Mitochondrial morphology and interactions were assessed by 3D electron microscopy coupled with machine learning segmentation while mitochondrial energy conversion was assessed by two-photon microscopy of mitochondrial membrane potential, content, calcium, NADH redox and flux in live, intact cells. Structurally, while PVM and SSM were similarly larger than IFM, PVM were more compact and had greater mitochondrial connectivity compared to both IFM and SSM. Functionally, PVM had similar or greater basal NADH flux compared to SSM and IFM, respectively, despite a more oxidized NADH pool and a greater membrane potential, signifying a greater activation of the electron transport chain in PVM. Together, these data indicate proximity to capillaries has a greater impact on mitochondrial energy conversion and distribution in skeletal muscle than the sarcolemma alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is accompanied by multiple molecular changes that contribute to aging-associated pathologies, such as accumulation of cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Tissue metabolism can also change with age, in part because mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism. Moreover, the co-factor NAD&#43;, which is reported to decline across multiple tissue types during aging, plays a central role in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. To further characterize how tissue metabolism changes with age, we intravenously infused [U-13C]-glucose into young and old C57BL/6J, WSB/EiJ, and Diversity Outbred mice to trace glucose fate into downstream metabolites within plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and brain tissues. We found that glucose incorporation into central carbon and amino acid metabolism was robust during healthy aging across these different strains of mice. We also observed that levels of NAD&#43;, NADH, and the NAD&#43;/NADH ratio were unchanged in these tissues with healthy aging. However, aging tissues, particularly brain, exhibited evidence of up-regulated fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism reactions that regenerate NAD&#43; from NADH. Because mitochondrial respiration, a major source of NAD&#43; regeneration, is reported to decline with age, our data supports a model where NAD&#43;-generating lipid metabolism reactions may buffer against changes in NAD&#43;/NADH during healthy aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hypertension is seen in 70% of patients by the age of 30 prior to decline in kidney function. The natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released by cardiomyocytes in response to membrane stretch, increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. Mice heterozygous for Pkd2 have attenuated NP responses and we hypothesized that cardiomyocyte-localized polycystin proteins contribute to production of NPs. Cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out models of polycystin-2 (PC2), one of the causative genes of ADPKD, demonstrate diurnal hypertension. These mice have decreased ANP and BNP expression in the left ventricle. Analysis of the pathways involved in production, maturation, and activity of NPs identified decreased transcription of CgB, PCSK6, and NFAT genes in cPC2-KOs. Engineered heart tissue with human iPSCs driven into cardiomyocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 KO of PKD2 failed to produce ANP. These results suggest that PC2 in cardiomyocytes are involved in NP production and lack of cardiac PC2 predisposes to a hypertensive volume expanded phenotype, which may contribute to the development of hypertension in ADPKD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arginine methylation is a protein post-translational modification important for the development of skeletal muscle mass and function. Despite this, our understanding of the regulation of arginine methylation under settings of health and disease remains largely undefined. Here, we investigated the regulation of arginine methylation in skeletal muscles in response to exercise and hypertrophic growth, and in diseases involving metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We report a limited regulation of arginine methylation under physiological settings that promote muscle health, such as during growth and acute exercise, nor in disease models of insulin resistance. In contrast, we saw a significant remodeling of asymmetric dimethylation in models of atrophy characterized by the loss of innervation, including in muscle biopsies from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mass spectrometry-based quantification of the proteome and asymmetric arginine dimethylome of skeletal muscle from individuals with ALS revealed the largest compendium of protein changes with the identification of 793 regulated proteins, and novel site-specific changes in asymmetric dimethyl arginine (aDMA) of key sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins. Finally, we show that in vivo overexpression of PRMT1 and aDMA resulted in increased fatigue resistance and functional recovery in mice. Our study provides evidence for asymmetric dimethylation as a regulator of muscle pathophysiology, and we present a valuable proteomics resource and rationale for numerous methylated and non-methylated proteins, including PRMT1, to be pursued for therapeutic development in ALS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connexin43 (Cx43) is the most abundant gap junction protein present in the mesenchymal lineage. In mature adipocytes, Cx43 mediates white adipose tissue (WAT) &#34;beiging&#34; in response to cold exposure and maintains the mitochondrial integrity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). We found that genetic deletion of Gja1 (Cx43 gene) in cells that give rise to chondro-osteogenic and adipogenic precursors driven by the Dermo1/Twist2 promoter leads to lower body adiposity and partial protection against the weight gain and metabolic syndrome induced by a high fat diet (HFD) in both sexes. These protective effects from obesogenic diet are related to increased locomotion, fuel utilization, energy expenditure, non-shivering thermogenesis, and better glucose tolerance in conditionally Gja1 ablated mice. Accordingly, Gja1 mutant mice exhibit reduced adipocyte hypertrophy, partially preserved insulin sensitivity, increased BAT lipolysis and decreased whitening under HFD. This metabolic phenotype is not reproduced with more restricted Gja1 ablation in differentiated adipocytes, suggesting that Cx43 has a hitherto unknown function in adipocyte progenitors or other targeted cells, resulting in restrained energy expenditures and fat accumulation. These results disclose an hitherto unknown action of Cx43 in adiposity, and offer a promising new pharmacologic target for improving metabolic balance in diabetes and obesity.

        <p class="abstract">Sjogrens disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth), lymphocytic infiltration into salivary glands and the presence of SSA and SSB autoantibodies. Xerostomia is caused by hypofunction of the salivary glands and has been involved in the development of SjD. Saliva production is regulated by parasympathetic input into the glands initiating intracellular Ca2&#43; signals that activate the store operated Ca2&#43; entry (SOCE) pathway eliciting sustained Ca2&#43; influx. SOCE is mediated by the STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and the ORAI1 Ca2&#43; channel. However, there are no studies on the effects of lack of STIM1/2 function in salivary acini in animal models and its impact on SjD. Here we report that male and female mice lacking Stim1 and Stim2 (Stim1/2K14Cre) in salivary glands showed reduced intracellular Ca2&#43; levels via SOCE in parotid acini and hyposalivate upon pilocarpine stimulation. Bulk RNASeq of the parotid glands of Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed a decrease in the expression of Stim1/2 but no other Ca2&#43; associated genes mediating saliva fluid secretion. SOCE was however functionally required for the activation of the Ca2&#43; activated chloride channel ANO1. Despite hyposalivation, ageing Stim1/2K14Cre mice showed no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the glands or elevated levels of SSA or SSB autoantibodies in the serum, which may be linked to the downregulation of the toll-like receptor 8 (Tlr8). By contrast, salivary gland biopsies of SjD patients showed increased STIM1 and TLR8 expression, and induction of SOCE in a salivary gland cell line increased the expression of TLR8. Our data demonstrate that SOCE is an important activator of ANO1 function and saliva fluid secretion in salivary glands. They also provide a novel link between SOCE and TLR8 signaling which may explain why loss of SOCE does not result in SjD.</p>

Here, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) yearlings acclimated to 15 or 20{degrees}C were exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of ash (0.25% w/v) which caused water pH to rapidly rise from [~]8.1 to [~]9.2. Mortalities occurred within the first 12 hours, and was higher at the higher temperature (33 versus 20 %). The greatest differences in blood chemistry between the two temperatures were dramatically greater ([~]7.5-fold) and very rapid (within 1 hour) spikes in both plasma total ammonia (to [~]1200 {micro}M) and lactate (to [~]6 mM) in warm-acclimated salmon, whereas cold-acclimated salmon experienced a much smaller and gradual rise in plasma total ammonia. Salmon at both temperatures experienced extracellular and intracellular alkalosis within 1 hour that recovered within 24 hours, but the alkalosis was smaller in magnitude in fish at warmer temperature. Impacts on plasma ion concentrations were relatively mild and plasma glucose increased by 2- to 4-fold at both temperatures. Notably, the increase in plasma total ammonia in fish at the warmer temperature was far faster and much greater than those reported in previous studies exposing fish despite higher water pH (9.4-10.5) induced without using ash. This suggests that ash has physiological impacts that cannot be explained by high water pH alone which may relate to the complex mixture of metals and organic compounds also released from ash. This demonstrates post-wildfire ash input can induce lethal yet previously unexplored physiological disturbances in fish and highlights the complex interaction with warmer temperatures typical of wildfire-scarred landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce a novel 3D-printed non-invasive head immobilization system (NHIS) for macaque monkeys, addressing the limitations of traditional head fixation methods in behavioral experiments. Traditional techniques, crucial for precise eye movement tracking and neural recording, often lead to biological complications like infection and bone softening. Our innovative NHIS, designed using CT/MRI scans and custom software FLoRIN, offers a tailored, comfortable fit for each subject. It accommodates essential experimental equipment such as eye-tracking and physiological monitoring devices, providing a more adaptable and efficient alternative for nonhuman primate research.</p>
