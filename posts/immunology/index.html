Despite their essential role as a primary line of defense, neutrophils can contribute to tissue damage and age-related diseases 1 and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts all causes of mortality in the elderly 2-5. However, the precise mechanisms driving enhanced neutrophil generation during ageing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a subset of CD4+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype (CD4+ CTLs) producing the chemokine CCL5 and harbouring dysfunctional mitochondria, infiltrate the bone marrow and induce granulopoiesis in aged mice. During ageing, hematopoietic stem cells upregulate CCR5, the primary receptor for CCL5, and its deficiency limits the T cell-mediated induction of granulopoiesis and neutrophil output. Treatment with the FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc decreases granulopoiesis and lowers the levels of circulatory and tissue-infiltrating neutrophils, ameliorating multiple ageing biomarkers and improving functional outcomes in aged mice. These findings suggest that age-associated alterations in T cells reduce health outcomes by remodelling the bone marrow niche and enhancing neutrophil generation. Consequently, interventions to disrupt the interplay between T cells and hematopoietic stem cells hold substantial therapeutic potential to ameliorate age-associated diseases.\nIn silico assessment of immune cross protection between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2\nAuthors: Beirao, B. C. B.; Querne, L. B.; Zettel Bastos, F.; Adur, M. d. A.; Cavalheiro, V. L.\nScore: 161.3, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577193\nBackgroundHumans have long shared infectious agents with cattle, and the bovine-derived human common cold OC-43 CoV is a not-so-distant example of cross-species viral spill over of coronaviruses. Human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is certainly common, as the virus is endemic in most high-density cattle-raising regions. Since BCoVs are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that cross-protection against COVID-19 occurs in people exposed to BCoV. MethodsThis article shows an in silico investigation of human cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 due to BCoV exposure. We determined HLA recognition and human B lymphocyte reactivity to BCoV epitopes using bioinformatics resources. A retrospective geoepidemiological analysis of COVID-19 was then performed to verify if BCoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-protection could have occurred in the field. Brazil was used as a model for the epidemiological analysis of the impact of livestock density - as a proxy for human exposure to BCoV - on the prevalence of COVID-19 in people. ResultsAs could be expected from their classification in the same Betacoronavirus genus, we show that several human B and T epitopes are shared between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2. This raised the possibility of cross-protection of people from exposure to the bovine coronavirus. Analysis of field data added partial support to the hypothesis of viral cross-immunity from human exposure to BCoV. There was a negative correlation between livestock geographical density and COVID-19. Whole-Brazil data showed areas in the country in which COVID-19 prevalence was disproportionally low (controlled by normalization by transport infrastructure). Areas with high cattle density had lower COVID-19 prevalence in these low-risk areas. ConclusionsThese data are hypothesis-raising indications that cross-protection is possibly being induced by human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus.\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the nasal compartment\nAuthors: Kar, M.; Johnson, K. E. E.; Vanderheiden, A.; Elrod, E. J.; Floyd, K.; Geerling, E.; Stone, E. T.; Salinas, E.; Banakis, S.; Wang, W.; Sathish, S.; Shrihari, S.; Davis-Gardner, M. E.; Kohlmeier, J.; Pinto, A.; Klein, R.; Grakoui, A.; Ghedin, E.; Suthar, M. S.\nScore: 66.9, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576505\nSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and continues to pose a significant public health threat throughout the world. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are rapidly generated to form effector and memory cells and persist in the blood for several months. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection within the respiratory tract are not well understood. Using C57BL/6 mice infected with a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.351), we evaluated the role of T cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Following infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B. Using antibodies to deplete T cells prior to infection, we found that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play distinct roles in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the lungs, T cells play a minimal role in viral control with viral clearance occurring in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days post-infection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent and culturable virus replicating in the nasal compartment through 28 days post-infection. Using in situ hybridization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted in the nasal epithelial layer of tandem CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted mice. Sequence analysis of virus isolates from persistently infected mice revealed mutations spanning across the genome, including a deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCD4 T Cells Acquire Cytotoxic Properties to Modulate Cellular Senescence and Aging\nAuthors: Elyahu, Y.; Feygin, I.; Pinkas, N.; Zemer, A.; Shicht, A.; Berner, O.; Eremenko, E.; Nemirovsky, A.; Reshef, K.; Roitman, L.; Krizhanovsky, V.; Monsonego, A.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575313\nAging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.\nLearning predictive signatures of HLA type from T-cell repertoires\nAuthors: Ortega, M. R.; Pogorelyy, M.; Minervina, A.; Thomas, P.; Walczak, A.; Mora, T.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577228\nT cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with pep-tides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.\nRegulatory T cells control type 1-driven immunopathology restraining GM-CSF-producing helper T cells\nAuthors: Costa-Pereira, S.; Lanzinger, M.; Andreadou, M.; Nunez, N.; Villar-Vesga, J.; Prisco, F.; Hane, P.; Roussel, E.; Krishnarajah, S.; Lindemann, R. C.; Westermann, F.; Oberbichler, L.; Sethi, A.; Fonseca, A.; Pinzger, M.; Tugues, S.; Mundt, S.; Kipar, A.; Greter, M.; De Feo, D.; Becher, B.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577048\nRegulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Treg cell depletion or dysfunction rapidly results in fatal multiorgan inflammation linked to unrestrained effector T cell expansion, but the cytokine network underlying immunopathology, and its direct cellular mediators, remain elusive. Here, we combined gene targeting, fate-mapping tools, and high-dimensional cytometry to identify the T helper (TH) cell-derived cytokines and responding cells that execute inflammatory tissue damage upon global loss of peripheral tolerance in mice. We found that TH cell-derived GM-CSF, but not IL-17A, directed the ensuing immunopathology and thereby mortality through recruitment of tissue-invading phagocytes and granulocytes, and enhancement of their reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic proficiency. Our study highlights the critical role of Treg cells in controlling GM-CSF- producing TH cells and type 1-responses to restrain phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction and provides a framework for the use of anti-GM-CSF therapies in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders.\nHybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 arises from serological recall of IgG antibodies distinctly imprinted by infection or vaccination\nAuthors: Voss, W.

C.\nScore: 78.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576742\nWe used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (\"hybrid immunity\"). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with \u003e60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD \u003c 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 [~]0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.

Here, we integrated clonal kinetics with transcriptomic heterogeneity resolved by single-cell omics to explore cellular dynamics response of both non-transduced (CARneg) and transduced (CARpos)T-cells. CARneg and CARposT-cells were longitudinally interrogated in the manufactured infusion product (IP) and in-vivo at CAR-T cell expansion peak in five B-ALL patients treated with CD19CAR-T-cells (varni-cel). Significant differences were found in the cellular dynamics between CARpos and CARnegT-cells in response to therapy. CARposT-cells in the IP exhibited a significant higher CD4:CD8 ratio than CARnegT-cells, and the CD4:CD8 CARposT-cell composition impacted therapy outcome as confirmed in a larger cohort of 24 varni-cel-treated B-ALL patients. Conversely, an inverted trend in the CD4:CD8 CARposT-cell ratio was consistently observed at the expansion peak, with clonally expanding CD8+ effector memory and cytotoxic T-cells being the most abundant populations. Expanded cytotoxic CARpos{gamma}{delta}T cells emerged at the expansion peak, and the extent of their in-vivo expansion positively correlated with treatment efficacy, which was validated in a large cohort of B-ALL patients (n=18) treated with varni-cell and B-cell lymphoma patients (n=58) treated with either lisa-cel or axi-cel. Our data provide insights into the complexity and diversity of T-cell responses following CAR-T cell therapy and suggest drivers of immunotherapy response.\nSingle-cell transcriptomics reveals colonic immune perturbations during amyloid-β driven Alzheimer's disease in mice\nAuthors: Makhijani, P.; Emani, R.; Aguirre, C.

However, immunological mechanisms underlying this axis remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the colon immune compartment in the 5XFAD amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) mouse model, we uncovered AD-associated changes in ribosomal activity, oxidative stress, and BCR/plasma cell activity. Strikingly, levels of colon CXCR4+ antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were significantly reduced. This corresponded with accumulating CXCR4+ B cells and gut-specific IgA+ cells in the brain and dura mater, respectively. Consistently, a chemokine ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, was expressed at higher levels in 5XFAD glial cells and in in silico analyzed human brain studies, supporting altered neuroimmune trafficking. An inulin prebiotic fiber diet attenuated AD markers including A{beta} plaques and overall frailty. These changes corresponded to an expansion of gut IgA+ cells and rescued peripheral Tregs levels. Our study points to a key glia-gut axis and potential targets against AD. Study HighlightsO_LIAD is associated with altered immune parameters in the gut of 5XFAD mice. C_LIO_LI5XFAD colon has reduced ASCs, including CXCR4+ cells with a migratory gene signature. C_LIO_LI5XFAD brain gliosis includes increased CXCL12 expression.

C.; Looney, M. R.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577129\nAntibodies can initiate lung injury in a variety of disease states such as autoimmunity, transfusion reactions, or after organ transplantation, but the key factors determining in vivo pathogenicity of injury-inducing antibodies are unclear. A previously overlooked step in complement activation by IgG antibodies has been elucidated involving interactions between IgG Fc domains that enable assembly of IgG hexamers, which can optimally activate the complement cascade. Here, we tested the in vivo relevance of IgG hexamers in a complement-dependent alloantibody model of acute lung injury. We used three approaches to block alloantibody hexamerization (antibody carbamylation, the K439E Fc mutation, or treatment with domain B from Staphylococcal protein A), all of which reduced acute lung injury. Conversely, Fc mutations promoting spontaneous hexamerization made a harmful alloantibody into a more potent inducer of acute lung injury and rendered an innocuous alloantibody pathogenic. Treatment with a recombinant Fc hexamer decoy therapeutic protected mice from lung injury, including in a model with transgenic human FCGR2A expression that exacerbated pathology. These results indicate a direct in vivo role of IgG hexamerization in initiating acute lung injury and the potential for therapeutics that inhibit or mimic hexamerization to treat antibody-mediated diseases. Brief summaryIgG antibodies can form hexamers. This study shows that hexamer assembly is an important event determining the ability of IgG to trigger acute lung injury.

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in the blood, with numbers further increasing with age. Despite their essential role as a primary line of defense, neutrophils can contribute to tissue damage and age-related diseases 1 and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts all causes of mortality in the elderly 2-5. However, the precise mechanisms driving enhanced neutrophil generation during ageing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a subset of CD4&#43; T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype (CD4&#43; CTLs) producing the chemokine CCL5 and harbouring dysfunctional mitochondria, infiltrate the bone marrow and induce granulopoiesis in aged mice. During ageing, hematopoietic stem cells upregulate CCR5, the primary receptor for CCL5, and its deficiency limits the T cell-mediated induction of granulopoiesis and neutrophil output. Treatment with the FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc decreases granulopoiesis and lowers the levels of circulatory and tissue-infiltrating neutrophils, ameliorating multiple ageing biomarkers and improving functional outcomes in aged mice. These findings suggest that age-associated alterations in T cells reduce health outcomes by remodelling the bone marrow niche and enhancing neutrophil generation. Consequently, interventions to disrupt the interplay between T cells and hematopoietic stem cells hold substantial therapeutic potential to ameliorate age-associated diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHumans have long shared infectious agents with cattle, and the bovine-derived human common cold OC-43 CoV is a not-so-distant example of cross-species viral spill over of coronaviruses. Human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is certainly common, as the virus is endemic in most high-density cattle-raising regions. Since BCoVs are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that cross-protection against COVID-19 occurs in people exposed to BCoV.

MethodsThis article shows an in silico investigation of human cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 due to BCoV exposure. We determined HLA recognition and human B lymphocyte reactivity to BCoV epitopes using bioinformatics resources. A retrospective geoepidemiological analysis of COVID-19 was then performed to verify if BCoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-protection could have occurred in the field. Brazil was used as a model for the epidemiological analysis of the impact of livestock density - as a proxy for human exposure to BCoV - on the prevalence of COVID-19 in people.

ResultsAs could be expected from their classification in the same Betacoronavirus genus, we show that several human B and T epitopes are shared between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2. This raised the possibility of cross-protection of people from exposure to the bovine coronavirus. Analysis of field data added partial support to the hypothesis of viral cross-immunity from human exposure to BCoV. There was a negative correlation between livestock geographical density and COVID-19. Whole-Brazil data showed areas in the country in which COVID-19 prevalence was disproportionally low (controlled by normalization by transport infrastructure). Areas with high cattle density had lower COVID-19 prevalence in these low-risk areas.

ConclusionsThese data are hypothesis-raising indications that cross-protection is possibly being induced by human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and continues to pose a significant public health threat throughout the world. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells are rapidly generated to form effector and memory cells and persist in the blood for several months. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection within the respiratory tract are not well understood. Using C57BL/6 mice infected with a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.351), we evaluated the role of T cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Following infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B. Using antibodies to deplete T cells prior to infection, we found that CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells play distinct roles in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the lungs, T cells play a minimal role in viral control with viral clearance occurring in the absence of both CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells through 28 days post-infection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, but not individually, results in persistent and culturable virus replicating in the nasal compartment through 28 days post-infection. Using in situ hybridization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted in the nasal epithelial layer of tandem CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cell-depleted mice. Sequence analysis of virus isolates from persistently infected mice revealed mutations spanning across the genome, including a deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with pep-tides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Treg cell depletion or dysfunction rapidly results in fatal multiorgan inflammation linked to unrestrained effector T cell expansion, but the cytokine network underlying immunopathology, and its direct cellular mediators, remain elusive. Here, we combined gene targeting, fate-mapping tools, and high-dimensional cytometry to identify the T helper (TH) cell-derived cytokines and responding cells that execute inflammatory tissue damage upon global loss of peripheral tolerance in mice. We found that TH cell-derived GM-CSF, but not IL-17A, directed the ensuing immunopathology and thereby mortality through recruitment of tissue-invading phagocytes and granulocytes, and enhancement of their reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic proficiency. Our study highlights the critical role of Treg cells in controlling GM-CSF- producing TH cells and type 1-responses to restrain phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction and provides a framework for the use of anti-GM-CSF therapies in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (&#34;hybrid immunity&#34;). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with &gt;60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD &lt; 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 [~]0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.

{blacksquare}Immunological imprinting varies between infection (S2/NTD) and vaccination (RBD)

        <p class="abstract">How phenotypic, clonal, and functional heterogeneity of CAR-T-cells impact clinical outcomes remain understudied. Here, we integrated clonal kinetics with transcriptomic heterogeneity resolved by single-cell omics to explore cellular dynamics response of both non-transduced (CARneg) and transduced (CARpos)T-cells. CARneg and CARposT-cells were longitudinally interrogated in the manufactured infusion product (IP) and in-vivo at CAR-T cell expansion peak in five B-ALL patients treated with CD19CAR-T-cells (varni-cel). Significant differences were found in the cellular dynamics between CARpos and CARnegT-cells in response to therapy. CARposT-cells in the IP exhibited a significant higher CD4:CD8 ratio than CARnegT-cells, and the CD4:CD8 CARposT-cell composition impacted therapy outcome as confirmed in a larger cohort of 24 varni-cel-treated B-ALL patients. Conversely, an inverted trend in the CD4:CD8 CARposT-cell ratio was consistently observed at the expansion peak, with clonally expanding CD8&#43; effector memory and cytotoxic T-cells being the most abundant populations. Expanded cytotoxic CARpos{gamma}{delta}T cells emerged at the expansion peak, and the extent of their in-vivo expansion positively correlated with treatment efficacy, which was validated in a large cohort of B-ALL patients (n=18) treated with varni-cell and B-cell lymphoma patients (n=58) treated with either lisa-cel or axi-cel. Our data provide insights into the complexity and diversity of T-cell responses following CAR-T cell therapy and suggest drivers of immunotherapy response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The &#34;gut-brain axis&#34; is emerging as an important target in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immunological mechanisms underlying this axis remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the colon immune compartment in the 5XFAD amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) mouse model, we uncovered AD-associated changes in ribosomal activity, oxidative stress, and BCR/plasma cell activity. Strikingly, levels of colon CXCR4&#43; antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were significantly reduced. This corresponded with accumulating CXCR4&#43; B cells and gut-specific IgA&#43; cells in the brain and dura mater, respectively. Consistently, a chemokine ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, was expressed at higher levels in 5XFAD glial cells and in in silico analyzed human brain studies, supporting altered neuroimmune trafficking. An inulin prebiotic fiber diet attenuated AD markers including A{beta} plaques and overall frailty. These changes corresponded to an expansion of gut IgA&#43; cells and rescued peripheral Tregs levels. Our study points to a key glia-gut axis and potential targets against AD.

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies can initiate lung injury in a variety of disease states such as autoimmunity, transfusion reactions, or after organ transplantation, but the key factors determining in vivo pathogenicity of injury-inducing antibodies are unclear. A previously overlooked step in complement activation by IgG antibodies has been elucidated involving interactions between IgG Fc domains that enable assembly of IgG hexamers, which can optimally activate the complement cascade. Here, we tested the in vivo relevance of IgG hexamers in a complement-dependent alloantibody model of acute lung injury. We used three approaches to block alloantibody hexamerization (antibody carbamylation, the K439E Fc mutation, or treatment with domain B from Staphylococcal protein A), all of which reduced acute lung injury. Conversely, Fc mutations promoting spontaneous hexamerization made a harmful alloantibody into a more potent inducer of acute lung injury and rendered an innocuous alloantibody pathogenic. Treatment with a recombinant Fc hexamer  decoy therapeutic protected mice from lung injury, including in a model with transgenic human FCGR2A expression that exacerbated pathology. These results indicate a direct in vivo role of IgG hexamerization in initiating acute lung injury and the potential for therapeutics that inhibit or mimic hexamerization to treat antibody-mediated diseases.

Brief summaryIgG antibodies can form hexamers. This study shows that hexamer assembly is an important event determining the ability of IgG to trigger acute lung injury.
