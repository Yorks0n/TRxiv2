  "articleBody": " Humoral immune responses to the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA booster\nAuthors: Marking, U.; Bladh, O.; Aguilera, K.; Yang, Y.; Greilert-Norin, N.; Blom, K.; Hober, S.; Klingstrom, J.; Havervall, S.; Aberg, M.; Sheward, D. J.; Thalin, C.\nScore: 99.4, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572575\nContinued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly. Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were. Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.\nIron deficiency in people with obesity drives defective natural killer cell mitochondrial fitness and function\nAuthors: DeBarra, C.; Ryan, E.; Sugrue, M.; Ryan, O.; Lynn, E.; Heneghan, H. M.; McCarthy, C.; Moynagh, P. N.; Sinclair, L. V.; Jones, N.; Hogan, A.; O Shea, D.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575005\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.\nLack of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34 in regulatory T cells leads to a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder without affecting their development\nAuthors: Courreges, C. J.; Davenport, E. C.; Bilanges, B.; Rebollo-Gomez, E.; Hukelmann, J.; Schoenfelder, P.; Edgar, J. R.; Sansom, D.; Scudamore, C.; Roychoudhuri, R.; Garden, O. A.; Vanhaesebroeck, B.; Okkenhaug, K.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574346\nRegulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for the maintenance of immunological tolerance, yet the molecular components required for their maintenance and effector functions remain incompletely defined. Inactivation of VPS34 in Treg cells led to an early, lethal phenotype, with massive effector T cell activation and inflammation, like mice lacking Treg cells completely. However, VPS34-deficient Treg cells developed normally, populated the peripheral lymphoid organs and effectively supressed conventional T cells in vitro. Our data suggest that VPS34 is required for the maturation of Treg cells or that mature Treg cells depend on VPS34 for survival. Functionally, we observed that lack of VPS34 activity impairs cargo processing upon transendocytosis, that defective autophagy contributes to, but is not sufficient to explain this lethal phenotype, and that loss of VPS34 activity induces a state of heightened metabolic activity that may interfere with metabolic networks required for maintenance or suppressive functions of Treg cells.\nA mass cytometry approach to track the evolution of T cell responses during infection and immunotherapy by paired T cell receptor repertoire and T cell differentiation state analysis\nAuthors: Castillo, J. G.; DeBarge, R.; Mende, A.; Tenvooren, I.; Marquez, D. M.; Straub, A.; Busch, D. H.; Spitzer, M. H.; DuPage, M.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575237\nT cell receptor (TCR) recognition followed by clonal expansion is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses. Here, we developed a mass cytometric (CyTOF) approach combining antibodies specific for different TCR V- and V{beta}-chains with antibodies against T cell activation and differentiation proteins to identify antigen-specific expansions of T cell subsets and assess aspects of cellular function. This strategy allowed for the identification of expansions of specific V{beta} and V chain expressing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with varying differentiation states in response to Listeria monocytogenes, tumors, and respiratory influenza infection. Expanded V{beta} chain expressing T cells could be directly linked to the recognition of specific antigens from Listeria, tumor cells, or influenza. In the setting of influenza infection, we showed that the common therapeutic approaches of intramuscular vaccination or convalescent serum transfer altered the clonal diversity and differentiation state of responding T cells. Thus, we present a new method to monitor broad changes in TCR specificity paired with T cell differentiation during adaptive immune responses.\nTranslation initiation or elongation inhibition triggers contrasting effects on Caenorhabditis elegans survival during pathogen infection\nAuthors: Ghosh, A.; Singh, J.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575653\nDiverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.\nAspergillus-mediated allergic airway inflammation is triggered by dendritic cell recognition of a defined spore morphotype, a process that can be targeted via antifungal therapeutics.\nAuthors: Houlder, E. L.; Gago, S.; Vere, G.; Conn, D.; Khan, S.; Thomson, D.; Shepherd, M.; Lebedinec, R.; Brown, G. D.; Bromley, M.; MacDonald, A. S.; Cook, P. C.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575032\nBackgroundExposure to fungi, especially Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.), can elicit potent allergic inflammation that triggers and worsens asthmatic disease. Dendritic cells (DCs), initiate allergic inflammatory responses to allergic stimuli. However, it is unclear if A.f. spores during isotropic growth (early spore swelling) can activate DCs to initiate allergic responses or if germination is required. This lack of basic understanding of how A.f. causes disease is a barrier to the development of new treatments. ObjectiveTo show that a precise A.f. morphotype stage during spore swelling can trigger DCs to mediate allergic inflammatory responses and ascertain if antifungal therapeutics can be effective at suppressing this process. MethodsWe employed an A.f. strain deficient in pyrimidine biosynthesis ({Delta}pyrG) to generate populations of A.f. spores arrested at different stages of isotropic growth (swelling) via temporal removal of uracil and uridine from growth media. These arrested spore stages were cultured with bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs), and their activation measured via flow cytometry and ELISA to interrogate which growth stage was able to activate BMDCs. These BMDCs were then adoptively transferred into the airways, to assess if they were able to mediate allergic inflammation in naive recipient mice. Allergic airway inflammation in vivo was determined via flow cytometry, ELISA and qPCR. This system was also used to determine if antifungal drug (itraconazole) treatment could alter early stages of spore swelling and therefore BMDC activation and in vivo allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. ResultsWe found that A.f. isotropic growth is essential to trigger BMDC activation and mediate allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, using time arrested A.f. stages, we found that least 3h in growth media enabled spores to swell sufficiently to activate BMDCs to elicit allergic airway inflammation in vivo. Incubation of germinating A.f. with itraconazole reduced spore swelling and partially reduced their ability to activate BMDCs to elicit in vivo allergic airway inflammation. ConclusionIn summary, our results have pinpointed the precise stage of A.f. development when germinating spores are able to activate DCs to mediate downstream allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we have identified that antifungal therapeutics can be effective in reducing the potential of A.f. spores to stimulate allergic responses, highlighting a potential mechanism by which antifungal treatment might help to prevent the development of fungal allergy.\nMultimodal profiling reveals tissue-directed signatures of human immune cells altered with age\nAuthors: Wells, S.

A.; Jones, J. L.; Yosef, N.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573877\nThe immune system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.\nCD4 T Cells Acquire Cytotoxic Properties to Modulate Cellular Senescence and Aging\nAuthors: Elyahu, Y.; Feygin, I.; Pinkas, N.; Zemer, A.; Shicht, A.; Berner, O.; Eremenko, E.; Nemirovsky, A.; Reshef, K.; Roitman, L.; Krizhanovsky, V.; Monsonego, A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575313\nAging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.\nIntestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine-induced T cell responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2\nAuthors: Desai, P.; Karl, C. E.; Ying, B.; Liang, C.-Y.; Garcia-Salum, T.; Santana, A. C.; Caten, F. T.; Urban, J. F.; Elbashir, S. M.; Edwards, D. K.; Ribeiro, S. P.; Thackray, L. B.; Sekaly, R.-P. K.; Diamond, M. S.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575588\nAlthough vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nCD271 restrains the B1b cell antibody response in a T cell dependent manner\nAuthors: Lebel, M.-E.; Bonkoungou, C. A.; Thibault, J.; Rauch, J.; Alugupalli, K. R.; Melichar, H. J.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574733\nCo-signaling molecules modulate T cell function and are essential to control the duration and amplitude of immune responses. These molecules belong to the immunoglobulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamilies and have been extensively studied; however, the immunomodulatory role of several family members remains unknown. We show that CD271 (also known as p75 or NGFR), a TNFR superfamily member, is highly expressed on peritoneal B1 B cells, but not on conventional (B2) B cells at steady state. CD271 expression by B cells specifically restrains the response to T cell-independent type 2 antigens (TI-2). B1 cell-expressed CD271 maintains peritoneal CD4+ T cell quiescence, and augmented antibody responses to TI-2 antigens in CD271-deficient mice are dependent on CD4+ T cells. This increase in antibody production correlates with improved bacterial neutralization in vitro and survival after bacterial challenge in vivo. Further, our results suggest that CD271 can directly inhibit mouse and human T cell activity to the same extent as PD-L1, a known, negative regulator of T cell function. These results establish CD271 as a co-inhibitory molecule that could be targeted to improve the efficacy of vaccines against pathogenic encapsulated bacteria and to broadly modulate the T cell response in therapeutic contexts. eTOC summaryLebel et al. identify an unexpected role for CD271, a neurotrophin receptor, in directly inhibiting T cell function. B1 cell-expressed CD271 maintains CD4+ T cell quiescence; in the absence of CD271, T cells bolster antibody production to T-independent antigens, enhancing the response to encapsulated bacteria.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly.

Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were.

Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for the maintenance of immunological tolerance, yet the molecular components required for their maintenance and effector functions remain incompletely defined. Inactivation of VPS34 in Treg cells led to an early, lethal phenotype, with massive effector T cell activation and inflammation, like mice lacking Treg cells completely. However, VPS34-deficient Treg cells developed normally, populated the peripheral lymphoid organs and effectively supressed conventional T cells in vitro.

Our data suggest that VPS34 is required for the maturation of Treg cells or that mature Treg cells depend on VPS34 for survival. Functionally, we observed that lack of VPS34 activity impairs cargo processing upon transendocytosis, that defective autophagy contributes to, but is not sufficient to explain this lethal phenotype, and that loss of VPS34 activity induces a state of heightened metabolic activity that may interfere with metabolic networks required for maintenance or suppressive functions of Treg cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cell receptor (TCR) recognition followed by clonal expansion is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses. Here, we developed a mass cytometric (CyTOF) approach combining antibodies specific for different TCR V- and V{beta}-chains with antibodies against T cell activation and differentiation proteins to identify antigen-specific expansions of T cell subsets and assess aspects of cellular function. This strategy allowed for the identification of expansions of specific V{beta} and V chain expressing CD8&#43; and CD4&#43; T cells with varying differentiation states in response to Listeria monocytogenes, tumors, and respiratory influenza infection. Expanded V{beta} chain expressing T cells could be directly linked to the recognition of specific antigens from Listeria, tumor cells, or influenza. In the setting of influenza infection, we showed that the common therapeutic approaches of intramuscular vaccination or convalescent serum transfer altered the clonal diversity and differentiation state of responding T cells. Thus, we present a new method to monitor broad changes in TCR specificity paired with T cell differentiation during adaptive immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExposure to fungi, especially Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.), can elicit potent allergic inflammation that triggers and worsens asthmatic disease. Dendritic cells (DCs), initiate allergic inflammatory responses to allergic stimuli. However, it is unclear if A.f. spores during isotropic growth (early spore swelling) can activate DCs to initiate allergic responses or if germination is required. This lack of basic understanding of how A.f. causes disease is a barrier to the development of new treatments.

ObjectiveTo show that a precise A.f. morphotype stage during spore swelling can trigger DCs to mediate allergic inflammatory responses and ascertain if antifungal therapeutics can be effective at suppressing this process.

MethodsWe employed an A.f. strain deficient in pyrimidine biosynthesis ({Delta}pyrG) to generate populations of A.f. spores arrested at different stages of isotropic growth (swelling) via temporal removal of uracil and uridine from growth media. These arrested spore stages were cultured with bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs), and their activation measured via flow cytometry and ELISA to interrogate which growth stage was able to activate BMDCs. These BMDCs were then adoptively transferred into the airways, to assess if they were able to mediate allergic inflammation in naive recipient mice. Allergic airway inflammation in vivo was determined via flow cytometry, ELISA and qPCR. This system was also used to determine if antifungal drug (itraconazole) treatment could alter early stages of spore swelling and therefore BMDC activation and in vivo allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer.

ResultsWe found that A.f. isotropic growth is essential to trigger BMDC activation and mediate allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, using time arrested A.f. stages, we found that least 3h in growth media enabled spores to swell sufficiently to activate BMDCs to elicit allergic airway inflammation in vivo. Incubation of germinating A.f. with itraconazole reduced spore swelling and partially reduced their ability to activate BMDCs to elicit in vivo allergic airway inflammation.

ConclusionIn summary, our results have pinpointed the precise stage of A.f. development when germinating spores are able to activate DCs to mediate downstream allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we have identified that antifungal therapeutics can be effective in reducing the potential of A.f. spores to stimulate allergic responses, highlighting a potential mechanism by which antifungal treatment might help to prevent the development of fungal allergy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immune system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8&#43; T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8&#43; T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Co-signaling molecules modulate T cell function and are essential to control the duration and amplitude of immune responses. These molecules belong to the immunoglobulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamilies and have been extensively studied; however, the immunomodulatory role of several family members remains unknown. We show that CD271 (also known as p75 or NGFR), a TNFR superfamily member, is highly expressed on peritoneal B1 B cells, but not on conventional (B2) B cells at steady state. CD271 expression by B cells specifically restrains the response to T cell-independent type 2 antigens (TI-2). B1 cell-expressed CD271 maintains peritoneal CD4&#43; T cell quiescence, and augmented antibody responses to TI-2 antigens in CD271-deficient mice are dependent on CD4&#43; T cells. This increase in antibody production correlates with improved bacterial neutralization in vitro and survival after bacterial challenge in vivo. Further, our results suggest that CD271 can directly inhibit mouse and human T cell activity to the same extent as PD-L1, a known, negative regulator of T cell function. These results establish CD271 as a co-inhibitory molecule that could be targeted to improve the efficacy of vaccines against pathogenic encapsulated bacteria and to broadly modulate the T cell response in therapeutic contexts.

eTOC summaryLebel et al. identify an unexpected role for CD271, a neurotrophin receptor, in directly inhibiting T cell function. B1 cell-expressed CD271 maintains CD4&#43; T cell quiescence; in the absence of CD271, T cells bolster antibody production to T-independent antigens, enhancing the response to encapsulated bacteria.</p>
