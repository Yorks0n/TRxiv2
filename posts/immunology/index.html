A.; Valdez, R.; Gherasim, C.; Gordon, A.; Liu, L.; Ho, D. D.\nScore: 1300.7, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568730\nCOVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.\nHumoral immune responses to the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA booster\nAuthors: Marking, U.; Bladh, O.; Aguilera, K.; Yang, Y.; Greilert-Norin, N.; Blom, K.; Hober, S.; Klingstrom, J.; Havervall, S.; Aberg, M.; Sheward, D. J.; Thalin, C.\nScore: 68.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572575\nContinued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly. Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were. Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.\nComparison of mitochondrial response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in human lung microvascular, coronary artery endothelial and bronchial epithelial cells\nAuthors: Kulkoviene, G.; Narauskaite, D.; Tunaityte, A.; Volkeviciute, A.; Balion, Z.; Kutakh, O.; Gecys, D.; Kairyte, M.; Uldukyte, M.; Stankevicius, E.; Jekabsone, A.\nScore: 33.9, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572363\nRecent evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects mitochondria with a cell type-dependent outcome. We elucidate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) on the mitochondrial network and cristae morphology, oxygen consumption, mitoROS production, and inflammatory cytokine expression in cultured human lung microvascular (HLMVEC) and coronary artery endothelial (HCAEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). Live Mito Orange staining, STED microscopy and Fiji MiNa analysis were used for mitochondrial cristae and network morphometry, Agilent XFp analyser for mitochondrial/glycolytic activity, MitoSOX fluorescence for mitochondrial ROS, and qRT-PCR plus Luminex for cytokines. In HLMVEC, SARS-CoV-2 RBD fragmented the mitochondrial network, decreased cristae density, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis and induced mitoROS-mediated GM-CSF and IL-1{beta} expression in all three investigated cell types and IL-8 - in both endothelial cell types. Mitochondrial ROS control SARS-CoV-2 RBD-induced inflammation in HLMVEC, HCAEC and HBEC, with the mitochondria of HLMVEC being more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 RBD.\nPersistent immune imprinting after XBB.1.5 COVID vaccination in humans\nAuthors: Tortorici, M. A.; Addetia, A.; Seo, A. J.; Brown, J.; Sprouse, K.; Logue, J.; Clarke, E.; Franko, N.; Chu, H.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 267.7, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569129\nImmune imprinting - also known as original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.\nCRISPRi screens identify the lncRNA, LOUP, as a multifunctional locus regulating macrophage differentiation epigenetically and inflammatory signaling through a short, encoded peptide\nAuthors: Halasz, H.; Malekos, E.; Covarrubias, S.; Yitiz, S.; Montano, C.; Sudek, L.; Katzman, S.; Liu, S. J.; Horlbeck, M. A.; Weissman, J. S.; Carpenter, S.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572453\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) account for the largest portion of RNA from the transcriptome, yet most of their functions remain unknown. Here we performed two independent high-throughput CRISPRi screens to understand the role of lncRNAs in monocyte function and differentiation. The first was a reporter-based screen to identify lncRNAs that regulate TLR4-NFkB signaling in human monocytes and the second screen identified lncRNAs involved in monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We successfully identified numerous novel non-coding and protein-coding genes that can positively or negatively regulate inflammation and differentiation. To understand the functional roles of lncRNAs in both processes, we chose to further study the lncRNA LOUP (lncRNA originating from upstream regulatory element of SPI1 [also known as PU.1]), as it emerged as a top hit in both screens. Not only does LOUP regulate its neighboring gene, the myeloid fate determining factor SPI1, thereby affecting monocyte to macrophage differentiation, but knockdown of LOUP leads to a broad upregulation of NFkB-targeted genes at baseline and upon TLR4-NFkB activation. LOUP also harbors three small open reading frames (sORFs) capable of being translated and are responsible for LOUPs ability to negatively regulate TLR4/NFkB signaling. This work emphasizes the value of high-throughput screening to rapidly identify functional lncRNAs in the innate immune system.\nMurine Alveolar Macrophages Rapidly Accumulate Intranasally Administered SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein leading to Neutrophil Recruitment and Damage\nAuthors: Park, C.; Hwang, I.-Y.; Yan, S. L.-S.; Vimonpatranon, S.; Wei, D.; Van Ryk, D.; Girard, A.; Cicala, C.; Arthos, J.; Kehrl, J. H.\nScore: 23.5, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.532446\nThe trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral attachment facilitating cell entry. Most COVID-19 vaccines direct mammalian cells to express the Spike protein or deliver it directly via inoculation to engender a protective immune response. The trafficking and cellular tropism of the Spike protein in vivo and its impact on immune cells remains incompletely elucidated. In this study we inoculated mice intranasally, intravenously, and subcutaneously with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Using flow cytometry and imaging techniques we analyzed its localization, immune cell tropism, and acute functional impact. Intranasal administration led to rapid lung alveolar macrophage uptake, pulmonary vascular leakage, and neutrophil recruitment and damage. When injected near the inguinal lymph node medullary, but not subcapsular macrophages, captured the protein, while scrotal injection recruited and fragmented neutrophils. Wide-spread endothelial and liver Kupffer cell uptake followed intravenous administration. Human peripheral blood cells B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells all efficiently bound Spike protein. Exposure to the Spike protein enhanced neutrophil NETosis and augmented human macrophage TNF- and IL-6 production. Human and murine immune cells employed C-type lectin receptors and Siglecs to help capture the Spike protein. This study highlights the potential toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for mammalian cells and illustrates the central role for alveolar macrophage in pathogenic protein uptake.\nHiding in Plain Sight: Thymic CD8+FOXP3+Tregs sequester CD25 and are enriched in human tissues\nAuthors: Jarvis, L. B.; Howlett, S. K.; Coppard, V. B.; Rainbow, D. B.; Alkwai, S. B.; Ellis, L. B.; Georgieva, Z. B.; Suchanek, O. B.; Mousa, H. S.; Mahbubani, K. T.; Saeb-Parsy, K. B.; Wicker, L. S.; Jones, J. L.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573232\nFor decades regulatory T cell (Treg) research has focussed on CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs, whilst characterisation of CD8+FOXP3+ Tregs has been limited by their paucity in blood. Here, by studying 98 tissues from 27 deceased transplant organ donors we demonstrate that despite representing less than 5% of circulating Tregs, fully functional, thymically derived CD8+FOXP3+ Tregs are highly enriched in human tissues particularly in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, where they reside as CD25lo/-CD8+CD69+CD103+TLR9+HELIOS+FOXP3+ Tregs. Despite lacking surface CD25 expression, CD8+ Tregs in tissue are demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR and express CD25 intracellularly. Surface CD25 expression is quickly regained in vitro, allowing cell sorting for therapeutic expansion and confirmation of their suppressive function. We suggest that these elusive cells likely play an essential but previously unappreciated role in maintaining peripheral tolerance within human tissues.\nA ketogenic diet reduces age-induced chronic neuroinflammation in mice\nAuthors: Nomura, M.; Murad, N. F.; Madhavan, S. S.; Eap, B.; Garcia, T. Y.; Aguirre, C. G.; Verdin, E.; Ellerby, L.; Furman, D.; Newman, J. C.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569598\nBeta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body synthesized during fasting or strenuous exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet (KD), which induces BHB levels similar to fasting every other week, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. BHB actively regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. Neither of these activities has been well-characterized in the brain and they may represent mechanisms by which BHB affects brain function during aging. First, we analyzed hepatic gene expression in an aging KD-treated mouse cohort using bulk RNA-seq. In addition to the downregulation of TOR pathway activity, cyclic KD reduces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. We observed via flow cytometry that KD also modulates age-related systemic T cell functions. Next, we investigated whether BHB affects brain cells transcriptionally in vitro. Gene expression analysis in primary human brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, neurons) using RNA-seq shows that BHB causes a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation in microglia. Furthermore, we confirmed that BHB similarly reduces LPS-induced inflammation in primary mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BHB is recognized as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, and an agonist of the GPCR Hcar2. Nevertheless, in microglia, BHBs anti-inflammatory effects are independent of these known mechanisms. Finally, we examined the brain gene expression of 12-month-old male mice fed with one-week and one-year cyclic KD. While a one-week KD increases inflammatory signaling, a one-year cyclic KD reduces neuroinflammation induced by aging. In summary, our findings demon-strate that BHB mitigates the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, like LPS, possibly leading to decreased chronic inflammation in the brain after long-term KD treatment in aging mice.\nOverlapping and Distinct Mechanisms of Effective Neoantigen Cancer Vaccines and Immune Checkpoint Therapy\nAuthors: Keshari, S.; Shavkunov, A. S.; Miao, Q.; Saha, A.; Williams, C. D.; Highsmith, A. M.; Pineda, J. E.; Alspach, E.; Hu, K.; Pauken, K. E.; Chen, K.; Gubin, M. M.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.570816\nThe goal of therapeutic cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is to eliminate cancer by expanding and/or sustaining intratumoral T cells with enhanced anti-tumor capabilities. However, whether therapeutic cancer vaccination and ICT achieve enhanced anti-tumor immunity by distinct or somewhat overlapping immunological mechanisms remains unclear. Considering increasing interest in combining these two types of treatment to improve efficacy rates, a better understanding of how these treatments are similar and different is needed. Here, we compared effective therapeutic tumor-specific mutant neoantigen (NeoAg) cancer vaccines with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 combination ICT in preclinical models. We found that both NeoAg vaccines and anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 ICT induced robust expansion of intratumoral NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells, though the degree of expansion and acquisition of effector activity was more substantial following NeoAg vaccine compared to ICT. Further, we found that NeoAg vaccines are particularly adept at inducing proliferating and stem-like NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells. Additionally, anti-CTLA-4 notably induced ICOS+ Th1-like CD4 T cells expressing the transcription factor Bhlhe40 and, interestingly, when combined with anti-PD-1 a small subset of Th2-like CD4 T cells was observed. Conversely, we observed a more divergent effect on certain subsets of intratumoral macrophages induced by NeoAg vaccines as compared to ICT. Although effective NeoAg vaccines or ICT expanded M1-like iNOS+ macrophages, NeoAg vaccines expanded rather than suppressed (as observed with ICT) distinct subpopulations of M2-like CX3CR1+ CD206+ macrophages, associated with the poly I:C adjuvant used in the vaccine. Considering the similarities and difference we identified in how NeoAg vaccines versus ICT reshaped the TME, we hypothesized that combining ICT with NeoAg vaccines would expand the therapeutic window for efficacy in these preclinical models. Indeed, we found the combination NeoAg vaccine plus ICT induced superior anti-tumor control compared to either therapy in isolation, highlighting the utility of combining these modalities to eliminate cancer. HighlightsO_LINeoantigen vaccines utilize distinct cellular mechanisms from anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy. C_LIO_LINeoantigen vaccines preferentially induce PD-1+ TCF1+ stem-like and proliferating neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells C_LIO_LIAnti-PD-1 expands PD-1+ TCF-7-NeoAg-specific Teff/Tex, with combination anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 ICT inducing robust expansion of Bhlhe40hi PD-1+ TCF-7-NeoAg-specific Teff/Tex.

K.; Bilay, M.; Ziska, E.; Taylor, M. J.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572799\nThe controlled oligomerization of signaling proteins is an essential feature of many inflammatory signaling pathways. An example is IL-1 receptor signaling, which relies on the oligomerization of the Death Domain (DD)-containing proteins MyD88 and IRAK family kinases. This process leads to the assembly of the Myddosome signaling complex, and disrupting assembly holds potential for anti-inflammatory treatments. However, IRAKs signaling activity is also regulated by auto-/trans-phosphorylation, and it is unclear if these processes operate at or downstream of Myddosome assembly. Here, we find that the initial stage of Myddosome assembly is solely controlled by MyD88:IRAK4 DD interactions. In later stages, IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation serves as a switch, regulating IRAK1/2/3 incorporation and DD oligomerization. Small molecule inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase activity block this later stage of assembly, explaining how they dampen inflammatory signaling. Our data reveals IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation as an energy-dependent switch activating the heterotypic assembly of IRAKs DDs and downstream inflammatory IL-1 signaling. This highlights how a signaling cascade integrates phosphorylation and protein oligomerization steps.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly.

Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were.

Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects mitochondria with a cell type-dependent outcome. We elucidate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) on the mitochondrial network and cristae morphology, oxygen consumption, mitoROS production, and inflammatory cytokine expression in cultured human lung microvascular (HLMVEC) and coronary artery endothelial (HCAEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). Live Mito Orange staining, STED microscopy and Fiji MiNa analysis were used for mitochondrial cristae and network morphometry, Agilent XFp analyser for mitochondrial/glycolytic activity, MitoSOX fluorescence for mitochondrial ROS, and qRT-PCR plus Luminex for cytokines. In HLMVEC, SARS-CoV-2 RBD fragmented the mitochondrial network, decreased cristae density, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis and induced mitoROS-mediated GM-CSF and IL-1{beta} expression in all three investigated cell types and IL-8 - in both endothelial cell types. Mitochondrial ROS control SARS-CoV-2 RBD-induced inflammation in HLMVEC, HCAEC and HBEC, with the mitochondria of HLMVEC being more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 RBD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune imprinting - also known as  original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) account for the largest portion of RNA from the transcriptome, yet most of their functions remain unknown. Here we performed two independent high-throughput CRISPRi screens to understand the role of lncRNAs in monocyte function and differentiation. The first was a reporter-based screen to identify lncRNAs that regulate TLR4-NFkB signaling in human monocytes and the second screen identified lncRNAs involved in monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We successfully identified numerous novel non-coding and protein-coding genes that can positively or negatively regulate inflammation and differentiation. To understand the functional roles of lncRNAs in both processes, we chose to further study the lncRNA LOUP (lncRNA originating from upstream regulatory element of SPI1 [also known as PU.1]), as it emerged as a top hit in both screens. Not only does LOUP regulate its neighboring gene, the myeloid fate determining factor SPI1, thereby affecting monocyte to macrophage differentiation, but knockdown of LOUP leads to a broad upregulation of NFkB-targeted genes at baseline and upon TLR4-NFkB activation. LOUP also harbors three small open reading frames (sORFs) capable of being translated and are responsible for LOUPs ability to negatively regulate TLR4/NFkB signaling. This work emphasizes the value of high-throughput screening to rapidly identify functional lncRNAs in the innate immune system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral attachment facilitating cell entry. Most COVID-19 vaccines direct mammalian cells to express the Spike protein or deliver it directly via inoculation to engender a protective immune response. The trafficking and cellular tropism of the Spike protein in vivo and its impact on immune cells remains incompletely elucidated. In this study we inoculated mice intranasally, intravenously, and subcutaneously with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Using flow cytometry and imaging techniques we analyzed its localization, immune cell tropism, and acute functional impact. Intranasal administration led to rapid lung alveolar macrophage uptake, pulmonary vascular leakage, and neutrophil recruitment and damage. When injected near the inguinal lymph node medullary, but not subcapsular macrophages, captured the protein, while scrotal injection recruited and fragmented neutrophils. Wide-spread endothelial and liver Kupffer cell uptake followed intravenous administration. Human peripheral blood cells B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells all efficiently bound Spike protein. Exposure to the Spike protein enhanced neutrophil NETosis and augmented human macrophage TNF- and IL-6 production. Human and murine immune cells employed C-type lectin receptors and Siglecs to help capture the Spike protein. This study highlights the potential toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for mammalian cells and illustrates the central role for alveolar macrophage in pathogenic protein uptake.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For decades regulatory T cell (Treg) research has focussed on CD4&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs, whilst characterisation of CD8&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs has been limited by their paucity in blood. Here, by studying 98 tissues from 27 deceased transplant organ donors we demonstrate that despite representing less than 5% of circulating Tregs, fully functional, thymically derived CD8&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs are highly enriched in human tissues particularly in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, where they reside as CD25lo/-CD8&#43;CD69&#43;CD103&#43;TLR9&#43;HELIOS&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs. Despite lacking surface CD25 expression, CD8&#43; Tregs in tissue are demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR and express CD25 intracellularly. Surface CD25 expression is quickly regained in vitro, allowing cell sorting for therapeutic expansion and confirmation of their suppressive function. We suggest that these elusive cells likely play an essential but previously unappreciated role in maintaining peripheral tolerance within human tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body synthesized during fasting or strenuous exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet (KD), which induces BHB levels similar to fasting every other week, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. BHB actively regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. Neither of these activities has been well-characterized in the brain and they may represent mechanisms by which BHB affects brain function during aging. First, we analyzed hepatic gene expression in an aging KD-treated mouse cohort using bulk RNA-seq. In addition to the downregulation of TOR pathway activity, cyclic KD reduces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. We observed via flow cytometry that KD also modulates age-related systemic T cell functions. Next, we investigated whether BHB affects brain cells transcriptionally in vitro. Gene expression analysis in primary human brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, neurons) using RNA-seq shows that BHB causes a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation in microglia. Furthermore, we confirmed that BHB similarly reduces LPS-induced inflammation in primary mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BHB is recognized as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, and an agonist of the GPCR Hcar2. Nevertheless, in microglia, BHBs anti-inflammatory effects are independent of these known mechanisms. Finally, we examined the brain gene expression of 12-month-old male mice fed with one-week and one-year cyclic KD. While a one-week KD increases inflammatory signaling, a one-year cyclic KD reduces neuroinflammation induced by aging. In summary, our findings demon-strate that BHB mitigates the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, like LPS, possibly leading to decreased chronic inflammation in the brain after long-term KD treatment in aging mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The goal of therapeutic cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is to eliminate cancer by expanding and/or sustaining intratumoral T cells with enhanced anti-tumor capabilities. However, whether therapeutic cancer vaccination and ICT achieve enhanced anti-tumor immunity by distinct or somewhat overlapping immunological mechanisms remains unclear. Considering increasing interest in combining these two types of treatment to improve efficacy rates, a better understanding of how these treatments are similar and different is needed. Here, we compared effective therapeutic tumor-specific mutant neoantigen (NeoAg) cancer vaccines with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 combination ICT in preclinical models. We found that both NeoAg vaccines and anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 ICT induced robust expansion of intratumoral NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells, though the degree of expansion and acquisition of effector activity was more substantial following NeoAg vaccine compared to ICT. Further, we found that NeoAg vaccines are particularly adept at inducing proliferating and stem-like NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells. Additionally, anti-CTLA-4 notably induced ICOS&#43; Th1-like CD4 T cells expressing the transcription factor Bhlhe40 and, interestingly, when combined with anti-PD-1 a small subset of Th2-like CD4 T cells was observed. Conversely, we observed a more divergent effect on certain subsets of intratumoral macrophages induced by NeoAg vaccines as compared to ICT. Although effective NeoAg vaccines or ICT expanded M1-like iNOS&#43; macrophages, NeoAg vaccines expanded rather than suppressed (as observed with ICT) distinct subpopulations of M2-like CX3CR1&#43; CD206&#43; macrophages, associated with the poly I:C adjuvant used in the vaccine. Considering the similarities and difference we identified in how NeoAg vaccines versus ICT reshaped the TME, we hypothesized that combining ICT with NeoAg vaccines would expand the therapeutic window for efficacy in these preclinical models. Indeed, we found the combination NeoAg vaccine plus ICT induced superior anti-tumor control compared to either therapy in isolation, highlighting the utility of combining these modalities to eliminate cancer.

C_LIO_LIAnti-CTLA-4 promotes Th1-like ICOS&#43; Bhlhe40&#43; CD4 T cells, while combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 ICT induces a small subset of Th2-like CD4 T cells

        <p class="abstract">The controlled oligomerization of signaling proteins is an essential feature of many inflammatory signaling pathways. An example is IL-1 receptor signaling, which relies on the oligomerization of the Death Domain (DD)-containing proteins MyD88 and IRAK family kinases. This process leads to the assembly of the Myddosome signaling complex, and disrupting assembly holds potential for anti-inflammatory treatments. However, IRAKs signaling activity is also regulated by auto-/trans-phosphorylation, and it is unclear if these processes operate at or downstream of Myddosome assembly. Here, we find that the initial stage of Myddosome assembly is solely controlled by MyD88:IRAK4 DD interactions. In later stages, IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation serves as a switch, regulating IRAK1/2/3 incorporation and DD oligomerization. Small molecule inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase activity block this later stage of assembly, explaining how they dampen inflammatory signaling. Our data reveals IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation as an energy-dependent switch activating the heterotypic assembly of IRAKs DDs and downstream inflammatory IL-1 signaling. This highlights how a signaling cascade integrates phosphorylation and protein oligomerization steps.</p>
