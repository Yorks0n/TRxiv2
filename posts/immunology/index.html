D.\nScore: 38.0, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.545921\nRespiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can activate an exaggerated inflammatory response (cytokine storm) in the lungs that may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hospitalization, and death. Therapies that target a specific pathogen (i.e. anti-virals) must, by nature, be selected after a specific diagnosis and may become ineffective due to pathogen evolution. An alternate strategy is to counter the exaggerated innate immune response present in ARDS patients using host-directed drug therapies that are agnostic to the infectious agent to overcome both of these challenges. Originally described as the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is now understood to be an important mediator of inflammation caused by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Here we show that paridiprubart, a monoclonal antibody that prevents TLR4 dimer formation, inhibits the response to TLR4 agonists including LPS, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the DAMP high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the NF-{kappa}B response to infection by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Notable in this regard, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 increases HMGB1 levels, and that paridiprubart inhibits both the SARS-CoV-2 and HMGB1-triggered NF-{kappa}B response, illustrating its potential to suppress this self-amplifying inflammatory signal. We also observed that the inhibitory effect of paridiprubart is apparent when cells are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is itself a direct TLR4 agonist. In the context of active infection, paridiprubart suppressed the NF-{kappa}B-dependent response elicited by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the seasonal coronavirus 229E, influenza A virus or Haemophilus influenzae, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen. Combined, these findings reinforce the central role played by TLR4 in the inflammatory response to infection by diverse pathogens, and demonstrates the protective potential of paridiprubart-dependent inhibition of pathogenic TLR4 responses.\nAntigenic cartography using variant-specific hamster sera reveals substantial antigenic variation among Omicron subvariants\nAuthors: Mühlemann, B.; Trimpert, J.; Walper, F.; Schmidt, M. L.; Schroeder, S.; Jeworowski, L. M.; Beheim-Schwarzbach, J.; Bleicker, T.; Niemeyer, D.; Adler, J. M.; Vidal, R. M.; Langner, C.; Vladimirova, D.; Smith, D. J.; Voss, M.; Paltzow, L.; Martinez Christophersen, C.; Rose, R.; Krumbholz, A.; Jones, T. C.; Corman, V. M.; Drosten, C.\nScore: 20.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547076\nSARS-CoV-2 has developed substantial antigenic variability. As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1+E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.\nSingle-cell analysis of signalling and transcriptional responses to type I interferons\nAuthors: Rigby, R. E.; Rue-Albrecht, K.; Sims, D.; Rehwinkel, J.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547491\nType I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We find cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varies between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.\nTime-, tissue- and treatment-associated heterogeneity in tumour-residing migratory DCs\nAuthors: Lee, C.

A.; Dovedi, S.; Roychoudhuri, R.; Withers, D. R.; Clatworthy, M. R.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547454\nCCR7-expressing mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mRegDCs), such as PD-L1, have been identified in tumours and draining lymph nodes (dLN), but their spatiotemporal dynamics and role in anti-tumour immune responses remain unclear. Using photoconvertible mice to precisely track DC migration, we found that mRegDCs comprised the dominant DC population arriving in the dLN, but a subset remained tumour-resident despite CCR7 expression. These tumour-retained mRegDCs were phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from their dLN counterparts and were heterogeneous, with increasing features of an 'exhausted' transcriptional profile with more prolonged tumour residence. This was characterised by reduced expression of antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory transcripts, and these 'exhaustion' features were attenuated by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Tumour mRegDCs spatially co-localised with effector CD8+ T cells in human solid tumours, and anti-PD-L1 treatment enhanced their expression of several T cell-stimulatory molecules. Altogether, these data provide fundamental insights into mRegDC biology and their role in cancer immunotherapy.\nVibrio cholerae Arrests Intestinal Epithelial Proliferation through T6SS-dependent Activation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Pathway.\nAuthors: Xu, X.; Foley, E.\nScore: 12.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547108\nTo maintain an effective barrier, intestinal epithelial progenitor cells must divide at a rate that matches the loss of dead and dying cells. Otherwise, epithelial breaches expose the host to systemic infection by gut-resident microbes. Unlike most pathogens, Vibrio cholerae blocks tissue repair by arresting progenitor proliferation in the Drosophila infection model. At present, we do not understand how Vibrio circumvents such a critical antibacterial defense. In a series of genetic experiments, we found that V. cholerae blocks epithelial repair by activating the growth inhibitor Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway in progenitors. Specifically, we discovered that interactions between Vibrio and gut commensals initiate BMP signaling via host innate immune defenses. Notably, we found that Vibrio also activates BMP and arrests proliferation in zebrafish intestines, indicating an evolutionarily conserved link between infection, BMP and failure in tissue repair. Combined, our study highlights how enteric pathogens engage host immune and growth regulatory pathways to disrupt intestinal epithelial repair.\nInterferons are the key cytokines acting on pancreatic islets in type 1 diabetes\nAuthors: Coomans de Brachene, A.; Alvelos, M. I.; Szymczak, F.; Zimath, P. L.; Castela, A.; Marmontel de Souza, B.; Roca Rivada, A.; Marin-Canas, S.; Yi, X.; Op de Beeck, A.; Morgan, N. G.; Sonntag, S.; Jawurek, S.; Title, A. C.; Yesildag, B.; Pattou, F.; Kerr-Conte, J.; Montanya, E.; Nacher, M.; Marselli, L.; Marchetti, P.; Richardson, S. J.; Eizirik, D. L.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547000\nThe pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to danger signals such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.\nMacrophages sense ECM mechanics and growth factor availability through cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate their tissue repair program\nAuthors: Meizlish, M. L.; Kimura, Y.; Pope, S. D.; Matta, R.; Kim, C.; Philip, N.; Meyaard, L.; Gonzalez, A.; Medzhitov, R.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.545586\nTissue resident macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair. How macrophages monitor and maintain tissue integrity is not well understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key structural and organizational component of tissues. Here, we find that macrophages sense the mechanical properties of the ECM in order to regulate a specific tissue repair program. We show that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskeletal remodeling and can be performed in three-dimensional environments through a non-canonical, integrin-independent mechanism analogous to amoeboid migration. We find that these cytoskeletal dynamics also integrate biochemical signaling by CSF1, ultimately regulating chromatin accessibility to control the mechanosensitive gene expression program. This study suggests a distinct mode of ECM mechanosensing and growth factor signaling through which macrophages may regulate tissue repair and fibrosis.\nInfection-induced vascular inflammation in COVID-19 links focal microglial dysfunction with neuropathologies through IL-1/IL-6-related systemic inflammatory states\nAuthors: Fekete, R.; Simats, A.; Biro, E.; Cserep, C.; Schwarcz, A. D.; Posfai, B.; Szabadits, E.; Kornyei, Z.; Toth, K.; Kellermayer, A.; David, C.; Acsady, L.; Kontra, L.; Silvestre-Roig, C.; Moldvay, J.; Fillinger, J.; Hortobagyi, T.; Liesz, A.; Benko, S.; Denes, A.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546214\nCOVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.\nScalable in-vitro immunostimulation of human blood for in-depth profiling of acute immune response effects\nAuthors: Reitzner, S. M.; Mikes, J.; Brodin, P.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-06-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544193\nIn-vitro immune stimulation of whole blood has great analytic potential for exploring the immune system function. However, logistical and biological constraints might limit the extent to which such investigations can be performed. Flexible and often even low-tech mobile applicability can increase the diversity of conditions that can be investigated. To this end, we developed and optimized a medium that enables prolonged in-vitro stimulation and enables highly functional immune responses within 24 hours of incubation. In addition, we also developed and optimized a low-tech water-based mobile incubator to enable logistical flexibility. Finally, we describe the implementation of both systems using a practical example of sample collection at a sampling site with no access to laboratory equipment outside of a research lab.\nEngagement of sialylated glycans with Siglec receptors on myeloid suppressor cells inhibit anti-cancer immunity via CCL2\nAuthors: Wieboldt, R.; Carlini, E.; Chia-wei, L.; Boersch, A.; Zingg, A.; Lardinois, D.; Herzig, P.; Don, L.; Zippelius, A.; Laeubli, H.; Rodrigues Mantuano, N.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547025\nOverexpression of sialic acids on glycans, called hypersialylation is a common alteration found in cancer. Hypersialylation can, for example, enhance immune evasion via interaction with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we tested the role of sialic acid on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their interaction with Siglec receptors. We found that MDSCs derived from the blood of lung cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice strongly express inhibitory Siglec receptors. In murine cancer models of emergency myelopoiesis, Siglec-E knockout on myeloid cells resulted in prolonged survival and increased infiltration of activated T cells. Targeting suppressive myeloid cells by blocking Siglec receptors or desialylation led to strong reduction of their suppressive potential. We further identified CCL2 as mediator involved in T cell suppression upon interaction of sialoglycans and Siglec receptors on MDSCs. Our results provide mechanistic insights how sialylated glycans inhibit anti-cancer immunity by facilitating CCL2 expression.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can activate an exaggerated inflammatory response (cytokine storm) in the lungs that may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hospitalization, and death. Therapies that target a specific pathogen (i.e. anti-virals) must, by nature, be selected after a specific diagnosis and may become ineffective due to pathogen evolution. An alternate strategy is to counter the exaggerated innate immune response present in ARDS patients using host-directed drug therapies that are agnostic to the infectious agent to overcome both of these challenges. Originally described as the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is now understood to be an important mediator of inflammation caused by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Here we show that paridiprubart, a monoclonal antibody that prevents TLR4 dimer formation, inhibits the response to TLR4 agonists including LPS, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the DAMP high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the NF-{kappa}B response to infection by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Notable in this regard, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 increases HMGB1 levels, and that paridiprubart inhibits both the SARS-CoV-2 and HMGB1-triggered NF-{kappa}B response, illustrating its potential to suppress this self-amplifying inflammatory signal. We also observed that the inhibitory effect of paridiprubart is apparent when cells are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is itself a direct TLR4 agonist. In the context of active infection, paridiprubart suppressed the NF-{kappa}B-dependent response elicited by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the seasonal coronavirus 229E, influenza A virus or Haemophilus influenzae, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen. Combined, these findings reinforce the central role played by TLR4 in the inflammatory response to infection by diverse pathogens, and demonstrates the protective potential of paridiprubart-dependent inhibition of pathogenic TLR4 responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has developed substantial antigenic variability. As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1&#43;E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We find cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varies between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CCR7-expressing mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mRegDCs), such as PD-L1, have been identified in tumours and draining lymph nodes (dLN), but their spatiotemporal dynamics and role in anti-tumour immune responses remain unclear. Using photoconvertible mice to precisely track DC migration, we found that mRegDCs comprised the dominant DC population arriving in the dLN, but a subset remained tumour-resident despite CCR7 expression. These tumour-retained mRegDCs were phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from their dLN counterparts and were heterogeneous, with increasing features of an &#39;exhausted&#39; transcriptional profile with more prolonged tumour residence. This was characterised by reduced expression of antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory transcripts, and these &#39;exhaustion&#39; features were attenuated by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Tumour mRegDCs spatially co-localised with effector CD8&#43; T cells in human solid tumours, and anti-PD-L1 treatment enhanced their expression of several T cell-stimulatory molecules. Altogether, these data provide fundamental insights into mRegDC biology and their role in cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To maintain an effective barrier, intestinal epithelial progenitor cells must divide at a rate that matches the loss of dead and dying cells. Otherwise, epithelial breaches expose the host to systemic infection by gut-resident microbes. Unlike most pathogens, Vibrio cholerae blocks tissue repair by arresting progenitor proliferation in the Drosophila infection model. At present, we do not understand how Vibrio circumvents such a critical antibacterial defense. In a series of genetic experiments, we found that V. cholerae blocks epithelial repair by activating the growth inhibitor Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway in progenitors. Specifically, we discovered that interactions between Vibrio and gut commensals initiate BMP signaling via host innate immune defenses. Notably, we found that Vibrio also activates BMP and arrests proliferation in zebrafish intestines, indicating an evolutionarily conserved link between infection, BMP and failure in tissue repair. Combined, our study highlights how enteric pathogens engage host immune and growth regulatory pathways to disrupt intestinal epithelial repair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to danger signals such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue resident macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair. How macrophages monitor and maintain tissue integrity is not well understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key structural and organizational component of tissues. Here, we find that macrophages sense the mechanical properties of the ECM in order to regulate a specific tissue repair program. We show that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskeletal remodeling and can be performed in three-dimensional environments through a non-canonical, integrin-independent mechanism analogous to amoeboid migration. We find that these cytoskeletal dynamics also integrate biochemical signaling by CSF1, ultimately regulating chromatin accessibility to control the mechanosensitive gene expression program. This study suggests a distinct mode of ECM mechanosensing and growth factor signaling through which macrophages may regulate tissue repair and fibrosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In-vitro immune stimulation of whole blood has great analytic potential for exploring the immune system function. However, logistical and biological constraints might limit the extent to which such investigations can be performed. Flexible and often even low-tech mobile applicability can increase the diversity of conditions that can be investigated. To this end, we developed and optimized a medium that enables prolonged in-vitro stimulation and enables highly functional immune responses within 24 hours of incubation. In addition, we also developed and optimized a low-tech water-based mobile incubator to enable logistical flexibility. Finally, we describe the implementation of both systems using a practical example of sample collection at a sampling site with no access to laboratory equipment outside of a research lab.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overexpression of sialic acids on glycans, called hypersialylation is a common alteration found in cancer. Hypersialylation can, for example, enhance immune evasion via interaction with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we tested the role of sialic acid on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their interaction with Siglec receptors. We found that MDSCs derived from the blood of lung cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice strongly express inhibitory Siglec receptors. In murine cancer models of emergency myelopoiesis, Siglec-E knockout on myeloid cells resulted in prolonged survival and increased infiltration of activated T cells. Targeting suppressive myeloid cells by blocking Siglec receptors or desialylation led to strong reduction of their suppressive potential. We further identified CCL2 as mediator involved in T cell suppression upon interaction of sialoglycans and Siglec receptors on MDSCs. Our results provide mechanistic insights how sialylated glycans inhibit anti-cancer immunity by facilitating CCL2 expression.</p>
