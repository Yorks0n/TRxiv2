Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.\nRepeated Omicron exposures override ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting\nAuthors: Yisimayi, A.; Song, W.; Wang, J.; Jian, F.; Yu, Y.; Chen, X.; Xu, Y.; Yang, S.; Niu, X.; Xiao, T.; Wang, J.; Zhao, L.; Sun, H.; An, R.; Zhang, N.; Wang, Y.; Wang, P.; Yu, L.; Lv, Z.; Gu, Q.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Shen, Z.; Wang, Y.; Xie, X. S.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 618.7, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.01.538516\nThe continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.\nRapid establishment of a tumor-retained state curtails the contribution of conventional NK cells to anti-tumor immunity in solid cancers\nAuthors: Dean, I. W.; Lee, C. Y.; Tuong, Z. K.; Li, Z.; Tibbitt, C. A.; Willis, C.; Gaspal, F.; Kennedy, B. C.; Matei-Rascu, V.; Fiancette, R.; Nordenvall, C.; Lindforss, U.; Baker, S. M.; Stockmann, C.; Sexl, V.; Carlesso, G.; Hammond, S. A.; Dovedi, S.; Mjosberg, J.; Hepworth, M. R.; Clatworthy, M. R.; Withers, D. R.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552797\nImmune cell dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment undermines the control of cancer progression. NK cells play critical roles in limiting early tumor growth and metastatic disease, however, established cancers contain a phenotypically distinct, tumor-specific NK cell compartment. The temporal dynamics, mechanistic underpinning and functional significance of this tumor NK pool remains incompletely understood. To address this, we exploited photo-labeling, combined with longitudinal transcriptomic and cellular analyses, to interrogate the fate of NK cells after tumor entry. In multiple murine cancer models we reveal that conventional NK cells are continuously recruited into tumors, but rapidly adopt a distinct phenotypic state with features associated with tissue-residency and complete loss of effector functions (including chemokine and cytokine production and cytotoxicity), within 48-72 hrs of entering the tumor. Depletion of NK cells from established tumors did not alter tumor growth, indicating that intratumoral NK cells cease to actively contribute to anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, comparable NK populations were identified in human colorectal cancers, confirming translational relevance and raising the possibility that interventions to reactivate NK cells within tissues may boost anti-tumor immunity in established cancers. Indeed, administration of IL-15:IL-15Ra complexes prevented the loss of NK cell function and improved tumor control, generating intratumoral NK cells with both enhanced tissue-residency characteristics and effector function. Collectively, our data reveals the fate of cNK cells after recruitment into tumors and provides insight into how intratumoral NK cell functions may be revived.\nThe tissue-resident regulatory T cell pool is shaped by transient multi-tissue migration and a conserved residency program\nAuthors: Burton, O.; Bricard, O.; Tareen, S.; Gergelits, V.; Andrews, S.; Roca, C. P.; Whyte, C.; Junius, S.; Brajic, A.; Pasciuto, E.; Ali, M.; Lemaitre, P.; Schlenner, S. M.; Ishigame, H.; Brown, B.; Dooley, J.; Liston, A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553196\nThe tissues are the site of many of the most important immunological reactions, yet the immunology of the tissues has remained relatively opaque. Recent studies have identified Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.\nDabrafenib alters MDSC differentiation and function by activation of GCN2\nAuthors: Ciudad, M. T.; Quevedo, R.; Lamorte, S.; Jin, R.; Nzirorera, N.; Koritzinsky, M.; McGaha, T. L.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552588\nThe effect of targeted therapeutics on anti-cancer immune responses is poorly understood. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib has been reported to activate the integrated stress response (ISR) kinase GCN2, and the therapeutic effect has been partially attributed to GCN2 activation. Since ISR signaling is a key component of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) development and function, we measured the effect of dabrafenib on MDSC differentiation and suppressive activity. Our data showed that dabrafenib attenuated MDSC ability to suppress T cell activity, which was associated with a GCN2-dependent block of the transition from monocytic progenitor to polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and proliferative arrest resulting in PMN-MDSC loss. Transcriptional profiling revealed that dabrafenib-driven GCN2 activation altered metabolic features in MDSCs enhancing oxidative respiration, and attenuated transcriptional programs required for PMN development. Moreover, we observed a broad downregulation of transcriptional networks associated with PMN developmental pathways, and increased activity of transcriptional regulons driven by Atf5, Mafg, and Zbtb7a. This transcriptional program alteration underlies the basis for PMN-MDSC developmental arrest, skewing immature MDSC development towards monocytic lineage cells. In vivo, we observed a pronounced reduction in PMN-MDSCs in dabrafenib-treated tumor-bearing mice suggesting that dabrafenib impacts MDSC populations systemically and locally, in the tumor immune infiltrate. Thus, our data reveals transcriptional networks that govern MDSC developmental programs, and the impact of GCN2 stress signaling on the innate immune landscape in tumors, providing novel insight into potentially beneficial off target effects of dabrafenib.\nMatching or genetic engineering of HLA Class I and II facilitates successful allogeneic 'off-the-shelf' regulatory T cell therapy\nAuthors: McCallion, O.; Du, W.; Glaser, V.; Milward, K.; Franke, C.; Kath, J.; Valkov, M.; Yang, M.; Künkele, A.; Polansky, J. K.; Schmueck-Henneresse, M.; Volk, H.-D.; Reinke, P.; Wagner, D. L.; Hester, J.; Issa, F.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.551956\nThe potential to harness regulatory T cells (Tregs) for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection has been restricted by several barriers: donor variability, manufacturing complications, and time-consuming expansion processes. These issues further complicate the use of autologous Tregs during acute disease phases or when Tregs are low in number or dysfunctional. Here we explore the potential of off-the-shelf allogeneic Tregs, from healthy donors or universal sources, to provide a more practical solution. We discover that the efficacy of these cells is undermined by the recipients immune response, and that that rigorous matching of HLA classes I and II overcomes this barrier. Importantly, genetically manipulating HLA expression enables the use of unmatched allogeneic Tregs with in vivo efficacy. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of HLA-engineered Tregs, offering a novel, ready-to-use therapeutic avenue for treating a wide array of inflammatory diseases. One-Sentence SummaryMatching or engineering of HLA-I and HLA-II facilitates allogeneic off-the-shelf regulatory T cells for immunoregulation.\nNAD+ prevents septic shock-induced death by non-canonical inflammasome blockade and IL-10 cytokine production in macrophages\nAuthors: Iske, J.; EL Fatimy, R.; Nian, Y.; Ghouzlani, A.; Eskandari, S.; Cetina Biefer, H. R.; Vasudevan, A.; Elkhal, A.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.29.013649\nSeptic shock is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response depicted in a cytokine storm that results from invasive bacterial, fungi, protozoa, and viral infections. Non-canonical inflammasome activation is crucial in the development of septic shock promoting pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production via caspase-11 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD). Here, we show that NAD+ treatment protected mice towards bacterial and LPS induced endotoxic shock by blocking the non-canonical inflammasome specifically. NAD+ administration impeded systemic IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages via the IFN-{beta}/STAT-1 signaling machinery. More importantly, NAD+ administration not only improved casp-11-/- survival but rendered WT mice completely resistant to septic shock via the IL-10 signaling pathway that was independent from the non-canonical inflammasome. Here, we delineated a two-sided effect of NAD+ blocking septic shock through a specific inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting immune homeostasis via IL-10, underscoring its unique therapeutic potential.\nA PD-1-ST2 axis controls Th2 effector function in tissue via a metabolic checkpoint\nAuthors: Heieis, G. A.; Everts, B.; Roberts, C. W.; Maizels, R. M.; Perona-Wright, G.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.553117\nType 2 immune responses characterise both helminth infections and atopic disease such as allergy or asthma, but a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate these responses is key to improving therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Immuno-metabolic studies over the last two decades have suggested T cell activation broadly requires rapid increases in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, we show that CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells activated in vivo, using models of helminth infection, do not acquire a glycolytic metabolism. Instead, we show that Th2 cells solely increase their oxidative metabolism, associated with increased fatty acid uptake. Rather than contributing directly to effector function, our data reveal that Th2 cells switch to fatty acid oxidation downstream of PD-1 signalling to promote expression of the IL-33 receptor (ST2). These data provide insight into the spatial regulation of T cell metabolism, and suggest that PD-1 blockade therapies may be effective in Th2 disorders.\nUnveiling the Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathways in Canine Demodicosis\nAuthors: Kelly, P.; McHugo, G. P.; Scaife, C.; Peters, S.; Stevenson, M. L.; McKay, J. S.; MacHugh, D. E.; Lara-Saez, I.; Breathnach, R.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552979\nCanine demodicosis is a prevalent skin disease caused by overpopulation of a commensal species of Demodex mite, yet its precise cause remains unknown. Research suggests that T cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction of regulatory T cells, and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum stress is promoting canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling pathways: eIF2, mTOR, and eIF4 and p70S6K. These pathways are involved in the modulation of Toll-like receptors, most notably TLR2, and have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis, utilizing common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages, verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities, and inflammatory response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that Demodex mites, through ER stress, unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment thereby assisting in their proliferation.\nMucosal and systemic immune dynamics associated with COVID-19 outcomes: a longitudinal prospective clinical study\nAuthors: Agrawal, M.; Flores-Torres, A. S.; Franks, J. S.; Lang, S. Y.; Fabrizio, T. P.; McNair, K. E.; Boywid, L. V.; Blair, A. J.; Hundman, C. N.; Hysmith, N. D.; Whitt, M. A.; Keating, R.; Thomas, P. G.; Webby, R. J.; Green, A. M.; Smallwood, H. S.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551867\nRationaleCOVID-19 severity varies widely; children and African Americans have low and high risk, respectively. Mechanistic data from these groups and the mucosa is lacking. ObjectivesTo quantify mucosal and systemic viral and immune dynamics in a diverse cohort to identify mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 severity and outcome predictors. MethodsIn this prospective study of unvaccinated children and adults COVID-19 outcome was based on an ordinal clinical severity scale. We quantified viral RNA, antigens, antibodies, and cytokines by PCR, ELISA, and Luminex from 579 longitudinally collected blood and nasal specimens from 78 subjects including 45 women and used modeling to determine functional relationships between these data. Measurements and Main ResultsCOVID-19 induced unique immune responses in African Americans (n=26) and children (n=20). Mild outcome was associated with more effective coordinated responses whereas moderate and severe outcomes had rapid seroconversion, significantly higher antigen, mucosal sCD40L, MCP-3, MCP-1, MIP-1, and MIP-1{beta}, and systemic IgA, IgM, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1RA, and IP-10, and uncoordinated early immune responses that went unresolved. Mucosal IL-8, IL-1{beta}, and IFN-{gamma} with systemic IL-1RA and IgA predicted COVID-19 outcomes. ConclusionsWe present novel mucosal data, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets from a diverse cohort. Based on our findings, children and African Americans with COVID-19 have significantly lower IL-6 and IL-17 levels which may reduce responsiveness to drugs targeting IL-6 and IL-17. Unregulated immune responses persisted indicating moderate to severe COVID-19 cases may require prolonged treatments. Reliance on slower acting adaptive responses may cause immune crisis for some adults who encounter a novel virus. At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSDespite the disparate outcomes for African Americans and children with COVID-19 and the vital role of mucosal immunity, the majority of mechanistic clinical studies lack these groups and mucosal assessments. To date, mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 has not been adequately described and we lack data from these understudied groups. What This Study Adds to the FieldThis was a prospective cohort study of children and adults with confirmed COVID-19. Mortality was low (2.5%). Severity outcomes were associated with African American Race, shortness of breath, fever, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. We systematically characterized viral and immune factors in the mucosa and periphery and observed that moderate and severe COVID-19 were associated with longer duration, impaired clearance, early overexuberant antibody and cytokine production that was sustained. This study demonstrates that African Americans are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and display unique mucosal and peripheral immune responses. Children with COVID-19 also had distinct immune responses. This illustrates the importance of vaccination and careful clinical oversight of these populations (e.g., lower IL-6 and IL-17 levels may diminish tocilizumab, siltuximab, secukinumab, and brodalumab efficacy). This study identified generalizable outcomes predictors, systemic IL-1RA with mucosal IL-1{beta} and IL-8, and demonstrated the utility of mucosal sampling from diverse cohorts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">More than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune cell dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment undermines the control of cancer progression. NK cells play critical roles in limiting early tumor growth and metastatic disease, however, established cancers contain a phenotypically distinct, tumor-specific NK cell compartment. The temporal dynamics, mechanistic underpinning and functional significance of this tumor NK pool remains incompletely understood. To address this, we exploited photo-labeling, combined with longitudinal transcriptomic and cellular analyses, to interrogate the fate of NK cells after tumor entry. In multiple murine cancer models we reveal that conventional NK cells are continuously recruited into tumors, but rapidly adopt a distinct phenotypic state with features associated with tissue-residency and complete loss of effector functions (including chemokine and cytokine production and cytotoxicity), within 48-72 hrs of entering the tumor. Depletion of NK cells from established tumors did not alter tumor growth, indicating that intratumoral NK cells cease to actively contribute to anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, comparable NK populations were identified in human colorectal cancers, confirming translational relevance and raising the possibility that interventions to reactivate NK cells within tissues may boost anti-tumor immunity in established cancers. Indeed, administration of IL-15:IL-15Ra complexes prevented the loss of NK cell function and improved tumor control, generating intratumoral NK cells with both enhanced tissue-residency characteristics and effector function. Collectively, our data reveals the fate of cNK cells after recruitment into tumors and provides insight into how intratumoral NK cell functions may be revived.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tissues are the site of many of the most important immunological reactions, yet the immunology of the tissues has remained relatively opaque. Recent studies have identified Foxp3&#43; regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The effect of targeted therapeutics on anti-cancer immune responses is poorly understood. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib has been reported to activate the integrated stress response (ISR) kinase GCN2, and the therapeutic effect has been partially attributed to GCN2 activation. Since ISR signaling is a key component of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) development and function, we measured the effect of dabrafenib on MDSC differentiation and suppressive activity. Our data showed that dabrafenib attenuated MDSC ability to suppress T cell activity, which was associated with a GCN2-dependent block of the transition from monocytic progenitor to polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and proliferative arrest resulting in PMN-MDSC loss. Transcriptional profiling revealed that dabrafenib-driven GCN2 activation altered metabolic features in MDSCs enhancing oxidative respiration, and attenuated transcriptional programs required for PMN development. Moreover, we observed a broad downregulation of transcriptional networks associated with PMN developmental pathways, and increased activity of transcriptional regulons driven by Atf5, Mafg, and Zbtb7a. This transcriptional program alteration underlies the basis for PMN-MDSC developmental arrest, skewing immature MDSC development towards monocytic lineage cells. In vivo, we observed a pronounced reduction in PMN-MDSCs in dabrafenib-treated tumor-bearing mice suggesting that dabrafenib impacts MDSC populations systemically and locally, in the tumor immune infiltrate. Thus, our data reveals transcriptional networks that govern MDSC developmental programs, and the impact of GCN2 stress signaling on the innate immune landscape in tumors, providing novel insight into potentially beneficial off target effects of dabrafenib.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The potential to harness regulatory T cells (Tregs) for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection has been restricted by several barriers: donor variability, manufacturing complications, and time-consuming expansion processes. These issues further complicate the use of autologous Tregs during acute disease phases or when Tregs are low in number or dysfunctional. Here we explore the potential of  off-the-shelf allogeneic Tregs, from healthy donors or universal sources, to provide a more practical solution. We discover that the efficacy of these cells is undermined by the recipients immune response, and that that rigorous matching of HLA classes I and II overcomes this barrier. Importantly, genetically manipulating HLA expression enables the use of unmatched allogeneic Tregs with in vivo efficacy. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of HLA-engineered Tregs, offering a novel, ready-to-use therapeutic avenue for treating a wide array of inflammatory diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Septic shock is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response depicted in a cytokine storm that results from invasive bacterial, fungi, protozoa, and viral infections. Non-canonical inflammasome activation is crucial in the development of septic shock promoting pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production via caspase-11 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD). Here, we show that NAD&#43; treatment protected mice towards bacterial and LPS induced endotoxic shock by blocking the non-canonical inflammasome specifically. NAD&#43; administration impeded systemic IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages via the IFN-{beta}/STAT-1 signaling machinery. More importantly, NAD&#43; administration not only improved casp-11-/- survival but rendered WT mice completely resistant to septic shock via the IL-10 signaling pathway that was independent from the non-canonical inflammasome. Here, we delineated a two-sided effect of NAD&#43; blocking septic shock through a specific inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting immune homeostasis via IL-10, underscoring its unique therapeutic potential.</p>

Immuno-metabolic studies over the last two decades have suggested T cell activation broadly requires rapid increases in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, we show that CD4&#43; T helper 2 (Th2) cells activated in vivo, using models of helminth infection, do not acquire a glycolytic metabolism. Instead, we show that Th2 cells solely increase their oxidative metabolism, associated with increased fatty acid uptake. Rather than contributing directly to effector function, our data reveal that Th2 cells switch to fatty acid oxidation downstream of PD-1 signalling to promote expression of the IL-33 receptor (ST2). These data provide insight into the spatial regulation of T cell metabolism, and suggest that PD-1 blockade therapies may be effective in Th2 disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Canine demodicosis is a prevalent skin disease caused by overpopulation of a commensal species of Demodex mite, yet its precise cause remains unknown. Research suggests that T cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction of regulatory T cells, and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum stress is promoting canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling pathways: eIF2, mTOR, and eIF4 and p70S6K. These pathways are involved in the modulation of Toll-like receptors, most notably TLR2, and have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis, utilizing common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages, verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities, and inflammatory response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that Demodex mites, through ER stress, unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment thereby assisting in their proliferation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleCOVID-19 severity varies widely; children and African Americans have low and high risk, respectively. Mechanistic data from these groups and the mucosa is lacking.

ObjectivesTo quantify mucosal and systemic viral and immune dynamics in a diverse cohort to identify mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 severity and outcome predictors.

MethodsIn this prospective study of unvaccinated children and adults COVID-19 outcome was based on an ordinal clinical severity scale. We quantified viral RNA, antigens, antibodies, and cytokines by PCR, ELISA, and Luminex from 579 longitudinally collected blood and nasal specimens from 78 subjects including 45 women and used modeling to determine functional relationships between these data.

Measurements and Main ResultsCOVID-19 induced unique immune responses in African Americans (n=26) and children (n=20). Mild outcome was associated with more effective coordinated responses whereas moderate and severe outcomes had rapid seroconversion, significantly higher antigen, mucosal sCD40L, MCP-3, MCP-1, MIP-1, and MIP-1{beta}, and systemic IgA, IgM, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1RA, and IP-10, and uncoordinated early immune responses that went unresolved. Mucosal IL-8, IL-1{beta}, and IFN-{gamma} with systemic IL-1RA and IgA predicted COVID-19 outcomes.

ConclusionsWe present novel mucosal data, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets from a diverse cohort. Based on our findings, children and African Americans with COVID-19 have significantly lower IL-6 and IL-17 levels which may reduce responsiveness to drugs targeting IL-6 and IL-17. Unregulated immune responses persisted indicating moderate to severe COVID-19 cases may require prolonged treatments. Reliance on slower acting adaptive responses may cause immune crisis for some adults who encounter a novel virus.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSDespite the disparate outcomes for African Americans and children with COVID-19 and the vital role of mucosal immunity, the majority of mechanistic clinical studies lack these groups and mucosal assessments. To date, mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 has not been adequately described and we lack data from these understudied groups.

What This Study Adds to the FieldThis was a prospective cohort study of children and adults with confirmed COVID-19. Mortality was low (2.5%). Severity outcomes were associated with African American Race, shortness of breath, fever, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. We systematically characterized viral and immune factors in the mucosa and periphery and observed that moderate and severe COVID-19 were associated with longer duration, impaired clearance, early overexuberant antibody and cytokine production that was sustained. This study demonstrates that African Americans are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and display unique mucosal and peripheral immune responses. Children with COVID-19 also had distinct immune responses. This illustrates the importance of vaccination and careful clinical oversight of these populations (e.g., lower IL-6 and IL-17 levels may diminish tocilizumab, siltuximab, secukinumab, and brodalumab efficacy). This study identified generalizable outcomes predictors, systemic IL-1RA with mucosal IL-1{beta} and IL-8, and demonstrated the utility of mucosal sampling from diverse cohorts.</p>
