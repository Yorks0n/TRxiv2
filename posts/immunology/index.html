J.; Thalin, C.\nScore: 99.8, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572575\nContinued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly. Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were. Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.\nLack of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34 in regulatory T cells leads to a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder without affecting their development\nAuthors: Courreges, C.

Inactivation of VPS34 in Treg cells led to an early, lethal phenotype, with massive effector T cell activation and inflammation, like mice lacking Treg cells completely. However, VPS34-deficient Treg cells developed normally, populated the peripheral lymphoid organs and effectively supressed conventional T cells in vitro. Our data suggest that VPS34 is required for the maturation of Treg cells or that mature Treg cells depend on VPS34 for survival. Functionally, we observed that lack of VPS34 activity impairs cargo processing upon transendocytosis, that defective autophagy contributes to, but is not sufficient to explain this lethal phenotype, and that loss of VPS34 activity induces a state of heightened metabolic activity that may interfere with metabolic networks required for maintenance or suppressive functions of Treg cells.\nEngineering self-propelled tumor-infiltrating CAR T cells using synthetic velocity receptors\nAuthors: Johnston, A.

CAR T cell therapy has enjoyed success in the clinic for hematological cancer indications, giving rise to decade-long remissions in some cases. However, CAR T therapy for patients with solid tumors has not seen similar successes. Solid tumors constitute 90% of adult human cancers, representing an enormous unmet clinical need. Current approaches do not solve the central problem of limited ability of therapeutic cells to migrate through the stromal matrix. We discover that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype is mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced inflammatory cytokines that include IL5, TNF, IFN{gamma}, and IL8. We exploit this finding to \"lock-in\" a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing receptors, which we call velocity receptors (VRs). VRs target these cytokines and signal through these cytokines cognate receptors to increase T cell motility and infiltrate lung, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors in large numbers and at doses for which control CAR T cells remain confined to the tumor periphery. In contrast to CAR therapy alone, VR-CAR T cells significantly attenuate tumor growth and extend overall survival. This work suggests that approaches to the design of immune cell receptors that focus on migration signaling will help current and future CAR cellular therapies to infiltrate deep into solid tumors.\nA mass cytometry approach to track the evolution of T cell responses during infection and immunotherapy by paired T cell receptor repertoire and T cell differentiation state analysis\nAuthors: Castillo, J. G.; DeBarge, R.; Mende, A.; Tenvooren, I.; Marquez, D. M.; Straub, A.; Busch, D. H.; Spitzer, M. H.; DuPage, M.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575237\nT cell receptor (TCR) recognition followed by clonal expansion is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses. Here, we developed a mass cytometric (CyTOF) approach combining antibodies specific for different TCR V- and V{beta}-chains with antibodies against T cell activation and differentiation proteins to identify antigen-specific expansions of T cell subsets and assess aspects of cellular function. This strategy allowed for the identification of expansions of specific V{beta} and V chain expressing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with varying differentiation states in response to Listeria monocytogenes, tumors, and respiratory influenza infection. Expanded V{beta} chain expressing T cells could be directly linked to the recognition of specific antigens from Listeria, tumor cells, or influenza. In the setting of influenza infection, we showed that the common therapeutic approaches of intramuscular vaccination or convalescent serum transfer altered the clonal diversity and differentiation state of responding T cells. Thus, we present a new method to monitor broad changes in TCR specificity paired with T cell differentiation during adaptive immune responses.\nSpatial characterization of interface dermatitis in cutaneous lupus reveals novel chemokine ligand-receptor pairs that drive disease\nAuthors: Shakiba, S.; Haddadi, N.-S.; Afshari, K.; Lubov, J.

Here, we examined chemokine ligand-receptor pairs to better understand the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a complex autoimmune connective tissue disorder. We used suction blister biopsies to measure cellular infiltrates with spectral flow cytometry in the interface dermatitis reaction, as well as 184 protein analytes in interstitial skin fluid using Olink targeted proteomics. Flow and Olink data concordantly demonstrated significant increases in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also performed spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics of punch biopsies using digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology on CLE skin and healthy margin controls to examine discreet locations within the tissue. Spatial and Olink data confirmed elevation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands. Comparing involved versus uninvolved keratinocytes in CLE samples revealed upregulation of essential inflammatory response genes in areas near interface dermatitis, including AIM2. Our Olink data confirmed upregulation of Caspase 8, IL-18 which is the final product of AIM2 activation, and induced chemokines including CCL8 and CXCL6 in CLE lesional samples. Chemotaxis assays using PBMCs from healthy and CLE donors revealed that T cells are equally poised to respond to CXCR3 ligands, whereas CD14+CD16+ APC populations are more sensitive to CXCL6 via CXCR1 and CD14+ are more sensitive to CCL8 via CCR2. Taken together, our data map a pathway from keratinocyte injury to lymphocyte recruitment in CLE via AIM2-Casp8-IL-18-CXCL6/CXCR1 and CCL8/CCR2, and IFNG/IFNL1-CXCL9/CXCL11-CXCR3. One Sentence SummaryWe mapped chemokine orchestrators of interface dermatitis in lupus using spatial approaches on archival tissue and confirmed with fresh tissues.\nAspergillus-mediated allergic airway inflammation is triggered by dendritic cell recognition of a defined spore morphotype, a process that can be targeted via antifungal therapeutics.\nAuthors: Houlder, E. L.; Gago, S.; Vere, G.; Conn, D.; Khan, S.; Thomson, D.; Shepherd, M.; Lebedinec, R.; Brown, G. D.; Bromley, M.; MacDonald, A. S.; Cook, P. C.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575032\nBackground. Exposure to fungi, especially Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.), can elicit potent allergic inflammation that triggers and worsens asthmatic disease. Dendritic cells (DCs), initiate allergic inflammatory responses to allergic stimuli. However, it is unclear if A.f. spores during isotropic growth (early spore swelling) can activate DCs to initiate allergic responses or if germination is required. This lack of basic understanding of how A.f. causes disease is a barrier to the development of new treatments. Objective. To show that a precise A.f. morphotype stage during spore swelling can trigger DCs to mediate allergic inflammatory responses and ascertain if antifungal therapeutics can be effective at suppressing this process. Methods. We employed an A.f. strain deficient in pyrimidine biosynthesis ({Delta}pyrG) to generate populations of A.f. spores arrested at different stages of isotropic growth (swelling) via temporal removal of uracil and uridine from growth media. These arrested spore stages were cultured with bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs), and their activation measured via flow cytometry and ELISA to interrogate which growth stage was able to activate BMDCs. These BMDCs were then adoptively transferred into the airways, to assess if they were able to mediate allergic inflammation in naive recipient mice. Allergic airway inflammation in vivo was determined via flow cytometry, ELISA and qPCR. This system was also used to determine if antifungal drug (itraconazole) treatment could alter early stages of spore swelling and therefore BMDC activation and in vivo allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. Results. We found that A.f. isotropic growth is essential to trigger BMDC activation and mediate allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, using time arrested A.f. stages, we found that least 3h in growth media enabled spores to swell sufficiently to activate BMDCs to elicit allergic airway inflammation in vivo. Incubation of germinating A.f. with itraconazole reduced spore swelling and partially reduced their ability to activate BMDCs to elicit in vivo allergic airway inflammation. Conclusion. In summary, our results have pinpointed the precise stage of A.f. development when germinating spores are able to activate DCs to mediate downstream allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we have identified that antifungal therapeutics can be effective in reducing the potential of A.f. spores to stimulate allergic responses, highlighting a potential mechanism by which antifungal treatment might help to prevent the development of fungal allergy.\nIron deficiency in people with obesity drives defective natural killer cell mitochondrial fitness and function\nAuthors: DeBarra, C.; Ryan, E.; Sugrue, M.; Ryan, O.; Lynn, E.; Heneghan, H. M.; McCarthy, C.; Moynagh, P. N.; Sinclair, L. V.; Jones, N.; Hogan, A.; O Shea, D.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575005\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.\nMucin-degrading gut bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity\nAuthors: Wolter, M.; Boudaud, M.; Grant, E.; Parrish, A.; De Sciscio, A.; Thompson, S.; Gerardy, J.-J.; Mittelbronn, M.; Thornton, D.

S.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482289\nBACKGROUND \u0026 AIMSHost-secreted gastrointestinal mucus plays a key role in the expulsion of intestinal nematode parasites. A balance between mucin secretion by the host and the gut microbial mucin foraging is essential to maintain the intestinal homeostasis, yet little is known about how changes in the mucin-microbiome interactions affect worm infections. Here, we aimed to examine how mucin foraging activity by the microbiome changes the course of parasitic worm infections by modulating the host immune responses. METHODSWe utilized a gnotobiotic mouse model containing a synthetic human gut microbiota that allows for: 1) a complete removal of the mucin-degrading bacteria from the community; and 2) diet-driven manipulation of the microbiota toward mucin foraging. We infected mice with a murine nematode, Trichuris muris, which resembles human infection with Trichuris trichiura. We examined the temporal dynamics of worm infection including worm burden and the host immune responses, and coupled these readouts to the microbial changes and mucin foraging activity. RESULTSThe absence of mucin-degrading bacteria in the microbiota enhances susceptibility to parasitic infection--evidenced by higher worm number--by promoting stronger Th1 immune responses. Dietary fiber deprivation increases the microbial mucin-foraging activity, which coincides with a shift in host immune responses from susceptible (chronic, Th1 type) to resistant (acute, Th2 type), thereby promoting worm clearance. CONCLUSIONSOur results provide mechanistic insights into how the colonic mucin-degrading bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity through modulation of the host immune responses. Our study documents a clinically-relevant, novel link in the microbiome-parasite-host immune axis that is useful prerequisite knowledge in managing parasitic infections.\nMultimodal profiling reveals tissue-directed signatures of human immune cells altered with age\nAuthors: Wells, S.

While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.\nMAIT cells protect against sterile lung injury\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Li, S.; Lason, W.; Greco, M.; Klenerman, P.; Hinks, T. S. C.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574631\nMucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, the most abundant unconventional T cells in the lung, have been recently linked to tissue protection and repair. Their role, especially in sterile lung injury, is unknown. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spectral analysis and adoptive transfer in a bleomycin-induced sterile lung injury, we found that bleomycin activates murine pulmonary MAIT cells and induces an accompanying tissue repair programme, associated with a protective role against bleomycin-induced lung injury. MAIT cells drive the accumulation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1), limiting tissue damage in a DNGR-1 dependent manner. Human scRNA-seq data revealed that MAIT cells were activated, with increased cDC populations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Thus, MAIT cells enhance defence against sterile lung injury by fostering cDC1-driven anti-fibrotic pathways.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly.

Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were.

Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for the maintenance of immunological tolerance, yet the molecular components required for their maintenance and effector functions remain incompletely defined. Inactivation of VPS34 in Treg cells led to an early, lethal phenotype, with massive effector T cell activation and inflammation, like mice lacking Treg cells completely. However, VPS34-deficient Treg cells developed normally, populated the peripheral lymphoid organs and effectively supressed conventional T cells in vitro.

Our data suggest that VPS34 is required for the maturation of Treg cells or that mature Treg cells depend on VPS34 for survival. Functionally, we observed that lack of VPS34 activity impairs cargo processing upon transendocytosis, that defective autophagy contributes to, but is not sufficient to explain this lethal phenotype, and that loss of VPS34 activity induces a state of heightened metabolic activity that may interfere with metabolic networks required for maintenance or suppressive functions of Treg cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells express antigen-specific synthetic receptors, which upon binding to cancer cells, elicit T cell anti-tumor responses. CAR T cell therapy has enjoyed success in the clinic for hematological cancer indications, giving rise to decade-long remissions in some cases. However, CAR T therapy for patients with solid tumors has not seen similar successes. Solid tumors constitute 90% of adult human cancers, representing an enormous unmet clinical need. Current approaches do not solve the central problem of limited ability of therapeutic cells to migrate through the stromal matrix. We discover that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype is mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced inflammatory cytokines that include IL5, TNF, IFN{gamma}, and IL8. We exploit this finding to &#34;lock-in&#34; a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing receptors, which we call velocity receptors (VRs). VRs target these cytokines and signal through these cytokines cognate receptors to increase T cell motility and infiltrate lung, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors in large numbers and at doses for which control CAR T cells remain confined to the tumor periphery. In contrast to CAR therapy alone, VR-CAR T cells significantly attenuate tumor growth and extend overall survival. This work suggests that approaches to the design of immune cell receptors that focus on migration signaling will help current and future CAR cellular therapies to infiltrate deep into solid tumors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cell receptor (TCR) recognition followed by clonal expansion is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses. Here, we developed a mass cytometric (CyTOF) approach combining antibodies specific for different TCR V- and V{beta}-chains with antibodies against T cell activation and differentiation proteins to identify antigen-specific expansions of T cell subsets and assess aspects of cellular function. This strategy allowed for the identification of expansions of specific V{beta} and V chain expressing CD8&#43; and CD4&#43; T cells with varying differentiation states in response to Listeria monocytogenes, tumors, and respiratory influenza infection. Expanded V{beta} chain expressing T cells could be directly linked to the recognition of specific antigens from Listeria, tumor cells, or influenza. In the setting of influenza infection, we showed that the common therapeutic approaches of intramuscular vaccination or convalescent serum transfer altered the clonal diversity and differentiation state of responding T cells. Thus, we present a new method to monitor broad changes in TCR specificity paired with T cell differentiation during adaptive immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chemokines play critical roles in the recruitment and activation of immune cells in both homeostatic and pathologic conditions. Here, we examined chemokine ligand-receptor pairs to better understand the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a complex autoimmune connective tissue disorder. We used suction blister biopsies to measure cellular infiltrates with spectral flow cytometry in the interface dermatitis reaction, as well as 184 protein analytes in interstitial skin fluid using Olink targeted proteomics. Flow and Olink data concordantly demonstrated significant increases in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also performed spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics of punch biopsies using digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology on CLE skin and healthy margin controls to examine discreet locations within the tissue. Spatial and Olink data confirmed elevation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands. Comparing involved versus uninvolved keratinocytes in CLE samples revealed upregulation of essential inflammatory response genes in areas near interface dermatitis, including AIM2. Our Olink data confirmed upregulation of Caspase 8, IL-18 which is the final product of AIM2 activation, and induced chemokines including CCL8 and CXCL6 in CLE lesional samples. Chemotaxis assays using PBMCs from healthy and CLE donors revealed that T cells are equally poised to respond to CXCR3 ligands, whereas CD14&#43;CD16&#43; APC populations are more sensitive to CXCL6 via CXCR1 and CD14&#43; are more sensitive to CCL8 via CCR2. Taken together, our data map a pathway from keratinocyte injury to lymphocyte recruitment in CLE via AIM2-Casp8-IL-18-CXCL6/CXCR1 and CCL8/CCR2, and IFNG/IFNL1-CXCL9/CXCL11-CXCR3.

        <p class="abstract">Background. Exposure to fungi, especially Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.), can elicit potent allergic inflammation that triggers and worsens asthmatic disease. Dendritic cells (DCs), initiate allergic inflammatory responses to allergic stimuli. However, it is unclear if A.f. spores during isotropic growth (early spore swelling) can activate DCs to initiate allergic responses or if germination is required. This lack of basic understanding of how A.f. causes disease is a barrier to the development of new treatments. Objective. To show that a precise A.f. morphotype stage during spore swelling can trigger DCs to mediate allergic inflammatory responses and ascertain if antifungal therapeutics can be effective at suppressing this process. Methods. We employed an A.f. strain deficient in pyrimidine biosynthesis ({Delta}pyrG) to generate populations of A.f. spores arrested at different stages of isotropic growth (swelling) via temporal removal of uracil and uridine from growth media. These arrested spore stages were cultured with bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs), and their activation measured via flow cytometry and ELISA to interrogate which growth stage was able to activate BMDCs. These BMDCs were then adoptively transferred into the airways, to assess if they were able to mediate allergic inflammation in naive recipient mice. Allergic airway inflammation in vivo was determined via flow cytometry, ELISA and qPCR. This system was also used to determine if antifungal drug (itraconazole) treatment could alter early stages of spore swelling and therefore BMDC activation and in vivo allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. Results. We found that A.f. isotropic growth is essential to trigger BMDC activation and mediate allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, using time arrested A.f. stages, we found that least 3h in growth media enabled spores to swell sufficiently to activate BMDCs to elicit allergic airway inflammation in vivo. Incubation of germinating A.f. with itraconazole reduced spore swelling and partially reduced their ability to activate BMDCs to elicit in vivo allergic airway inflammation. Conclusion. In summary, our results have pinpointed the precise stage of A.f. development when germinating spores are able to activate DCs to mediate downstream allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we have identified that antifungal therapeutics can be effective in reducing the potential of A.f. spores to stimulate allergic responses, highlighting a potential mechanism by which antifungal treatment might help to prevent the development of fungal allergy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND &amp; AIMSHost-secreted gastrointestinal mucus plays a key role in the expulsion of intestinal nematode parasites. A balance between mucin secretion by the host and the gut microbial mucin foraging is essential to maintain the intestinal homeostasis, yet little is known about how changes in the mucin-microbiome interactions affect worm infections. Here, we aimed to examine how mucin foraging activity by the microbiome changes the course of parasitic worm infections by modulating the host immune responses.

METHODSWe utilized a gnotobiotic mouse model containing a synthetic human gut microbiota that allows for: 1) a complete removal of the mucin-degrading bacteria from the community; and 2) diet-driven manipulation of the microbiota toward mucin foraging. We infected mice with a murine nematode, Trichuris muris, which resembles human infection with Trichuris trichiura. We examined the temporal dynamics of worm infection including worm burden and the host immune responses, and coupled these readouts to the microbial changes and mucin foraging activity.

RESULTSThe absence of mucin-degrading bacteria in the microbiota enhances susceptibility to parasitic infection--evidenced by higher worm number--by promoting stronger Th1 immune responses. Dietary fiber deprivation increases the microbial mucin-foraging activity, which coincides with a shift in host immune responses from susceptible (chronic, Th1 type) to resistant (acute, Th2 type), thereby promoting worm clearance.

CONCLUSIONSOur results provide mechanistic insights into how the colonic mucin-degrading bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity through modulation of the host immune responses. Our study documents a clinically-relevant, novel link in the microbiome-parasite-host immune axis that is useful prerequisite knowledge in managing parasitic infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immune system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, the most abundant unconventional T cells in the lung, have been recently linked to tissue protection and repair. Their role, especially in sterile lung injury, is unknown. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spectral analysis and adoptive transfer in a bleomycin-induced sterile lung injury, we found that bleomycin activates murine pulmonary MAIT cells and induces an accompanying tissue repair programme, associated with a protective role against bleomycin-induced lung injury. MAIT cells drive the accumulation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1), limiting tissue damage in a DNGR-1 dependent manner. Human scRNA-seq data revealed that MAIT cells were activated, with increased cDC populations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Thus, MAIT cells enhance defence against sterile lung injury by fostering cDC1-driven anti-fibrotic pathways.</p>
