Our understanding of lasting glucometabolic disruptions after acute COVID-19 remains unclear due to the lack of animal models for metabolic PASC. Here, we report a non-human primate model of metabolic PASC using SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (AGMs). Using this model, we have identified a dysregulated chemokine signature and hypersensitive T cell population during acute COVID-19 that correlates with elevated and persistent hyperglycemia four months post-infection. This persistent hyperglycemia correlates with elevated hepatic glycogen, but there was no evidence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and pancreas. Finally, we report a favorable glycemic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered on day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that the AGM metabolic PASC model exhibits important similarities to human metabolic PASC and can be utilized to assess therapeutic candidates to combat this syndrome.\nCellular RNA interacts with MAVS to promote antiviral signaling\nAuthors: Gokhale, N. S.; Somfleth, K.; Thompson, M. G.; Sam, R. K.; Marciniak, D. M.; Chu, L. H.; Park, M.; Dvorkin, S.; Oberst, A.; Horner, S. M.; Ong, S.-E.; Gale, M.; Savan, R.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559083\nImmune signaling needs to be well-regulated to promote clearance of pathogens, while preventing aberrant inflammation. Interferons (IFNs) and antiviral genes are activated by the detection of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Signal transduction downstream of RLRs proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the central adaptor protein MAVS. Recent work has shown that protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules providing allosteric regulation or acting as molecular guides or scaffolds. Thus, we hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. Here, we show that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacts with the 3' untranslated regions of cellular mRNAs. Importantly, elimination of RNA by RNase treatment disrupts the MAVS signalosome, including newly identified regulators of RLR signaling, and inhibits phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. This supports the hypothesis that RNA molecules scaffold proteins in the MAVS signalosome to induce IFNs. Together, this work uncovers a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights a generalizable principle of RNA regulatory control of cytoplasmic immune signaling complexes.\nWeakly supervised identification and generation of adaptive immune receptor sequences associated with immune disease status\nAuthors: Slabodkin, A.; Sollid, L. M.; Sandve, G. K.; Robert, P. A.; Greiff, V.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.558823\nAdaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires carry immune signals as sequence motif imprints of past and present encounters with antigen (immune status). Machine learning (ML)-based identification and generation of antigen-specific immune receptors is potentially immense value for public health. The ideal training data for such ML tasks would be AIR datasets, where each sequence is labeled with its cognate antigen. However, given current technological constraints, sequence-labeled datasets are scarce, contrasted by an abundance of repertoire-labeled ones - AIR repertoire datasets where only the repertoire dataset, but not the individual AIRs, are labeled. Therefore, an unmet need exists for an ML approach that enables predictive identification and generation of disease-specific novel AIR sequences using exclusively repertoire-level immune status information. To address this need, we developed AIRRTM, an end-to-end generative model using an encoder-decoder architecture and Topic Modeling (TM) that requires exclusively repertoire-labeled AIR sequencing data as input. We validated AIRRTMs capacity to identify and generate novel disease-associated receptors on several ground truth synthetic datasets of increasingly complex immune signals and experimental data. AIRRTM broadens the discovery space for immunotherapeutics by enabling the exploitation of large-scale and broadly available immune repertoire data previously deemed largely unsuitable for this task.\nProtective non-neutralizing mAbs targets conserved opsonic epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 variants\nAuthors: Izadi, A.; Godzwon, M.; Ohlin, M.; Nordenfelt, P.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560084\nAntibodies play a central role in the immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. Strong evidence has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) are important for anti-SARS-Cov-2 immunity through Fc-mediated effector functions. These nnAbs bind to epitopes that could be less subjected to mutations in the emerging variants. When protective, such nnAbs would constitute a more promising alternative to neutralizing mAbs (nAbs). Here, we show that six nnAbs retain binding to Omicron, while two nAbs do not. Furthermore, two of our nnAbs, which are protective in vivo, retained binding to XBB, XBB.1.5, and BQ.1.1. They appear to bind to conserved epitopes on the N-terminal and receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively. As a proof of concept, we show that these protective non-neutralizing antibodies retain potent Fc-mediated opsonic function against BQ.1.1 and XBB. We also show that the Fc-mediated function is further enhanced by expressing the antibodies in the IgG3 subclass and combining them into a dual antibody cocktail. Our work suggests that opsonizing nnAbs could be a viable strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nMetabolic and mitochondria alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10\nAuthors: Lopez-Ayllon, B.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induce a significant mitochondrial and metabolic reprogramming in A549 lung epithelial cells. While all four ORFs caused mitochondrial fragmentation and altered mitochondrial function, only ORF3a and ORF9c induced a marked structural alteration in mitochondrial cristae. ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induced largely overlapping transcriptomes. In contrast, ORF3a induced a distinct transcriptome, including the downregulation of numerous genes for proteins with critical mitochondrial functions and morphology. Genome-Scale Metabolic Models predicted common and private metabolic flux reprogramming, notably a depressed amino acid metabolism, and an enhanced metabolism of specific lipids distinctly induced by ORF3a. These findings reveal metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities prompted by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins that may be exploited to identify new targets for intervention. One-Sentence SummaryMitochondria and metabolic alterations induced by SARS- CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c, ORF10 in pulmonary cells unravel new targets of intervention.\nTrem2 Agonist Reprograms Foamy Macrophages to Promote Atherosclerotic Plaque Stability\nAuthors: Patterson, M. T.; Xu, Y.; Hillman, H.; Osinski, V.; Schrank, P. R.; Kennedy, A. E.; Zhu, A.; Tollison, S.; Shekhar, S.; Stromnes, I.; Tassi, I.; Wu, D.; Binstadt, B.; Williams, J. W.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558810\nObjectiveTrem2, a surface lipid receptor, is expressed on foamy macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions and regulates cell survival, proliferation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Studies examining the role of Trem2 in atherosclerosis have shown that deletion of Trem2 leads to impaired foamy macrophage lipid uptake, proliferation, survival, and cholesterol efflux. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that administration of a validated Trem2 agonist antibody (AL002a) to atherogenic mice could drive macrophage survival and decrease necrotic core formation to improve plaque stability. Approach and ResultsTo model a therapeutic intervention approach, atherosclerosis-prone mice (Ldlr-/-) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, then transitioned to treatment with AL002a or isotype control for an additional 8 weeks while continuing on an HFD. AL002a-treated mice had increased lesion size in both the aortic sinus and whole mount aorta, which correlated with an expansion of plaque macrophage area. This expansion was due to increased macrophage survival and proliferation in plaques. Importantly, plaques from AL002a-treated mice showed improved features of plaque stability, including smaller necrotic cores, increased fibrous caps, and greater collagen deposition. Single cell RNA sequencing of whole aorta suspensions from isotype and AL002a-treated atherosclerotic mice revealed that Trem2 agonism dramatically altered foamy macrophage transcriptome. This included upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and increased expression of collagen genes. In vitro studies validated that Trem2-agonism with AL002a promoted foamy macrophage oxLDL uptake, survival, and cholesterol efflux in culture. ConclusionsTrem2 agonist expands plaque macrophages by promoting cell survival and proliferation but improves features of plaque stability by rewiring foamy macrophage function to enhance collagen deposition.\nThe interaction between NLRP1 and oxidized TRX1 involves a transient disulfide bond\nAuthors: Geeson, M. B.; Hsiao, J. C.; Tsamouri, L. P.; Ball, D. P.; Bachovchin, D. A.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559829\nNLRP1 is an innate immune receptor that detects pathogen-associated signals, assembles into a multiprotein structure called an inflammasome, and triggers a proinflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. We previously discovered that the oxidized, but not the reduced, form of thioredoxin-1 directly binds to NLRP1 and represses inflammasome formation. However, the molecular basis for the selective association of NLRP1 with only the oxidized form of TRX1 has not yet been established. Here, we leveraged Alphafold-Multimer, site-directed mutagenesis, thiol-trapping experiments, and mass spectrometry to reveal that a specific cysteine residue (C427 in humans) on NLRP1 forms a transient disulfide bond with oxidized TRX1. Overall, this work demonstrates how NLRP1 monitors the cellular redox state, further illuminating an unexpected connection between the intracellular redox potential and the innate immune system.\nB cells occupy a unique, dynamic, biological niche within the human myocardium\nAuthors: Bermea, K. C.; Duque, C.; Cohen, C. D.; Bhalodia, A.; Rousseau, S.; Lovell, J.; Zita, M. D.; Mugnier, M. C.; Adamo, L.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558902\nBackgroundA growing body of evidence from animal models indicates that the myocardium hosts a population of B cells that play a role in the development of cardiomyopathy. However, there is minimal data on human myocardial B cells and their biological niche within the heart remains mostly unexplored. MethodsWe integrated single-cell and single-nuclei datasets from 45 healthy human hearts, 70 hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 8 hearts with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Interactions between B cells and other cell types were investigated using the CellChat Package. Differential gene expression analysis comparing B cells across conditions was performed using DESeq2. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity, KEGG, and GO pathways analysis. ResultsOut of 1,200,752 nuclei and 49,723 cells, we identified 1,100 B cells, including naive B cells and plasma cells. B cells showed an extensive network of interactions within the healthy myocardium that included outgoing signaling to macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes, and incoming signaling from endothelial cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This biological niche relied on both ECM-receptor interactions, cell-cell contact interactions, and paracrine interaction, it changed significantly in the context of cardiomyopathy and had disease-specific features. Differential gene expression analysis showed that in the context of DCM both naive and plasma myocardial B cells upregulated several pathways related to immune activation, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, upregulation of leukocyte extravasation and, in naive B cells, antigen processing and presentation. ConclusionsThe human healthy and diseased myocardium contains naive B cells and plasma cells, integrated in a diverse and dynamic biological niche. Naive myocardial-associated B cells likely contribute to the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy.\nMultimodal identification of rare potent effector CD8 T cells in solid tumors\nAuthors: Ray, A.; Bassette, M.; Hu, K. H.; Pass, L. F.; Samad, B.; Combes, A.; Johri, V.; Davidson, B.; Hernandez, G.; Zaleta-Linares, I.; Krummel, M. F.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559470\nAntitumor immunity is driven by CD8 T cells, yet we lack signatures for the exceptional effectors in tumors, amongst the vast majority of CD8 T cells undergoing exhaustion. By leveraging the measurement of a canonical T cell activation protein (CD69) together with its RNA (Cd69), we found a larger classifier for TCR stimulation-driven effector states in vitro and in vivo. This revealed exceptional star effectors - highly functional cells distinguished amidst progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. Although rare in growing mouse and human tumors, they are prominent in mice during T cell-mediated tumor clearance, where they engage with tumor antigen and are superior in tumor cell killing. Employing multimodal CITE-Seq allowed de novo identification of similar rare effectors amidst T cell populations in human cancer. The identification of rare and exceptional immune states provides rational avenues for enhancement of antitumor immunity.\nProximal immune-epithelial progenitor interactions drive chronic tissue sequelae post COVID-19\nAuthors: Narasimhan, H.; Cheon, I. S.; Qian, W.; Hu, S.; Parimon, T.; Zang, C.; Chen, P.; Sun, J.\nScore: 37.1, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557622\nThe long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5+ basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Hyperglycemia, and exacerbation of pre-existing deficits in glucose metabolism, are major manifestations of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Our understanding of lasting glucometabolic disruptions after acute COVID-19 remains unclear due to the lack of animal models for metabolic PASC. Here, we report a non-human primate model of metabolic PASC using SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (AGMs). Using this model, we have identified a dysregulated chemokine signature and hypersensitive T cell population during acute COVID-19 that correlates with elevated and persistent hyperglycemia four months post-infection. This persistent hyperglycemia correlates with elevated hepatic glycogen, but there was no evidence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and pancreas. Finally, we report a favorable glycemic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered on day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that the AGM metabolic PASC model exhibits important similarities to human metabolic PASC and can be utilized to assess therapeutic candidates to combat this syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune signaling needs to be well-regulated to promote clearance of pathogens, while preventing aberrant inflammation. Interferons (IFNs) and antiviral genes are activated by the detection of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Signal transduction downstream of RLRs proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the central adaptor protein MAVS. Recent work has shown that protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules providing allosteric regulation or acting as molecular guides or scaffolds. Thus, we hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. Here, we show that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacts with the 3&#39; untranslated regions of cellular mRNAs. Importantly, elimination of RNA by RNase treatment disrupts the MAVS signalosome, including newly identified regulators of RLR signaling, and inhibits phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. This supports the hypothesis that RNA molecules scaffold proteins in the MAVS signalosome to induce IFNs. Together, this work uncovers a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights a generalizable principle of RNA regulatory control of cytoplasmic immune signaling complexes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires carry immune signals as sequence motif imprints of past and present encounters with antigen (immune status). Machine learning (ML)-based identification and generation of antigen-specific immune receptors is potentially immense value for public health. The ideal training data for such ML tasks would be AIR datasets, where each sequence is labeled with its cognate antigen. However, given current technological constraints, sequence-labeled datasets are scarce, contrasted by an abundance of repertoire-labeled ones - AIR repertoire datasets where only the repertoire dataset, but not the individual AIRs, are labeled. Therefore, an unmet need exists for an ML approach that enables predictive identification and generation of disease-specific novel AIR sequences using exclusively repertoire-level immune status information. To address this need, we developed AIRRTM, an end-to-end generative model using an encoder-decoder architecture and Topic Modeling (TM) that requires exclusively repertoire-labeled AIR sequencing data as input. We validated AIRRTMs capacity to identify and generate novel disease-associated receptors on several ground truth synthetic datasets of increasingly complex immune signals and experimental data. AIRRTM broadens the discovery space for immunotherapeutics by enabling the exploitation of large-scale and broadly available immune repertoire data previously deemed largely unsuitable for this task.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies play a central role in the immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. Strong evidence has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) are important for anti-SARS-Cov-2 immunity through Fc-mediated effector functions. These nnAbs bind to epitopes that could be less subjected to mutations in the emerging variants. When protective, such nnAbs would constitute a more promising alternative to neutralizing mAbs (nAbs). Here, we show that six nnAbs retain binding to Omicron, while two nAbs do not. Furthermore, two of our nnAbs, which are protective in vivo, retained binding to XBB, XBB.1.5, and BQ.1.1. They appear to bind to conserved epitopes on the N-terminal and receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively. As a proof of concept, we show that these protective non-neutralizing antibodies retain potent Fc-mediated opsonic function against BQ.1.1 and XBB. We also show that the Fc-mediated function is further enhanced by expressing the antibodies in the IgG3 subclass and combining them into a dual antibody cocktail. Our work suggests that opsonizing nnAbs could be a viable strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antiviral signaling, immune response and cell metabolism in human body are dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induce a significant mitochondrial and metabolic reprogramming in A549 lung epithelial cells. While all four ORFs caused mitochondrial fragmentation and altered mitochondrial function, only ORF3a and ORF9c induced a marked structural alteration in mitochondrial cristae. ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induced largely overlapping transcriptomes. In contrast, ORF3a induced a distinct transcriptome, including the downregulation of numerous genes for proteins with critical mitochondrial functions and morphology. Genome-Scale Metabolic Models predicted common and private metabolic flux reprogramming, notably a depressed amino acid metabolism, and an enhanced metabolism of specific lipids distinctly induced by ORF3a. These findings reveal metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities prompted by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins that may be exploited to identify new targets for intervention.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTrem2, a surface lipid receptor, is expressed on foamy macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions and regulates cell survival, proliferation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Studies examining the role of Trem2 in atherosclerosis have shown that deletion of Trem2 leads to impaired foamy macrophage lipid uptake, proliferation, survival, and cholesterol efflux. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that administration of a validated Trem2 agonist antibody (AL002a) to atherogenic mice could drive macrophage survival and decrease necrotic core formation to improve plaque stability.

Approach and ResultsTo model a therapeutic intervention approach, atherosclerosis-prone mice (Ldlr-/-) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, then transitioned to treatment with AL002a or isotype control for an additional 8 weeks while continuing on an HFD. AL002a-treated mice had increased lesion size in both the aortic sinus and whole mount aorta, which correlated with an expansion of plaque macrophage area. This expansion was due to increased macrophage survival and proliferation in plaques. Importantly, plaques from AL002a-treated mice showed improved features of plaque stability, including smaller necrotic cores, increased fibrous caps, and greater collagen deposition. Single cell RNA sequencing of whole aorta suspensions from isotype and AL002a-treated atherosclerotic mice revealed that Trem2 agonism dramatically altered foamy macrophage transcriptome. This included upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and increased expression of collagen genes. In vitro studies validated that Trem2-agonism with AL002a promoted foamy macrophage oxLDL uptake, survival, and cholesterol efflux in culture.

ConclusionsTrem2 agonist expands plaque macrophages by promoting cell survival and proliferation but improves features of plaque stability by rewiring foamy macrophage function to enhance collagen deposition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">NLRP1 is an innate immune receptor that detects pathogen-associated signals, assembles into a multiprotein structure called an inflammasome, and triggers a proinflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. We previously discovered that the oxidized, but not the reduced, form of thioredoxin-1 directly binds to NLRP1 and represses inflammasome formation. However, the molecular basis for the selective association of NLRP1 with only the oxidized form of TRX1 has not yet been established. Here, we leveraged Alphafold-Multimer, site-directed mutagenesis, thiol-trapping experiments, and mass spectrometry to reveal that a specific cysteine residue (C427 in humans) on NLRP1 forms a transient disulfide bond with oxidized TRX1. Overall, this work demonstrates how NLRP1 monitors the cellular redox state, further illuminating an unexpected connection between the intracellular redox potential and the innate immune system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA growing body of evidence from animal models indicates that the myocardium hosts a population of B cells that play a role in the development of cardiomyopathy. However, there is minimal data on human myocardial B cells and their biological niche within the heart remains mostly unexplored.

MethodsWe integrated single-cell and single-nuclei datasets from 45 healthy human hearts, 70 hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 8 hearts with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Interactions between B cells and other cell types were investigated using the CellChat Package. Differential gene expression analysis comparing B cells across conditions was performed using DESeq2. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity, KEGG, and GO pathways analysis.

ResultsOut of 1,200,752 nuclei and 49,723 cells, we identified 1,100 B cells, including naive B cells and plasma cells. B cells showed an extensive network of interactions within the healthy myocardium that included outgoing signaling to macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes, and incoming signaling from endothelial cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This biological niche relied on both ECM-receptor interactions, cell-cell contact interactions, and paracrine interaction, it changed significantly in the context of cardiomyopathy and had disease-specific features. Differential gene expression analysis showed that in the context of DCM both naive and plasma myocardial B cells upregulated several pathways related to immune activation, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, upregulation of leukocyte extravasation and, in naive B cells, antigen processing and presentation.

ConclusionsThe human healthy and diseased myocardium contains naive B cells and plasma cells, integrated in a diverse and dynamic biological niche. Naive myocardial-associated B cells likely contribute to the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antitumor immunity is driven by CD8 T cells, yet we lack signatures for the exceptional effectors in tumors, amongst the vast majority of CD8 T cells undergoing exhaustion. By leveraging the measurement of a canonical T cell activation protein (CD69) together with its RNA (Cd69), we found a larger classifier for TCR stimulation-driven effector states in vitro and in vivo. This revealed exceptional star effectors - highly functional cells distinguished amidst progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. Although rare in growing mouse and human tumors, they are prominent in mice during T cell-mediated tumor clearance, where they engage with tumor antigen and are superior in tumor cell killing. Employing multimodal CITE-Seq allowed de novo identification of similar rare effectors amidst T cell populations in human cancer. The identification of rare and exceptional immune states provides rational avenues for enhancement of antitumor immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8&#43; T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5&#43; basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8&#43; T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.</p>
