L.\nScore: 140.2, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577193\nBackground: Humans have long shared infectious agents with cattle, and the bovine-derived human common cold OC-43 CoV is a not-so-distant example of cross-species viral spill over of coronaviruses. Human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is certainly common, as the virus is endemic in most high-density cattle-raising regions. Since BCoVs are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that cross-protection against COVID-19 occurs in people exposed to BCoV. Methods: This article shows an in silico investigation of human cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 due to BCoV exposure. We determined HLA recognition and human B lymphocyte reactivity to BCoV epitopes using bioinformatics resources. A retrospective geoepidemiological analysis of COVID-19 was then performed to verify if BCoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-protection could have occurred in the field. Brazil was used as a model for the epidemiological analysis of the impact of livestock density, as a proxy for human exposure to BCoV, on the prevalence of COVID-19 in people. Results: As could be expected from their classification in the same Betacoronavirus genus, we show that several human B and T epitopes are shared between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2. This raised the possibility of cross-protection of people from exposure to the bovine coronavirus. Analysis of field data added partial support to the hypothesis of viral cross-immunity from human exposure to BCoV. There was a negative correlation between livestock geographical density and COVID-19. Whole-Brazil data showed areas in the country in which COVID-19 prevalence was disproportionally low (controlled by normalization by transport infrastructure). Areas with high cattle density had lower COVID-19 prevalence in these low-risk areas. Conclusions: These data are hypothesis-raising indications that cross-protection is possibly being induced by human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus.\nHybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 arises from serological recall of IgG antibodies distinctly imprinted by infection or vaccination\nAuthors: Voss, W. N.; Mallory, M. A.; Byrne, P. O.; Marchioni, J. M.; Knudson, S. A.; Powers, J. M.; Leist, S. R.; Dadonaite, B.; Townsend, D. R.; Kain, J.; Huang, Y.; Satterwhite, E.; Castillo, I.

C.\nScore: 73.4, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576742\nWe used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (\"hybrid immunity\"). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with \u003e60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD \u003c 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 [~]0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.

Furthermore, traditional CAR T-cell manufacturing often involves extended cell culture periods, leading to a final product that has progressed through the differentiation process and contains a higher frequency of cells with phenotypes that are indicative of lower functionality or potency. Here, we show that anti-CD19 CAR T-cells manufactured from fresh whole blood with minimal ex vivo expansion using Ingenui-T exhibit comparable or superior CAR-mediated and CD19-dependent functional activity compared to CAR T-cells manufactured from cryopreserved leukapheresis material following the a conventional manufacturing process. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell production, manufactured from whole blood in less than 3 days of in vitro culture using Ingenui-T, yielded an average of about 40 million cells per 100 mL with high CD3 purity and viability. Furthermore, the final product was composed of cells with less differentiated phenotypes and sustained cytotoxic activity against CD19+ target cells at a lower dose than conventionally manufactured CAR T cells in preclinical in vitro assays. Ingenui-T is an innovative vein-to-vein solution, aimed at enhancing the patient experience, feasibility, and accessibility of CAR T-cell therapy by alleviating challenges linked to apheresis-based methods, with its patient-friendly nature, cost-effectiveness, and distinctive methodology.\nFull resolution HLA and KIR genes annotation for human genome assemblies\nAuthors: Zhou, Y.; Song, L.; Li, H.\nScore: 42.5, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576452\nThe HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes and the KIR (Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor) genes are critical to immune responses and are associated with many immune-related diseases. Located in highly polymorphic regions, they are hard to be studied with traditional short-read alignment-based methods. Although modern long-read assemblers can often assemble these genes, using existing tools to annotate HLA and KIR genes in these assemblies remains a non-trivial task. Here, we describe Immuannot, a new computation tool to annotate the gene structures of HLA and KIR genes and to type the allele of each gene. Applying Immuannot to 56 regional and 212 whole-genome assemblies from previous studies, we annotated 9,931 HLA and KIR genes and found that almost half of these genes, 4,068, had novel sequences compared to the current Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD). These novel gene sequences were represented by 2,664 distinct alleles, some of which contained non-synonymous variations resulting in 92 novel protein sequences. We demonstrated the complex haplotype structures at the two loci and reported the linkage between HLA/KIR haplotypes and gene alleles. We anticipate that Immuannot will speed up the discovery of new HLA/KIR alleles and enable the association of HLA/KIR haplotype structures with clinical outcomes in the future.\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the nasal compartment\nAuthors: Kar, M.; Johnson, K.

S.\nScore: 33.9, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576505\nSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and continues to pose a significant public health threat throughout the world. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are rapidly generated to form effector and memory cells and persist in the blood for several months. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection within the respiratory tract are not well understood. Using C57BL/6 mice infected with a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.351), we evaluated the role of T cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Following infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B. Using antibodies to deplete T cells prior to infection, we found that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play distinct roles in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the lungs, T cells play a minimal role in viral control with viral clearance occurring in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days post-infection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent and culturable virus replicating in the nasal compartment through 28 days post-infection. Using in situ hybridization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted in the nasal epithelial layer of tandem CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted mice. Sequence analysis of virus isolates from persistently infected mice revealed mutations spanning across the genome, including a deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nEmergence of a senescent and inflammatory pulmonary CD4+ T cell population prior to lung allograft failure\nAuthors: Moshkelgosha, S.; Levy, L.; Safavi, S.; Karunagaran, S.; Wilson, G.; Renaud-Picard, B.; Madu, G.; Ramchandani, R.; Oliver, J.; Watanabe, T.; Bei, K. F.; Joe, B.; Li, Q.; Huszti, E.; Cheung, M.; Hedley, D.; Yeung, J.; Keshavjee, S.; Martinu, T.; Juvet, S.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572416\nLung transplantation is a life-saving therapy for end-stage pulmonary disease, but its long-term outlook is poor due to a high incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD results from alloimmune-mediated progressive fibrosis and culminates in death or the need for re-transplantation after a median of 6 years. Existing immunosuppression fails to prevent CLAD, suggesting the existence of alloimmune pathways resistant to these drugs. Here, we used mass cytometry to identify cell populations enriched in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with subsequent allograft dysfunction. We show that CD4+CD57+PD1+ T cells emerge in stable lung transplant recipients in the first year post-transplant, conferring heightened risks for CLAD and death or re-transplantation. CD4+CD57+PD1+ T cells display features of senescence and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Cellular indexing by transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-Seq) on BAL CD4+ T cells revealed the existence of 2 oligoclonal CD57+ subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Finally, we observed that CD4+CD57+PD1+ T cells are associated with lung allograft fibrosis in a mouse model and in human explanted CLAD lungs, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells. Together, our findings reveal the existence of an inflammatory T cell population that predicts future lung allograft dysfunction and may represent a rational therapeutic target in lung transplant recipients.\nBlood immunophenotyping identifies distinct kidney histopathology and outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis\nAuthors: Horisberger, A.; Griffith, A.; Keegan, J.; Arazi, A.; Pulford, J.; Murzin, E.; Howard, K.; Hancock, B.; Fava, A.; Sasaki, T.; Ghosh, T.; Inamo, J.; Beuschel, R.; Cao, Y.; Preisinger, K.; Gutierrez-Arcelus, M.; Eisenhaure, T.

Identifying non-invasive, blood-based pathologic immune alterations associated with renal injury could aid therapeutic decisions. Here, we used mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 145 patients with biopsy-proven LN and 40 healthy controls to evaluate the heterogeneity of immune activation in patients with LN and to identify correlates of renal parameters and treatment response. Unbiased analysis identified 3 immunologically distinct groups of patients with LN that were associated with different patterns of histopathology, renal cell infiltrates, urine proteomic profiles, and treatment response at one year. Patients with enriched circulating granzyme B+ T cells at baseline showed more severe disease and increased numbers of activated CD8 T cells in the kidney, yet they had the highest likelihood of treatment response. A second group characterized primarily by a high type I interferon signature had a lower likelihood of response to therapy, while a third group appeared immunologically inactive by immunophenotyping at enrollment but with chronic renal injuries. Main immune profiles could be distilled down to 5 simple cytometric parameters that recapitulate several of the associations, highlighting the potential for blood immune profiling to translate to clinically useful non-invasive metrics to assess immune-mediated disease in LN.\nEstrogen-related differences in antitumor immunity and the gut microbiome contribute to sexual dimorphism of colorectal cancer\nAuthors: Lattanzi, G.; Perillo, F.; Diaz Basabe, A.; Caridi, B.; Amoroso, C.; Baeri, A.; Cirrincione, E.; Ghidini, M.; Galassi, B.; Cassinotti, E.; Baldari, L.; Boni, L.; Vecchi, M.; Caprioli, F.; Facciotti, F.; Strati, F.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576009\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifaceted disease whose development and progression varies depending on tumor location, age of patients, infiltration of immune cells within cancer lesions, and the tumor microenvironment. These pathophysiological characteristics are additionally influenced by sex-related differences. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and shapes anti-tumor immune responses but how the responsiveness of the immune system to the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of CRC is largely unknown. Here, we studied survival, tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations and tumor-associated microbiome of a cohort of n=184 male and female CRC patients and functionally tested the immune system-microbiome interactions in in vivo and in vitro models of the disease. High-dimensional single-cell flow cytometry showed that female patients are enriched by tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells but depleted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The enrichment of oral pathobionts and a reduction of {beta}-glucuronidase activity are distinctive traits characterizing the gut microbiome of women affected by CRC. Functional assays using a collection of human primary iNKT cell lines demonstrated that the gut microbiota of female patients functionally impairs iNKT cell anti-tumor functions interfering with the granzyme-perforin cytotoxic pathway. These results highlight a sex-dependent functional relationship between the gut microbiome, estrogen metabolism, and the decline of cytotoxic T cell responses, contributing to the sexual dimorphism observed in CRC patients with relevant implications for precision medicine and the design of targeted therapeutic approaches addressing sex bias in cancer.\nIL-17A/IFN-γ producing γ δ T cell functional dichotomy impacts cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice\nAuthors: Dos-Santos, J.

L.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576494\n{gamma}{delta} T cells are innate-like lymphocytes with pleiotropic roles in immune responses to pathogens, often ascribed to their IL-17A-producing or IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets. Here we investigated the impact of this functional dichotomy on cutaneous leishmaniasis, a set of neglected diseases caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. We demonstrate that in Sv129 mice susceptible to Leishmania amazonensis, V{gamma}4+ {gamma}{delta} T cells are the main source of IL-17A. Furthermore, in type 1 interferon receptor-deficient (A129) mice presenting increased susceptibility to infection, there is a higher frequency of IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells when compared to wild-type mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of L. amazonensis induces IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells. Importantly, C57Bl/6 mice deficient in {gamma}{delta} T cells or in IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA) show reduced lesion sizes, consistent with a pathogenic role of IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells in cutaneous leishmaniasis. Conversely, the adoptive transfer of FACS-sorted {gamma}{delta} T cells led to an accumulation of IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells in various susceptible strains of mice which associated with control of lesion development. These data demonstrate a pathophysiological dichotomy in which IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells promote pathogenesis, whereas IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells display therapeutic potential in cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nAcute exercise increases systemic kynurenine pathway metabolites and activates the AHR in human PBMCs\nAuthors: Joisten, N.; Walzik, D.; Schenk, A.; Metcalfe, A.

G.; Bloch, W.; Zimmer, P.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576018\nThe kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation generates several metabolites such as kynurenine or kynurenic acid that serve as endogenous ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Due to its distinct biological roles particularly modulating the immune system, the AHR is a current therapeutic target across different inflammation-related diseases. Here, we show an exercise-induced increase in AHR ligand availability on a systemic level and a kynurenine pathway activation in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). Concurrently, the AHR is activated in PBMCs following acute exercise, with effects being dependent on exercise intensity. In conclusion, these data indicate a novel mechanistic link how exercise modulates the immune system through the kynurenine pathway-AHR axis, potentially underlying exercise-induced benefits in various chronic diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Humans have long shared infectious agents with cattle, and the bovine-derived human common cold OC-43 CoV is a not-so-distant example of cross-species viral spill over of coronaviruses. Human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is certainly common, as the virus is endemic in most high-density cattle-raising regions. Since BCoVs are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that cross-protection against COVID-19 occurs in people exposed to BCoV. Methods: This article shows an in silico investigation of human cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 due to BCoV exposure. We determined HLA recognition and human B lymphocyte reactivity to BCoV epitopes using bioinformatics resources. A retrospective geoepidemiological analysis of COVID-19 was then performed to verify if BCoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-protection could have occurred in the field. Brazil was used as a model for the epidemiological analysis of the impact of livestock density, as a proxy for human exposure to BCoV, on the prevalence of COVID-19 in people. Results: As could be expected from their classification in the same Betacoronavirus genus, we show that several human B and T epitopes are shared between BCoV and SARS-CoV-2. This raised the possibility of cross-protection of people from exposure to the bovine coronavirus. Analysis of field data added partial support to the hypothesis of viral cross-immunity from human exposure to BCoV. There was a negative correlation between livestock geographical density and COVID-19. Whole-Brazil data showed areas in the country in which COVID-19 prevalence was disproportionally low (controlled by normalization by transport infrastructure). Areas with high cattle density had lower COVID-19 prevalence in these low-risk areas. Conclusions: These data are hypothesis-raising indications that cross-protection is possibly being induced by human exposure to the Bovine Coronavirus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (&#34;hybrid immunity&#34;). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with &gt;60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD &lt; 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 [~]0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.

        <p class="abstract">Apheresis, a conventional starting point for manufacturing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, poses challenges due to the length and invasiveness of the procedure, the high demand for and limited quantity of apheresis beds, and additional resource constraints at collection centers. Furthermore, traditional CAR T-cell manufacturing often involves extended cell culture periods, leading to a final product that has progressed through the differentiation process and contains a higher frequency of cells with phenotypes that are indicative of lower functionality or potency. Here, we show that anti-CD19 CAR T-cells manufactured from fresh whole blood with minimal ex vivo expansion using Ingenui-T exhibit comparable or superior CAR-mediated and CD19-dependent functional activity compared to CAR T-cells manufactured from cryopreserved leukapheresis material following the a conventional manufacturing process. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell production, manufactured from whole blood in less than 3 days of in vitro culture using Ingenui-T, yielded an average of about 40 million cells per 100 mL with high CD3 purity and viability. Furthermore, the final product was composed of cells with less differentiated phenotypes and sustained cytotoxic activity against CD19&#43; target cells at a lower dose than conventionally manufactured CAR T cells in preclinical in vitro assays. Ingenui-T is an innovative vein-to-vein solution, aimed at enhancing the patient experience, feasibility, and accessibility of CAR T-cell therapy by alleviating challenges linked to apheresis-based methods, with its patient-friendly nature, cost-effectiveness, and distinctive methodology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes and the KIR (Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor) genes are critical to immune responses and are associated with many immune-related diseases. Located in highly polymorphic regions, they are hard to be studied with traditional short-read alignment-based methods. Although modern long-read assemblers can often assemble these genes, using existing tools to annotate HLA and KIR genes in these assemblies remains a non-trivial task. Here, we describe Immuannot, a new computation tool to annotate the gene structures of HLA and KIR genes and to type the allele of each gene. Applying Immuannot to 56 regional and 212 whole-genome assemblies from previous studies, we annotated 9,931 HLA and KIR genes and found that almost half of these genes, 4,068, had novel sequences compared to the current Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD). These novel gene sequences were represented by 2,664 distinct alleles, some of which contained non-synonymous variations resulting in 92 novel protein sequences. We demonstrated the complex haplotype structures at the two loci and reported the linkage between HLA/KIR haplotypes and gene alleles. We anticipate that Immuannot will speed up the discovery of new HLA/KIR alleles and enable the association of HLA/KIR haplotype structures with clinical outcomes in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and continues to pose a significant public health threat throughout the world. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells are rapidly generated to form effector and memory cells and persist in the blood for several months. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection within the respiratory tract are not well understood. Using C57BL/6 mice infected with a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.351), we evaluated the role of T cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Following infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B. Using antibodies to deplete T cells prior to infection, we found that CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells play distinct roles in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the lungs, T cells play a minimal role in viral control with viral clearance occurring in the absence of both CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells through 28 days post-infection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, but not individually, results in persistent and culturable virus replicating in the nasal compartment through 28 days post-infection. Using in situ hybridization, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection persisted in the nasal epithelial layer of tandem CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cell-depleted mice. Sequence analysis of virus isolates from persistently infected mice revealed mutations spanning across the genome, including a deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lung transplantation is a life-saving therapy for end-stage pulmonary disease, but its long-term outlook is poor due to a high incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD results from alloimmune-mediated progressive fibrosis and culminates in death or the need for re-transplantation after a median of 6 years. Existing immunosuppression fails to prevent CLAD, suggesting the existence of alloimmune pathways resistant to these drugs. Here, we used mass cytometry to identify cell populations enriched in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with subsequent allograft dysfunction. We show that CD4&#43;CD57&#43;PD1&#43; T cells emerge in stable lung transplant recipients in the first year post-transplant, conferring heightened risks for CLAD and death or re-transplantation. CD4&#43;CD57&#43;PD1&#43; T cells display features of senescence and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Cellular indexing by transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-Seq) on BAL CD4&#43; T cells revealed the existence of 2 oligoclonal CD57&#43; subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Finally, we observed that CD4&#43;CD57&#43;PD1&#43; T cells are associated with lung allograft fibrosis in a mouse model and in human explanted CLAD lungs, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells. Together, our findings reveal the existence of an inflammatory T cell population that predicts future lung allograft dysfunction and may represent a rational therapeutic target in lung transplant recipients.</p>

Here, we used mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 145 patients with biopsy-proven LN and 40 healthy controls to evaluate the heterogeneity of immune activation in patients with LN and to identify correlates of renal parameters and treatment response. Unbiased analysis identified 3 immunologically distinct groups of patients with LN that were associated with different patterns of histopathology, renal cell infiltrates, urine proteomic profiles, and treatment response at one year. Patients with enriched circulating granzyme B&#43; T cells at baseline showed more severe disease and increased numbers of activated CD8 T cells in the kidney, yet they had the highest likelihood of treatment response. A second group characterized primarily by a high type I interferon signature had a lower likelihood of response to therapy, while a third group appeared immunologically inactive by immunophenotyping at enrollment but with chronic renal injuries. Main immune profiles could be distilled down to 5 simple cytometric parameters that recapitulate several of the associations, highlighting the potential for blood immune profiling to translate to clinically useful non-invasive metrics to assess immune-mediated disease in LN.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifaceted disease whose development and progression varies depending on tumor location, age of patients, infiltration of immune cells within cancer lesions, and the tumor microenvironment. These pathophysiological characteristics are additionally influenced by sex-related differences. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and shapes anti-tumor immune responses but how the responsiveness of the immune system to the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of CRC is largely unknown. Here, we studied survival, tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations and tumor-associated microbiome of a cohort of n=184 male and female CRC patients and functionally tested the immune system-microbiome interactions in in vivo and in vitro models of the disease. High-dimensional single-cell flow cytometry showed that female patients are enriched by tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells but depleted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The enrichment of oral pathobionts and a reduction of {beta}-glucuronidase activity are distinctive traits characterizing the gut microbiome of women affected by CRC. Functional assays using a collection of human primary iNKT cell lines demonstrated that the gut microbiota of female patients functionally impairs iNKT cell anti-tumor functions interfering with the granzyme-perforin cytotoxic pathway. These results highlight a sex-dependent functional relationship between the gut microbiome, estrogen metabolism, and the decline of cytotoxic T cell responses, contributing to the sexual dimorphism observed in CRC patients with relevant implications for precision medicine and the design of targeted therapeutic approaches addressing sex bias in cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">{gamma}{delta} T cells are innate-like lymphocytes with pleiotropic roles in immune responses to pathogens, often ascribed to their IL-17A-producing or IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets. Here we investigated the impact of this functional dichotomy on cutaneous leishmaniasis, a set of neglected diseases caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. We demonstrate that in Sv129 mice susceptible to Leishmania amazonensis, V{gamma}4&#43; {gamma}{delta} T cells are the main source of IL-17A. Furthermore, in type 1 interferon receptor-deficient (A129) mice presenting increased susceptibility to infection, there is a higher frequency of IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells when compared to wild-type mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of L. amazonensis induces IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells. Importantly, C57Bl/6 mice deficient in {gamma}{delta} T cells or in IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA) show reduced lesion sizes, consistent with a pathogenic role of IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells in cutaneous leishmaniasis. Conversely, the adoptive transfer of FACS-sorted {gamma}{delta} T cells led to an accumulation of IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells in various susceptible strains of mice which associated with control of lesion development. These data demonstrate a pathophysiological dichotomy in which IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells promote pathogenesis, whereas IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells display therapeutic potential in cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation generates several metabolites such as kynurenine or kynurenic acid that serve as endogenous ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Due to its distinct biological roles particularly modulating the immune system, the AHR is a current therapeutic target across different inflammation-related diseases. Here, we show an exercise-induced increase in AHR ligand availability on a systemic level and a kynurenine pathway activation in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). Concurrently, the AHR is activated in PBMCs following acute exercise, with effects being dependent on exercise intensity. In conclusion, these data indicate a novel mechanistic link how exercise modulates the immune system through the kynurenine pathway-AHR axis, potentially underlying exercise-induced benefits in various chronic diseases.</p>
