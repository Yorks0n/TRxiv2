However, its pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to other endemic viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon for dengue viruses. Given the recent surge in dengue cases and potential cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, this study explores the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DENV-2 infection. The study assessed the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the DENV-2 Virus. Human convalescent plasma samples collected during different waves of COVID-19 and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 were examined for their potential to cause ADE of DENV-2 infection using cell-based assays. The study found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies acquired from natural infection in humans or through experimental immunization in animals were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and had the potential to enhance DENV-2 infection in K562 and U937 cells. In-silico and in-vitro studies indicated a strong interaction between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV-2 E-protein, providing a molecular basis for these findings. This study is the first to demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cross-react with DENV-2 and can enhance its infection through ADE. These findings have implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and deployment strategies in regions where dengue is endemic. SummaryAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (RBD and Spike) showed significant cross reactivity with DENV-2 (E protein). Also, anti-SARS-CoV-2-commercial antibodies, immunised animal sera and 46 human convalescent plasma samples (from different waves of pandemic) demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV-2 infection.\nAn \"alert state\" ribosome population acts as a master regulator of cytokine mediated processes\nAuthors: Dopler, A.; Alkan, F.; Malka, Y.; Hoefakker, K.; Isaeva, O. I.; Kerkhoff, M.; Gangaev, A.; Silva, J.; Ramalho, S.; Hoekman, L.; Altelaar, M.; van der Kammen, R.; Yewdell, J. W.; Kvistborg, P.; Faller, W. J.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562425\nInflammatory cytokines are pivotal to immune responses. Upon cytokine exposure, cells enter an 'alert-state' that enhances their visibility to the immune system. Here, we identified an 'alert-state' subpopulation of ribosomes (ASRs) defined by the presence of the P-stalk. We show that ASRs are formed in response to cytokines linked to tumor immunity, and are involved in the preferential translation of mRNAs vital for the cytokine response. Mechanistically, ASRs are required for the efficient translation of transmembrane domains of receptor molecules involved in cytokine-mediated processes. Importantly, loss of the ASR prevents CD8+ T cell recognition and killing, and inhibitory cytokines like TGF{beta} hinder ASR formation, suggesting that the ASR is a central regulatory hub upon which multiple signals converge. Thus, the ASR is an essential mediator of the cellular rewiring that occurs following cytokine exposure, via the translational regulation of this process.\nDesign of universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates via immunofocusing\nAuthors: Xu, D.; Powell, A. E.; Utz, A.; Sanyal, M.; Do, J.; Patten, J. J.; Moliva, J. I.; Sullivan, N. J.; Davey, R. A.; Kim, P. S.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562364\nEbola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and poses a significant threat to global public health. Although two viral vector vaccines have been approved to prevent Ebola virus disease, they are distributed in the limited ring vaccination setting and only indicated for prevention of infection from orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) - one of three orthoebolavirus species that have caused previous outbreaks. Ebola virus glycoprotein GP mediates viral infection and serves as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe a universal Ebola virus vaccine approach using structure-guided design of candidates with hyperglycosylation that aims to direct antibody responses away from variable regions and toward conserved epitopes of GP. We first determined the hyperglycosylation landscape on Ebola virus GP and used that to generate hyperglycosylated GP variants with two to four additional glycosylation sites to mask the highly variable glycan cap region. We then created vaccine candidates by displaying wild-type or hyperglycosylated GP variants on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Immunization with these antigens elicited potent neutralizing antisera against EBOV in mice. Importantly, we observed consistent cross-neutralizing activity against Bundibugyo virus and Sudan virus from hyperglycosylated GP-Fer with two or three additional glycans. In comparison, elicitation of cross-neutralizing antisera was rare in mice immunized with wild-type GP-Fer. These results demonstrate a potential strategy to develop universal Ebola virus vaccines that confer cross-protective immunity against existing and emerging filovirus species. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEbola virus outbreaks cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. Current viral vaccines require cold-chain storage and are distributed in limited ring vaccination settings. They are only indicated for protection against orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV), one of three human-pathogenic Ebola virus species. Here we harness hyperglycosylation as an immunofocusing approach to design universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates based on Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) displayed on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Compared with wild-type GP-Fer, immunization with hyperglycosylated GP-Fer elicited potently neutralizing antisera against EBOV, and more importantly, consistent cross-neutralizing activity against the other two orthoebolavirus species. Our work shows that immunofocusing antibody responses toward conserved and neutralizing epitopes of GP represents a promising strategy for vaccine design against antigenically diverse Ebola virus species.\nAntigen-level resolution of commensal-specific B cell responses enabled by phage-display screening and B cell tetramers\nAuthors: Verma, S.; Dufort, M. J.; Olsen, T. M.; Labuda, J. C.; Kimmel, S.; Scharffenberger, S.; McGuire, A.; Harrison, O. J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562275\nInduction of adaptive immune responses to commensal microbes is critical for tissue homeostasis, and perturbation of these responses is associated with multiple chronic inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and regulation of mucosal B cells targeting commensal microbes remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of tools to identify commensal-specific B cells ex vivo. To address this, we identified immunogenic protein epitopes recognized by Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB)-specific serum antibodies using a whole-genome phage display screen and identified immunogenic proteins engaging IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Using these antigens, we generated B cell tetramers to identify and track SFB-specific B cell responses in the gut associated lymphoid tissue during natural and de novo colonization. We revealed a compartmentalized response in SFB-specific B cell activation between Peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, with a gradient of IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes along the small intestine, and selective production of IgG2b with the mesenteric lymph node chain. VDJ sequencing analyses and generation of SFB-specific monoclonal antibodies identified that somatic hypermutation drives affinity maturation to SFB derived antigens under homeostatic conditions. By combining phage display screening and B cell tetramer technologies, we now enable antigen-level based studies of immunity to intestinal microbes, which will advance our understanding of the ontogeny and function of commensal-specific B cell responses in tissue immunity, inflammation and repair.\nHuman effector CD8+ T cells with an exhausted-like phenotype control tumor growth in vivo\nAuthors: Mietz, J.; Kaulfuss, M.; Egli, L.; Opitz, L.; Munz, C.; Chijioke, O.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561856\nThe functional relevance of CD8+ T cell phenotypes in human cancer is not well established. In preclinical studies, murine CD8+ T cells exhibiting an exhausted-like phenotype have been described to have drastically decreased anticancer activity while non-exhausted TCF-1+ progenitor CD8+ T cells have been thought to be mainly responsible for driving protective antitumor responses. However, human data has mostly been correlative by nature. By establishing a novel autologous humanized mouse tumor model, we found a CD8+ dominated T cell expansion upon tumor challenge and identified tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells through expression of CD137. This subpopulation of de novo arising human CD8+ T cells displayed a highly proliferative, fully activated effector and exhausted-like phenotype with enhanced expression of exhaustion markers like PD-1, CD39 and TOX, the senescence marker CD57 (B3GAT1) and cytolytic effector molecules such as PRF1, GZMH and NKG7. Moreover, these CD137+CD8+ T cells exhibited tumor-specific clonal expansion and presented signature overlap with tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells described in human cancer. We demonstrate superior anticancer activity of this exhausted-like human CD8+ T cell subset by adoptive transfer experiments using recipients bearing autologous human tumors. Mice adoptively transferred with CD137+CD8+ T cells showed reduced tumor growth, higher CD8+ T cell persistence as well as tumor infiltration, correlating with control of human tumors. In summary, we defined effective anticancer activity of human effector CD8+ T cells with an exhausted-like phenotype, supporting clinical exploration of such cells in adoptive T cell therapies.\nThe increased hinge flexibility of an IgG1-IgG3 hybrid monoclonal enhances Fc-mediated protection against group A streptococci\nAuthors: Izadi, A.; Karami, Y.; Bratanis, E.; Wrighton, S.; Khakzad, H.; Nyblom, M.; Olofsson, B.; Happonen, L.; Tang, D.; Nilges, M.; Malmström, J.; Bahnan, W.; Shannon, O.; Malmström, L.; Nordenfelt, P.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562368\nAntibodies are central to the immune response against microbes. We have previously generated a protective IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the M protein, a critical virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we generated this antibody in all human IgG subclasses and evaluated their function. Despite significantly reduced binding, the IgG3 subclass antibody demonstrated remarkably enhanced opsonic function. We hypothesized that increased Fc flexibility could explain this improved efficacy. We engineered a hybrid IgG subclass antibody, IgGh, containing the backbone of IgG1 with the hinge of IgG3, leaving the Fabs unchanged. The IgGh maintained a similar binding ability as IgG1 while gaining the strong opsonic function seen with IgG3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the different antibodies showed altered IgG Fab-antigen interactions, reflecting the differences observed in affinity. More importantly, when the antibodies were bound to the antigen, the simulations showed that the Fc of both IgGh and IgG3 exhibited extensive movement in 3D space relative to the M protein. The increased flexibility of IgGh directly translated to enhanced opsonic function and significantly increased the protection against infection with Streptococcus pyogenes in mice. Our findings demonstrate how altering Fc flexibility can improve Fc-mediated opsonic function and how modifications in the constant domain can regulate Fab-antigen interactions. In addition, the enhanced in vivo function of a more flexible IgG provides new therapeutic opportunities for monoclonal antibodies. One sentence summaryAntibody Fc flexibility in 3D space correlates with efficient Fc-mediated phagocytosis of streptococci\nThe RNA binding protein, HNRNPA2B1, regulates IFNG signaling in macrophages\nAuthors: Mohammed Salih, M.; Weindel, C. G.; Malekos, E.; Sudek, L.; Katzman, S.; Mabry, C. J.; Coleman, A.; Azam, S.; Watson, R. O.; Patrick, K. L.; Carpenter, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562050\nHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (HNRNPA2B1) is a well known RNA binding protein but the mechanisms by which it contributes to innate immune gene regulation are poorly understood. Here we report that HNRNPA2B1 functions in macrophages to regulate IFNG (IFN-{gamma}) signaling through alternative splicing of the IFNG receptor. Specific deletion of HNRNPA2B1 in macrophages resulted in altered cytokine responses in both an endotoxic shock model and following Salmonella infection. Interestingly, while HNRNPA2B1 can function as a viability gene, we observed increased macrophage and neutrophil numbers in the KO mice following LPS induced endotoxic shock. We also discovered that HNRNPA2B1 restricts replication of Salmonella enterica in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of HNRNPA2B1 resulted in an increase in NGO transcripts, which lack a start codon, of the IFNG receptor (Ifngr) leading to lower expression of the receptor at the cell surface impacting the downstream IFNG signaling cascade. Collectively, our data highlight an important role for HNRNPA2B1 in regulating IFNG signaling and restricting intracellular bacterial pathogens in macrophages.\nImmune landscape of tertiary lymphoid structures in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade\nAuthors: Shu, D.

J.; Yarchoan, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562104\nNeoadjuvant immunotherapy is thought to produce long-term remissions through induction of antitumor immune responses before removal of the primary tumor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), germinal center-like structures that can arise within tumors, may contribute to the establishment of immunological memory in this setting, but understanding of their role remains limited. Here, we investigated the contribution of TLS to antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. We found that neoadjuvant immunotherapy induced the formation of TLS, which were associated with superior pathologic response, improved relapse free survival, and expansion of the intratumoral T and B cell repertoire. While TLS in viable tumor displayed a highly active mature morphology, in areas of tumor regression we identified an involuted TLS morphology, which was characterized by dispersion of the B cell follicle and persistence of a T cell zone enriched for ongoing antigen presentation and T cell-mature dendritic cell interactions. Involuted TLS showed increased expression of T cell memory markers and expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic and tissue resident memory clonotypes. Collectively, these data reveal the circumstances of TLS dissolution and suggest a functional role for late-stage TLS as sites of T cell memory formation after elimination of viable tumor.\nEndocannabinoids and their receptors modulate endometriosis pathogenesis and immune response\nAuthors: Lingegowda, H.; Zutautas, K. B.; Wei, Y.; Yolmo, P.; Sisnett, D. J.; McCallion, A.; Koti, M.; Tayade, C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561929\nEndometriosis (EM), characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o and wild type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization- induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.\nCell age, not chronological age, governs the dynamics and longevity of circulating CD4+ memory T cells\nAuthors: Bullock, M. E.; Hogan, T.; Morris, S.; Nowicka, M.; van Dorp, C.; Yates, A. J.; Seddon, B.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562650\nQuantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4+ effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, an established fate-mapping system, and mathematical models. Together these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4+ T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We find strong evidence that cell-age effects dominate host-age effects, and that clones become more quiescent and more persistent the longer they reside within the TCM and TEM pools. This behaviour will lead to an increasingly long-tailed distribution of clone sizes as an individual ages. Therefore, the age structure of CD4+ TCM and TEM clones can explain bulk changes in their dynamics and persistence across the lifespan.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dengue disease is highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. However, its pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to other endemic viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon for dengue viruses. Given the recent surge in dengue cases and potential cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, this study explores the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DENV-2 infection.

The study assessed the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the DENV-2 Virus. Human convalescent plasma samples collected during different waves of COVID-19 and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 were examined for their potential to cause ADE of DENV-2 infection using cell-based assays. The study found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies acquired from natural infection in humans or through experimental immunization in animals were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and had the potential to enhance DENV-2 infection in K562 and U937 cells. In-silico and in-vitro studies indicated a strong interaction between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV-2 E-protein, providing a molecular basis for these findings. This study is the first to demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cross-react with DENV-2 and can enhance its infection through ADE. These findings have implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and deployment strategies in regions where dengue is endemic.

SummaryAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (RBD and Spike) showed significant cross reactivity with DENV-2 (E protein). Also, anti-SARS-CoV-2-commercial antibodies, immunised animal sera and 46 human convalescent plasma samples (from different waves of pandemic) demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammatory cytokines are pivotal to immune responses. Upon cytokine exposure, cells enter an &#39;alert-state&#39; that enhances their visibility to the immune system. Here, we identified an &#39;alert-state&#39; subpopulation of ribosomes (ASRs) defined by the presence of the P-stalk. We show that ASRs are formed in response to cytokines linked to tumor immunity, and are involved in the preferential translation of mRNAs vital for the cytokine response. Mechanistically, ASRs are required for the efficient translation of transmembrane domains of receptor molecules involved in cytokine-mediated processes. Importantly, loss of the ASR prevents CD8&#43; T cell recognition and killing, and inhibitory cytokines like TGF{beta} hinder ASR formation, suggesting that the ASR is a central regulatory hub upon which multiple signals converge. Thus, the ASR is an essential mediator of the cellular rewiring that occurs following cytokine exposure, via the translational regulation of this process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and poses a significant threat to global public health. Although two viral vector vaccines have been approved to prevent Ebola virus disease, they are distributed in the limited ring vaccination setting and only indicated for prevention of infection from orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) - one of three orthoebolavirus species that have caused previous outbreaks. Ebola virus glycoprotein GP mediates viral infection and serves as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe a universal Ebola virus vaccine approach using structure-guided design of candidates with hyperglycosylation that aims to direct antibody responses away from variable regions and toward conserved epitopes of GP. We first determined the hyperglycosylation landscape on Ebola virus GP and used that to generate hyperglycosylated GP variants with two to four additional glycosylation sites to mask the highly variable glycan cap region. We then created vaccine candidates by displaying wild-type or hyperglycosylated GP variants on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Immunization with these antigens elicited potent neutralizing antisera against EBOV in mice. Importantly, we observed consistent cross-neutralizing activity against Bundibugyo virus and Sudan virus from hyperglycosylated GP-Fer with two or three additional glycans. In comparison, elicitation of cross-neutralizing antisera was rare in mice immunized with wild-type GP-Fer. These results demonstrate a potential strategy to develop universal Ebola virus vaccines that confer cross-protective immunity against existing and emerging filovirus species.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEbola virus outbreaks cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. Current viral vaccines require cold-chain storage and are distributed in limited ring vaccination settings. They are only indicated for protection against orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV), one of three human-pathogenic Ebola virus species. Here we harness hyperglycosylation as an immunofocusing approach to design universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates based on Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) displayed on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Compared with wild-type GP-Fer, immunization with hyperglycosylated GP-Fer elicited potently neutralizing antisera against EBOV, and more importantly, consistent cross-neutralizing activity against the other two orthoebolavirus species. Our work shows that immunofocusing antibody responses toward conserved and neutralizing epitopes of GP represents a promising strategy for vaccine design against antigenically diverse Ebola virus species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Induction of adaptive immune responses to commensal microbes is critical for tissue homeostasis, and perturbation of these responses is associated with multiple chronic inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and regulation of mucosal B cells targeting commensal microbes remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of tools to identify commensal-specific B cells ex vivo. To address this, we identified immunogenic protein epitopes recognized by Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB)-specific serum antibodies using a whole-genome phage display screen and identified immunogenic proteins engaging IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Using these antigens, we generated B cell tetramers to identify and track SFB-specific B cell responses in the gut associated lymphoid tissue during natural and de novo colonization. We revealed a compartmentalized response in SFB-specific B cell activation between Peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, with a gradient of IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes along the small intestine, and selective production of IgG2b with the mesenteric lymph node chain. VDJ sequencing analyses and generation of SFB-specific monoclonal antibodies identified that somatic hypermutation drives affinity maturation to SFB derived antigens under homeostatic conditions. By combining phage display screening and B cell tetramer technologies, we now enable antigen-level based studies of immunity to intestinal microbes, which will advance our understanding of the ontogeny and function of commensal-specific B cell responses in tissue immunity, inflammation and repair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The functional relevance of CD8&#43; T cell phenotypes in human cancer is not well established. In preclinical studies, murine CD8&#43; T cells exhibiting an exhausted-like phenotype have been described to have drastically decreased anticancer activity while non-exhausted TCF-1&#43; progenitor CD8&#43; T cells have been thought to be mainly responsible for driving protective antitumor responses. However, human data has mostly been correlative by nature.

By establishing a novel autologous humanized mouse tumor model, we found a CD8&#43; dominated T cell expansion upon tumor challenge and identified tumor-reactive CD8&#43; T cells through expression of CD137. This subpopulation of de novo arising human CD8&#43; T cells displayed a highly proliferative, fully activated effector and exhausted-like phenotype with enhanced expression of exhaustion markers like PD-1, CD39 and TOX, the senescence marker CD57 (B3GAT1) and cytolytic effector molecules such as PRF1, GZMH and NKG7. Moreover, these CD137&#43;CD8&#43; T cells exhibited tumor-specific clonal expansion and presented signature overlap with tumor-reactive CD8&#43; T cells described in human cancer. We demonstrate superior anticancer activity of this exhausted-like human CD8&#43; T cell subset by adoptive transfer experiments using recipients bearing autologous human tumors. Mice adoptively transferred with CD137&#43;CD8&#43; T cells showed reduced tumor growth, higher CD8&#43; T cell persistence as well as tumor infiltration, correlating with control of human tumors.

In summary, we defined effective anticancer activity of human effector CD8&#43; T cells with an exhausted-like phenotype, supporting clinical exploration of such cells in adoptive T cell therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies are central to the immune response against microbes. We have previously generated a protective IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the M protein, a critical virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we generated this antibody in all human IgG subclasses and evaluated their function. Despite significantly reduced binding, the IgG3 subclass antibody demonstrated remarkably enhanced opsonic function. We hypothesized that increased Fc flexibility could explain this improved efficacy. We engineered a hybrid IgG subclass antibody, IgGh, containing the backbone of IgG1 with the hinge of IgG3, leaving the Fabs unchanged. The IgGh maintained a similar binding ability as IgG1 while gaining the strong opsonic function seen with IgG3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the different antibodies showed altered IgG Fab-antigen interactions, reflecting the differences observed in affinity. More importantly, when the antibodies were bound to the antigen, the simulations showed that the Fc of both IgGh and IgG3 exhibited extensive movement in 3D space relative to the M protein. The increased flexibility of IgGh directly translated to enhanced opsonic function and significantly increased the protection against infection with Streptococcus pyogenes in mice. Our findings demonstrate how altering Fc flexibility can improve Fc-mediated opsonic function and how modifications in the constant domain can regulate Fab-antigen interactions. In addition, the enhanced in vivo function of a more flexible IgG provides new therapeutic opportunities for monoclonal antibodies.

        <p class="abstract">Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (HNRNPA2B1) is a well known RNA binding protein but the mechanisms by which it contributes to innate immune gene regulation are poorly understood. Here we report that HNRNPA2B1 functions in macrophages to regulate IFNG (IFN-{gamma}) signaling through alternative splicing of the IFNG receptor. Specific deletion of HNRNPA2B1 in macrophages resulted in altered cytokine responses in both an endotoxic shock model and following Salmonella infection. Interestingly, while HNRNPA2B1 can function as a viability gene, we observed increased macrophage and neutrophil numbers in the KO mice following LPS induced endotoxic shock. We also discovered that HNRNPA2B1 restricts replication of Salmonella enterica in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of HNRNPA2B1 resulted in an increase in NGO transcripts, which lack a start codon, of the IFNG receptor (Ifngr) leading to lower expression of the receptor at the cell surface impacting the downstream IFNG signaling cascade. Collectively, our data highlight an important role for HNRNPA2B1 in regulating IFNG signaling and restricting intracellular bacterial pathogens in macrophages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neoadjuvant immunotherapy is thought to produce long-term remissions through induction of antitumor immune responses before removal of the primary tumor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), germinal center-like structures that can arise within tumors, may contribute to the establishment of immunological memory in this setting, but understanding of their role remains limited. Here, we investigated the contribution of TLS to antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. We found that neoadjuvant immunotherapy induced the formation of TLS, which were associated with superior pathologic response, improved relapse free survival, and expansion of the intratumoral T and B cell repertoire. While TLS in viable tumor displayed a highly active mature morphology, in areas of tumor regression we identified an involuted TLS morphology, which was characterized by dispersion of the B cell follicle and persistence of a T cell zone enriched for ongoing antigen presentation and T cell-mature dendritic cell interactions. Involuted TLS showed increased expression of T cell memory markers and expansion of CD8&#43; cytotoxic and tissue resident memory clonotypes. Collectively, these data reveal the circumstances of TLS dissolution and suggest a functional role for late-stage TLS as sites of T cell memory formation after elimination of viable tumor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endometriosis (EM), characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o and wild type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization- induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Quantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4&#43; effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, an established fate-mapping system, and mathematical models. Together these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4&#43; T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We find strong evidence that cell-age effects dominate host-age effects, and that clones become more quiescent and more persistent the longer they reside within the TCM and TEM pools. This behaviour will lead to an increasingly long-tailed distribution of clone sizes as an individual ages. Therefore, the age structure of CD4&#43; TCM and TEM clones can explain bulk changes in their dynamics and persistence across the lifespan.</p>
