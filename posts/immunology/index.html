E.; Ying, B.; Liang, C.-Y.; Garcia-Salum, T.; Santana, A. C.; Caten, F. T.; Urban, J. F.; Elbashir, S. M.; Edwards, D. K.; Ribeiro, S. P.; Thackray, L. B.; Sekaly, R.-P. K.; Diamond, M. S.\nScore: 52.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575588\nAlthough vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nmRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccine lipids induce low level complement activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines: Mechanisms, effects of complement inhibitors, and relevance to adverse reactions\nAuthors: Bakos, T.; Meszaros, T.; Kozma, G. T.; Berenyi, P.; Facsko, R.; Farkas, H.; Dezsi, L.; Heirman, C.; de Koker, S.; Schiffelers, R.; Glatter, K. A.; Radovits, T.; Szenasi, G.; Szebeni, J.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575122\nMessenger RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) enabled widespread COVID-19 vaccination with a small fraction of vaccine recipients displaying acute or sub-acute inflammatory symptoms. The molecular mechanism of these adverse events (AEs) remains undetermined. Here we report that the mRNA-LNP vaccine, Comirnaty, triggers low-level complement (C) activation and production of inflammatory cytokines, which may be key underlying processes of inflammatory AEs. In serum, Comirnaty and the control PEGylated liposome (Doxebo) caused different rises of C split products, C5a, sC5b-9, Bb and C4d, indicating stimulation of the classical pathway of C activation mainly by the liposomes, while a stronger stimulation of the alternative pathway was equal with the vaccine and the liposomes. Spikevax had similar C activation as Comirnaty, but viral or synthetic mRNAs had no such effect. In autologous serum-supplemented peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, Comirnaty caused increases in the levels of sC5b-9 and proinflammatory cytokines in the following order: IL-1 \u003c IFN-{gamma} \u003c IL-1{beta} \u003c TNF- \u003c IL-6 \u003c IL-8, whereas heatinactivation of serum prevented the rises of IL-1, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-. Clinical C inhibitors, Soliris and Berinert, suppressed vaccine-induced C activation in serum but did not affect cytokine production when applied individually. These findings suggest that the PEGylated lipid coating of mRNA-LNP nanoparticles can trigger C activation mainly via the alternative pathway, which may be causally related to the induction of some, but not all inflammatory cytokines. While innate immune stimulation is essential for the vaccines efficacy, concurrent production of C- and PBMC-derived inflammatory mediators may contribute to some of the AEs. Pharmacological attenuation of harmful cytokine production using C inhibitors likely requires blocking the C cascade at multiple points.\nTranslation initiation or elongation inhibition triggers contrasting effects on Caenorhabditis elegans survival during pathogen infection\nAuthors: Ghosh, A.; Singh, J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575653\nDiverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.\nIron deficiency in people with obesity drives defective natural killer cell mitochondrial fitness and function\nAuthors: DeBarra, C.; Ryan, E.; Sugrue, M.; Ryan, O.; Lynn, E.; Heneghan, H. M.; McCarthy, C.; Moynagh, P. N.; Sinclair, L. V.; Jones, N.; Hogan, A.; O Shea, D.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575005\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.\nIRAK4 autophosphorylation controls inflammatory signaling by activating IRAK oligomerization\nAuthors: Srikanth, N.; Deliz-Aguirre, R.; Gola, D. K.; Bilay, M.; Ziska, E.; Taylor, M. J.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572799\nThe controlled oligomerization of signaling proteins is an essential feature of many inflammatory signaling pathways. An example is IL-1 receptor signaling, which relies on the oligomerization of the Death Domain (DD)-containing proteins MyD88 and IRAK family kinases. This process leads to the assembly of the Myddosome signaling complex, and disrupting assembly holds potential for anti-inflammatory treatments. However, IRAKs signaling activity is also regulated by auto-/trans-phosphorylation, and it is unclear if these processes operate at or downstream of Myddosome assembly. Here, we find that the initial stage of Myddosome assembly is solely controlled by MyD88:IRAK4 DD interactions. In later stages, IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation serves as a switch, regulating IRAK1/2/3 incorporation and DD oligomerization. Small molecule inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase activity block this later stage of assembly, explaining how they dampen inflammatory signaling. Our data reveals IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation as an energy-dependent switch activating the heterotypic assembly of IRAKs DDs and downstream inflammatory IL-1 signaling. This highlights how a signaling cascade integrates phosphorylation and protein oligomerization steps.\nCD4 T Cells Acquire Cytotoxic Properties to Modulate Cellular Senescence and Aging\nAuthors: Elyahu, Y.; Feygin, I.; Pinkas, N.; Zemer, A.; Shicht, A.; Berner, O.; Eremenko, E.; Nemirovsky, A.; Reshef, K.; Roitman, L.; Krizhanovsky, V.; Monsonego, A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575313\nAging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.\nCompetitive fungal commensalism mitigates candidiasis pathology\nAuthors: Kralova, J. S.; Donic, C.; Dassa, B.; Livyatan, I.; Jansen, P.; Ben-Dor, S.; Fidel, E.; Trzebanski, S.; Narunsky-Haziza, L.; Assaf, O.; Brenner, O.; Dafni, H.; Jona, G.; Boura-Halfon, S.; Stettner, N.; Segal, E.; Brunke, S.; Pilpel, Y. T.; Straussman, R.; Zeevi, D.; Bacher, P.; Hube, B.; Shlezinger, N.; Jung, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575358\nThe mycobiota are a critical part of the gut microbiome, but host-fungal interactions and specific functional contributions of commensal fungi to host fitness remain incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of a new fungal commensal, Kazachstania heterogenica var. weizmannii, isolated from murine intestines. K. weizmannii exposure prevented Candida albicans colonization and significantly reduced the commensal C. albicans burden in colonized animals. Following immunosuppression of C. albicans colonized mice, competitive fungal commensalism thereby mitigated fatal candidiasis. Metagenome analysis revealed K. weizmannii presence among human commensals. Our results reveal competitive fungal commensalism within the intestinal microbiota, independent of bacteria and immune responses, that could bear potential therapeutic value for the management of C. albicans-mediated diseases.\nBody-wide genetic deficiency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 14 sensitizes mice to colitis\nAuthors: Vedantham, M.; Polari, L.; Poosakkannu, A.; Pinto, R. G.; Sakari, M.; Laine, J.; Sipila, P.; Maatta, J.; Gerke, H.; Rissanen, T. M.; Rantakari, P.; Toivola, D. M.; Pulliainen, A. T.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575356\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and relapsing chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract affecting millions of people. Here, we investigated the expression and functions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 14 (Parp14), an important regulatory protein in immune cells, using a biobank IBD patient cohort as well as two mouse models of colitis, i.e., the IBD-mimicking oral dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exposure model, and the oral Salmonella exposure model. Parp14 was expressed in the human colon, by cells in the lamina propria, but, in particular, by the epithelial cells with a typical granular staining pattern in the cytosol. The same Parp14 staining pattern was evidenced in both colitis models. Body-wide genetic deficiency of Parp14 in C57BL/6N background sensitized mice to DSS colitis. The Parp14-deficient mice displayed increased rectal bleeding as well as stronger epithelial erosion, Goblet cell loss and immune cell infiltration. The absence of Parp14 did not affect the mouse colon bacterial microbiota based on PacBio long read sequencing. Also, the colon leukocyte populations of Parp14-deficient mice were normal based on flow cytometry. In contrast, we witnessed an altered transcriptional signature in Parp14-deficient mice with bulk tissue RNA-Seq. Gene Ontology (GO)-based classification of differentially expressed genes demonstrated that the colon transcriptional signature of Parp14-deficient mice was dominated by abnormalities in inflammation and infection responses both prior and after the 1-week DSS exposure. Overall, the data indicate that Parp14 has an important role in the maintenance of colon epithelial barrier integrity. The prognostic and predictive biomarker potential of Parp14 in IBD merits further investigation.\nSelf-reactive B cells traverse a perfect storm of somatic mutagenesis to cause a virus-induced autoimmune disease\nAuthors: Young, C.; Singh, M.; Jackson, K.

C.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574561\nThe unexplained association between infection and autoimmune disease is strongest for hepatitis C virus-induced cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (HCV-CV). We traced the evolution of the pathogenic rheumatoid factor (RhF) autoantibodies in four HCV-CV patients by deep single cell multi-omic analysis, revealing three sources of B cell somatic mutation converged to drive accumulation of a large disease causing clone. A sensitive method for quantifying low affinity binding revealed three recurring heavy/light chain combinations created by V(D)J recombination bound self IgG but not viral E2 antigen. Whole genome sequencing revealed accumulation of thousands of somatic mutations, at levels comparable to CLL and normal memory B cells, but with 1-2 corresponding to driver mutations found recurrently in B cell leukemia/lymphoma. V(D)J hypermutation created autoantibodies with compromised solubility. In this virus-induced autoimmune disease, infection promotes a perfect storm of somatic mutagenesis in the descendants of a single B cell.\nBlood immunophenotyping identifies distinct kidney histopathology and outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis\nAuthors: Horisberger, A.; Griffith, A.; Keegan, J.; Arazi, A.; Pulford, J.; Murzin, E.; Howard, K.; Hancock, B.; Fava, A.; Sasaki, T.; Ghosh, T.; Inamo, J.; Beuschel, R.; Cao, Y.; Preisinger, K.; Gutierrez-Arcelus, M.; Eisenhaure, T.

Identifying non-invasive, blood-based pathologic immune alterations associated with renal injury could aid therapeutic decisions. Here, we used mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 145 patients with biopsy-proven LN and 40 healthy controls to evaluate the heterogeneity of immune activation in patients with LN and to identify correlates of renal parameters and treatment response. Unbiased analysis identified 3 immunologically distinct groups of patients with LN that were associated with different patterns of histopathology, renal cell infiltrates, urine proteomic profiles, and treatment response at one year. Patients with enriched circulating granzyme B+ T cells at baseline showed more severe disease and increased numbers of activated CD8 T cells in the kidney, yet they had the highest likelihood of treatment response. A second group characterized primarily by a high type I interferon signature had a lower likelihood of response to therapy, while a third group appeared immunologically inactive by immunophenotyping at enrollment but with chronic renal injuries. Main immune profiles could be distilled down to 5 simple cytometric parameters that recapitulate several of the associations, highlighting the potential for blood immune profiling to translate to clinically useful non-invasive metrics to assess immune-mediated disease in LN.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8&#43; T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8&#43; T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Messenger RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) enabled widespread COVID-19 vaccination with a small fraction of vaccine recipients displaying acute or sub-acute inflammatory symptoms. The molecular mechanism of these adverse events (AEs) remains undetermined. Here we report that the mRNA-LNP vaccine, Comirnaty, triggers low-level complement (C) activation and production of inflammatory cytokines, which may be key underlying processes of inflammatory AEs. In serum, Comirnaty and the control PEGylated liposome (Doxebo) caused different rises of C split products, C5a, sC5b-9, Bb and C4d, indicating stimulation of the classical pathway of C activation mainly by the liposomes, while a stronger stimulation of the alternative pathway was equal with the vaccine and the liposomes. Spikevax had similar C activation as Comirnaty, but viral or synthetic mRNAs had no such effect. In autologous serum-supplemented peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, Comirnaty caused increases in the levels of sC5b-9 and proinflammatory cytokines in the following order: IL-1 &lt; IFN-{gamma} &lt; IL-1{beta} &lt; TNF- &lt; IL-6 &lt; IL-8, whereas heatinactivation of serum prevented the rises of IL-1, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-. Clinical C inhibitors, Soliris and Berinert, suppressed vaccine-induced C activation in serum but did not affect cytokine production when applied individually. These findings suggest that the PEGylated lipid coating of mRNA-LNP nanoparticles can trigger C activation mainly via the alternative pathway, which may be causally related to the induction of some, but not all inflammatory cytokines. While innate immune stimulation is essential for the vaccines efficacy, concurrent production of C- and PBMC-derived inflammatory mediators may contribute to some of the AEs. Pharmacological attenuation of harmful cytokine production using C inhibitors likely requires blocking the C cascade at multiple points.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The controlled oligomerization of signaling proteins is an essential feature of many inflammatory signaling pathways. An example is IL-1 receptor signaling, which relies on the oligomerization of the Death Domain (DD)-containing proteins MyD88 and IRAK family kinases. This process leads to the assembly of the Myddosome signaling complex, and disrupting assembly holds potential for anti-inflammatory treatments. However, IRAKs signaling activity is also regulated by auto-/trans-phosphorylation, and it is unclear if these processes operate at or downstream of Myddosome assembly. Here, we find that the initial stage of Myddosome assembly is solely controlled by MyD88:IRAK4 DD interactions. In later stages, IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation serves as a switch, regulating IRAK1/2/3 incorporation and DD oligomerization. Small molecule inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase activity block this later stage of assembly, explaining how they dampen inflammatory signaling. Our data reveals IRAK4 auto-phosphorylation as an energy-dependent switch activating the heterotypic assembly of IRAKs DDs and downstream inflammatory IL-1 signaling. This highlights how a signaling cascade integrates phosphorylation and protein oligomerization steps.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is characterized by the progressive deterioration of tissue structure and function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and, eventually, death. One prominent process in aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Although the immune system has been recognized as crucial for the elimination of senescent cells, the associated mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that CD4 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a senescent cell-rich environment and that a reduction in the senescent cell load, achieved using chemical senolytic drugs, was sufficient to halt this differentiation. We further demonstrate that eliminating CD4 CTLs in the context of late aging by selectively deleting the Eomes transcription factor in CD4 T cells resulted in the increased accumulation of senescent cells, profound physical deterioration, and a decreased life span. In liver cirrhosis, a model of localized chronic inflammation, CD4 CTL elimination increased the senescent load and worsened the disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of CD4 CTLs in modulating tissue senescence and unveil a new aspect of age-related T-cell biology implicated in disease susceptibility and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mycobiota are a critical part of the gut microbiome, but host-fungal interactions and specific functional contributions of commensal fungi to host fitness remain incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of a new fungal commensal, Kazachstania heterogenica var. weizmannii, isolated from murine intestines. K. weizmannii exposure prevented Candida albicans colonization and significantly reduced the commensal C. albicans burden in colonized animals. Following immunosuppression of C. albicans colonized mice, competitive fungal commensalism thereby mitigated fatal candidiasis. Metagenome analysis revealed K. weizmannii presence among human commensals. Our results reveal competitive fungal commensalism within the intestinal microbiota, independent of bacteria and immune responses, that could bear potential therapeutic value for the management of C. albicans-mediated diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and relapsing chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract affecting millions of people. Here, we investigated the expression and functions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 14 (Parp14), an important regulatory protein in immune cells, using a biobank IBD patient cohort as well as two mouse models of colitis, i.e., the IBD-mimicking oral dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exposure model, and the oral Salmonella exposure model. Parp14 was expressed in the human colon, by cells in the lamina propria, but, in particular, by the epithelial cells with a typical granular staining pattern in the cytosol. The same Parp14 staining pattern was evidenced in both colitis models. Body-wide genetic deficiency of Parp14 in C57BL/6N background sensitized mice to DSS colitis. The Parp14-deficient mice displayed increased rectal bleeding as well as stronger epithelial erosion, Goblet cell loss and immune cell infiltration. The absence of Parp14 did not affect the mouse colon bacterial microbiota based on PacBio long read sequencing. Also, the colon leukocyte populations of Parp14-deficient mice were normal based on flow cytometry. In contrast, we witnessed an altered transcriptional signature in Parp14-deficient mice with bulk tissue RNA-Seq. Gene Ontology (GO)-based classification of differentially expressed genes demonstrated that the colon transcriptional signature of Parp14-deficient mice was dominated by abnormalities in inflammation and infection responses both prior and after the 1-week DSS exposure. Overall, the data indicate that Parp14 has an important role in the maintenance of colon epithelial barrier integrity. The prognostic and predictive biomarker potential of Parp14 in IBD merits further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The unexplained association between infection and autoimmune disease is strongest for hepatitis C virus-induced cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (HCV-CV). We traced the evolution of the pathogenic rheumatoid factor (RhF) autoantibodies in four HCV-CV patients by deep single cell multi-omic analysis, revealing three sources of B cell somatic mutation converged to drive accumulation of a large disease causing clone. A sensitive method for quantifying low affinity binding revealed three recurring heavy/light chain combinations created by V(D)J recombination bound self IgG but not viral E2 antigen. Whole genome sequencing revealed accumulation of thousands of somatic mutations, at levels comparable to CLL and normal memory B cells, but with 1-2 corresponding to driver mutations found recurrently in B cell leukemia/lymphoma. V(D)J hypermutation created autoantibodies with compromised solubility. In this virus-induced autoimmune disease, infection promotes a perfect storm of somatic mutagenesis in the descendants of a single B cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and fewer than half of patients achieve complete renal response with standard immunosuppressants. Identifying non-invasive, blood-based pathologic immune alterations associated with renal injury could aid therapeutic decisions. Here, we used mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 145 patients with biopsy-proven LN and 40 healthy controls to evaluate the heterogeneity of immune activation in patients with LN and to identify correlates of renal parameters and treatment response. Unbiased analysis identified 3 immunologically distinct groups of patients with LN that were associated with different patterns of histopathology, renal cell infiltrates, urine proteomic profiles, and treatment response at one year. Patients with enriched circulating granzyme B&#43; T cells at baseline showed more severe disease and increased numbers of activated CD8 T cells in the kidney, yet they had the highest likelihood of treatment response. A second group characterized primarily by a high type I interferon signature had a lower likelihood of response to therapy, while a third group appeared immunologically inactive by immunophenotyping at enrollment but with chronic renal injuries. Main immune profiles could be distilled down to 5 simple cytometric parameters that recapitulate several of the associations, highlighting the potential for blood immune profiling to translate to clinically useful non-invasive metrics to assess immune-mediated disease in LN.</p>
