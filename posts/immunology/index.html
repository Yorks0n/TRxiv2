However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.\np97/VCP targets Toxoplasma gondii vacuoles for parasite restriction in interferon-stimulated human cells\nAuthors: Clough, B.; Fisch, D.; Mize, T. H.; Encheva, V.; Snijders, A.; Frickel, E.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545566\nInfection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to production of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) that stimulates cells to upregulate defence proteins targeting the parasite for cell intrinsic elimination or growth restriction. Various host defence mechanisms operate at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in different human cell types leading to PV disruption, acidification, or membrane envelopment. Ubiquitin and p62 are players in all human host control mechanisms of Toxoplasma, but other unifying proteins have not been identified. Here, we show that p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), as well as its associated proteins ANKRD13A and UBXD1 control Toxoplasma infection while recruited to the PV in IFN{gamma}-stimulated endothelial cells. Convergent deposition of ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 onto the same vacuole is dependent on vacuolar ubiquitination and observed within 2h post-infection. ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 all drive the acidification mechanism of the vacuole, which is the IFN{gamma}-dependent control pathway of Toxoplasma in endothelial cells. We assessed p97/VCP in Toxoplasma control in various human cells and demonstrate that p97/VCP is a universal IFN{gamma}-dependent host restriction factor targeting the Toxoplasma PV in epithelial (HeLa) and endothelial cells (HUVEC), fibroblasts (HFF) and macrophages (THP1).\nMolecular Pixelation: Single cell spatial proteomics by sequencing\nAuthors: Karlsson, F.; Kallas, T.; Thiagarajan, D.; Karlsson, M.; Schweitzer, M.; Navarro, J.

M.; Fredriksson, S.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-06-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543770\nThe spatial distribution of cell surface proteins govern vital processes of the immune system such as inter-cell communication and mobility. However, tools for studying these at high multiplexing scale, resolution, and throughput needed to drive novel discoveries are lacking. We present Molecular Pixelation, a DNA-sequencing based method for single cell analysis to quantify protein abundance, spatial distribution, and colocalization of targeted proteins using Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs). Relative locations of AOCs are inferred by sequentially associating these into local neighborhoods using DNA-pixels containing unique pixel identifier (UPI) sequences, forming \u003e1,000 connected spatial zones per single cell in three dimensions. DNA-sequencing reads are computationally arranged into spatial single cell maps for 76 proteins without cell compartmentalization. By studying immune cell dynamics and using spatial statistics on graph representations of the data, previously known and novel patterns of protein spatial polarization and co-localization were found in chemokine-stimulated T-cells.\nUsing CombiCells, a platform enabling titration and combinatorial display of cell surface ligands, to investigate the sensitivity and costimulatory requirements of TCRs and CARs\nAuthors: Patel, A.; Andre, V.; Bustamante Eguiguren, S.; Barton, M. I.; Denham, E. M.; Pettmann, J.; Morch, A. M.; Kutuzov, M.; Siller-Farfan, J. A.; Dustin, M. L.; van der Merwe, P. A.; Dushek, O.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2023-06-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545075\nReceptor/ligand interactions at cellular interfaces are ubiquitous and the integrated signals from multiple interactions determines cellular decision-making. However, our understanding of cell-cell recognition is hampered by the inherent difficulty in precisely controlling the density of cell-surface ligands. Here, we adapt the protein Spycatcher, which forms a spontaneous covalent bond with Spytag, to enable the presentation of native ligands on cells. By expressing Spycatcher on the surface of cells using a short membrane-anchoring hinge, we show that addition of different concentrations/combinations of purified Spytag-ligands allows for the combinatorial display of ligands on cells (CombiCells) within minutes. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by quantifying T cell antigen sensitivity and the contribution of the CD2, LFA-1, CD28, and PD-1 accessory receptors. We show that T cell recognition of pMHC antigens is enhanced mostly by CD2/ligand engagement whereas recognition of the antigen CD19 by CAR-T cells is enhanced mostly by LFA-1/ligand engagement. Moreover, we show that PD-1/ligand engagement can inhibit T cell activation triggered solely by TCR/pMHC interactions, as well as the amplified activation induced by CD2 and CD28 co-stimulation. The ability to easily produce cells with different concentrations and combinations of ligands should accelerate our understanding of how receptor/ligand interactions at cellular interfaces control cellular decisions.

Here, we use antigenic cartography to analyze patterns of cross-reactivity among a panel of 21 variants and 15 groups of human sera obtained following primary infection with 10 different variants or after mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 vaccination. We find antigenic differences among pre-Omicron variants caused by substitutions at spike protein positions 417, 452, 484, and 501. Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and \u003e3 months post-2nd dose. We find changes in immunodominance of different spike regions depending on the variant an individual was first exposed to, with implications for variant risk assessment and vaccine strain selection.

J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-06-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.03.543556\nGanglioside sugars, as Tumour-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs), are long-proposed targets for vaccination and therapeutic antibody production, but their self-like character imparts immunorecessive characteristics that classical vaccination approaches have to date failed to overcome. One prominent TACA, the glycan component of ganglioside GM3 (GM3g), is over-expressed on diverse tumours. To probe the limits of glycan tolerance, we used protein editing methods to display GM3g in systematically varied non-native presentation modes by attachment to carrier protein lysine sidechains using diverse chemical linkers. We report here that such presentation creates glycoconjugates that are strongly immunogenic in mice and elicit robust antigen-specific IgG responses specific to GM3g. Characterisation of this response by antigen-specific B cell cloning and phylogenetic and functional analyses suggests that such display enables the engagement of a highly restricted naive B cell class with a defined germline configuration dominated by members of the IGHV2 subgroup. Strikingly, structural analysis reveals that glycan features appear to be recognised primarily by antibody CDRH1/2, and despite the presence of an antigen-specific Th response and B cell somatic hypermutation, we found no evidence of affinity maturation towards the antigen. Together these findings suggest a reach-through model in which glycans, when displayed in non-self formats of sufficient distance from a conjugate backbone, may engage glycan ready V-region motifs encoded in the germline. Structural constraints define why, despite engaging the trisaccharide, antibodies do not bind natively-presented glycans, such as when linked to lipid GM3. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-standing difficulties in raising antibodies reactive with native TACAs, and provide a possible template for rational vaccine design against this and other TACA antigens.

C_LIO_LIStructural characterisation of the antibody response to LOGs reveals highly restricted germline-encoded glycan-engaging motifs that mediate GM3g recognition.

Here, we employed the Th17 adoptive transfer EAE model, which features formation of large, numerous eLFs, to analyze the cellular processes within these structures. We show that clusters of activated B cells and B1/Marginal Zone-like B cells are overrepresented in the CNS and identified B cells poised for undergoing antigen-driven germinal center (GC) reactions and clonal expansion in the CNS. Furthermore, we found evidence for enhanced capacity for antigen presentation and immunological synapse formation in CNS B cells. To visualize Th17:B cell communication in eLFs, we labeled Th17 cells with a ratiometric calcium sensor, allowing us to study their interactions with tdTomato-labeled B cells in real-time using intravital microscopy of the CNS. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that there is extensive communication and long-lasting contacts between T and B cells in meningeal eLFs, and that B cells are able to reactivate T cells. Consistent with these findings, we show that CNS T cells depend on CNS B cells to maintain a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Our data suggest that interaction of T and B cells in meningeal eLFs in our model not only promotes differentiation and clonal expansion of B cells, but also leads to reactivation of CNS T cells and thereby supports smoldering inflammatory processes within the CNS. Thus, our results may provide a direction for future research into the function of eLFs in MS.\nPurinergic Preconditioning Induces Epigenomic and Transcriptomic Changes Resembling Epilepsy-associated Microglial States\nAuthors: Martins-Ferreira, R.; Calafell-Segura, J.; Chaves, J.; Ciudad, L.; Martins da Silva, A.; Pinho e Costa, P.; Leal, B.; Ballestar, E.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545837\nMicroglia, as the main immune effector cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in a diverse range of neuropathological conditions through their exacerbated activation. Microglial inflammatory responses can be influenced by prior exposures to noxious stimuli, such as increased levels of extracellular adenosine and ATP. These conditions are characteristic of brain insults like epileptic seizures and could potentially shape subsequent responses through epigenetic regulation. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation and expression changes in microglia-like cells differentiated from monocytes following ATP-mediated preconditioning. First, during differentiation, we demonstrate that microglia-like cells acquire standard microglial features, including whole transcriptomes and methylomes like in vivo profiles. We show a predominant DNA demethylation in genomic sequences enriched in binding motifs of microglia lineage transcription factors like PU.1, consistent with the relevance of this factor in in vivo microglia. TLR-mediated activation, after a first exposure to ATP, promotes exacerbated pro-inflammatory activation compared to cells not pre-exposed to ATP. These changes are accompanied by DNA methylation and transcriptional reprogramming associated with the acquisition of trained immunity and altered immune-related functions such as with antigen presentation, phagocytosis and cytokine signaling. Finally, the reprogramming associated with ATP-mediated preconditioning leads to profiles found in microglial subsets linked to epilepsy. Purine-driven microglia immune preconditioning drives epigenetic and transcriptional changes that could contribute to altered functions of microglia during seizure development and progression, particularly associated with neuroinflammation.\nA Chicken Tapasin ortholog can chaperone empty HLA molecules independently of other peptide-loading components\nAuthors: Papadaki, G. F.; Woodward, C. H.; Young, M. C.; Winters, T. J.; Burslem, G. M.; Sgourakis, N. G.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546255\nHuman Tapasin (hTapasin) is the main chaperone of MHC-I molecules, enabling peptide loading and antigen repertoire optimization across HLA allotypes. However, it is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen as part of the protein loading complex (PLC) and therefore is highly unstable when expressed in recombinant form. Additional stabilizing co-factors such as ERp57 are required to catalyze peptide exchange in vitro, limiting uses for the generation of pMHC-I molecules of desired antigen specificities. Here, we show that the chicken Tapasin (chTapasin) ortholog can be expressed recombinantly at high yields in stable form, independently of co-chaperones. chTapasin can bind the human HLA-B*37:01 with low micromolar-range affinity to form a stable tertiary complex. Biophysical characterization by methyl-based NMR methods reveals that chTapasin recognizes a conserved {beta}2m epitope on HLA-B*37:01, consistent with previously solved X-ray structures of hTapasin. Finally, we provide evidence that the B*37:01/chTapasin complex is peptide-receptive and can be dissociated upon binding of high-affinity peptides. Our results highlight the use of chTapasin as a stable scaffold for future protein engineering applications aiming to expand the ligand exchange function on human MHC I and MHC like molecules.\nBlockade of IKK signaling induces RIPK1-independent apoptosis in human cells\nAuthors: Nataraj, N. M.; Herrmann, B.; Shin, S.; Brodsky, I. E.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545781\nRegulated cell death in response to microbial infection plays an important role in immune defense and is triggered by pathogen disruption of essential cellular pathways. Gramnegative bacterial pathogens in the Yersinia genus disrupt NF-{kappa}B signaling via translocated effectors injected by a type III secretion system (T3SS), thereby preventing induction of cytokine production and antimicrobial defense. In murine models of infection, Yersinia blockade of NF-{kappa}B signaling triggers cell-extrinsic apoptosis through Receptor Interacting Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1) and caspase-8, which is required for bacterial clearance and host survival. Unexpectedly, we find that human macrophages undergo apoptosis independently of RIPK1 in response to Yersinia or chemical blockade of IKK/{beta}. Instead, IKK blockade led to decreased cFLIP expression, and overexpression of cFLIP contributed to protection from IKK blockade-induced apoptosis in human macrophages. Importantly, IKK blockade also induces RIPK1 kinase-independent apoptosis in human T cells and human pancreatic cells. Altogether, our data indicate that, in contrast to murine cells, blockade of IKK activity in human cells triggers a distinct apoptosis pathway that is independent of RIPK1. These findings have implications for the contribution of RIPK1 to cell death in humans and the efficacy of RIPK1 inhibition in human diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to production of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) that stimulates cells to upregulate defence proteins targeting the parasite for cell intrinsic elimination or growth restriction. Various host defence mechanisms operate at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in different human cell types leading to PV disruption, acidification, or membrane envelopment. Ubiquitin and p62 are players in all human host control mechanisms of Toxoplasma, but other unifying proteins have not been identified. Here, we show that p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), as well as its associated proteins ANKRD13A and UBXD1 control Toxoplasma infection while recruited to the PV in IFN{gamma}-stimulated endothelial cells. Convergent deposition of ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 onto the same vacuole is dependent on vacuolar ubiquitination and observed within 2h post-infection. ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 all drive the acidification mechanism of the vacuole, which is the IFN{gamma}-dependent control pathway of Toxoplasma in endothelial cells. We assessed p97/VCP in Toxoplasma control in various human cells and demonstrate that p97/VCP is a universal IFN{gamma}-dependent host restriction factor targeting the Toxoplasma PV in epithelial (HeLa) and endothelial cells (HUVEC), fibroblasts (HFF) and macrophages (THP1).</p>

        <p class="abstract">The spatial distribution of cell surface proteins govern vital processes of the immune system such as inter-cell communication and mobility. However, tools for studying these at high multiplexing scale, resolution, and throughput needed to drive novel discoveries are lacking. We present Molecular Pixelation, a DNA-sequencing based method for single cell analysis to quantify protein abundance, spatial distribution, and colocalization of targeted proteins using Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs). Relative locations of AOCs are inferred by sequentially associating these into local neighborhoods using DNA-pixels containing unique pixel identifier (UPI) sequences, forming &gt;1,000 connected spatial zones per single cell in three dimensions. DNA-sequencing reads are computationally arranged into spatial single cell maps for 76 proteins without cell compartmentalization. By studying immune cell dynamics and using spatial statistics on graph representations of the data, previously known and novel patterns of protein spatial polarization and co-localization were found in chemokine-stimulated T-cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Receptor/ligand interactions at cellular interfaces are ubiquitous and the integrated signals from multiple interactions determines cellular decision-making. However, our understanding of cell-cell recognition is hampered by the inherent difficulty in precisely controlling the density of cell-surface ligands. Here, we adapt the protein Spycatcher, which forms a spontaneous covalent bond with Spytag, to enable the presentation of native ligands on cells. By expressing Spycatcher on the surface of cells using a short membrane-anchoring hinge, we show that addition of different concentrations/combinations of purified Spytag-ligands allows for the combinatorial display of ligands on cells (CombiCells) within minutes. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by quantifying T cell antigen sensitivity and the contribution of the CD2, LFA-1, CD28, and PD-1 accessory receptors. We show that T cell recognition of pMHC antigens is enhanced mostly by CD2/ligand engagement whereas recognition of the antigen CD19 by CAR-T cells is enhanced mostly by LFA-1/ligand engagement. Moreover, we show that PD-1/ligand engagement can inhibit T cell activation triggered solely by TCR/pMHC interactions, as well as the amplified activation induced by CD2 and CD28 co-stimulation. The ability to easily produce cells with different concentrations and combinations of ligands should accelerate our understanding of how receptor/ligand interactions at cellular interfaces control cellular decisions.

        <p class="abstract">During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple variants escaping pre-existing immunity emerged, causing concerns about continued protection. Here, we use antigenic cartography to analyze patterns of cross-reactivity among a panel of 21 variants and 15 groups of human sera obtained following primary infection with 10 different variants or after mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 vaccination. We find antigenic differences among pre-Omicron variants caused by substitutions at spike protein positions 417, 452, 484, and 501. Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and &gt;3 months post-2nd dose. We find changes in immunodominance of different spike regions depending on the variant an individual was first exposed to, with implications for variant risk assessment and vaccine strain selection.

        <p class="abstract">Ganglioside sugars, as Tumour-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs), are long-proposed targets for vaccination and therapeutic antibody production, but their self-like character imparts immunorecessive characteristics that classical vaccination approaches have to date failed to overcome. One prominent TACA, the glycan component of ganglioside GM3 (GM3g), is over-expressed on diverse tumours. To probe the limits of glycan tolerance, we used protein editing methods to display GM3g in systematically varied non-native presentation modes by attachment to carrier protein lysine sidechains using diverse chemical linkers. We report here that such presentation creates glycoconjugates that are strongly immunogenic in mice and elicit robust antigen-specific IgG responses specific to GM3g. Characterisation of this response by antigen-specific B cell cloning and phylogenetic and functional analyses suggests that such display enables the engagement of a highly restricted naive B cell class with a defined germline configuration dominated by members of the IGHV2 subgroup. Strikingly, structural analysis reveals that glycan features appear to be recognised primarily by antibody CDRH1/2, and despite the presence of an antigen-specific Th response and B cell somatic hypermutation, we found no evidence of affinity maturation towards the antigen. Together these findings suggest a  reach-through model in which glycans, when displayed in non-self formats of sufficient distance from a conjugate backbone, may engage  glycan ready V-region motifs encoded in the germline. Structural constraints define why, despite engaging the trisaccharide, antibodies do not bind natively-presented glycans, such as when linked to lipid GM3. Our findings provide an explanation for the long-standing difficulties in raising antibodies reactive with native TACAs, and provide a possible template for rational vaccine design against this and other TACA antigens.

        <p class="abstract">Meningeal ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures (eLFs) have been described in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but the cellular processes within and their role in CNS autoimmunity is not clearly understood. Here, we employed the Th17 adoptive transfer EAE model, which features formation of large, numerous eLFs, to analyze the cellular processes within these structures. We show that clusters of activated B cells and B1/Marginal Zone-like B cells are overrepresented in the CNS and identified B cells poised for undergoing antigen-driven germinal center (GC) reactions and clonal expansion in the CNS. Furthermore, we found evidence for enhanced capacity for antigen presentation and immunological synapse formation in CNS B cells. To visualize Th17:B cell communication in eLFs, we labeled Th17 cells with a ratiometric calcium sensor, allowing us to study their interactions with tdTomato-labeled B cells in real-time using intravital microscopy of the CNS. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that there is extensive communication and long-lasting contacts between T and B cells in meningeal eLFs, and that B cells are able to reactivate T cells. Consistent with these findings, we show that CNS T cells depend on CNS B cells to maintain a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Our data suggest that interaction of T and B cells in meningeal eLFs in our model not only promotes differentiation and clonal expansion of B cells, but also leads to reactivation of CNS T cells and thereby supports smoldering inflammatory processes within the CNS. Thus, our results may provide a direction for future research into the function of eLFs in MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microglia, as the main immune effector cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in a diverse range of neuropathological conditions through their exacerbated activation. Microglial inflammatory responses can be influenced by prior exposures to noxious stimuli, such as increased levels of extracellular adenosine and ATP. These conditions are characteristic of brain insults like epileptic seizures and could potentially shape subsequent responses through epigenetic regulation. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation and expression changes in microglia-like cells differentiated from monocytes following ATP-mediated preconditioning. First, during differentiation, we demonstrate that microglia-like cells acquire standard microglial features, including whole transcriptomes and methylomes like in vivo profiles. We show a predominant DNA demethylation in genomic sequences enriched in binding motifs of microglia lineage transcription factors like PU.1, consistent with the relevance of this factor in in vivo microglia. TLR-mediated activation, after a first exposure to ATP, promotes exacerbated pro-inflammatory activation compared to cells not pre-exposed to ATP. These changes are accompanied by DNA methylation and transcriptional reprogramming associated with the acquisition of trained immunity and altered immune-related functions such as with antigen presentation, phagocytosis and cytokine signaling. Finally, the reprogramming associated with ATP-mediated preconditioning leads to profiles found in microglial subsets linked to epilepsy. Purine-driven microglia immune preconditioning drives epigenetic and transcriptional changes that could contribute to altered functions of microglia during seizure development and progression, particularly associated with neuroinflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human Tapasin (hTapasin) is the main chaperone of MHC-I molecules, enabling peptide loading and antigen repertoire optimization across HLA allotypes. However, it is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen as part of the protein loading complex (PLC) and therefore is highly unstable when expressed in recombinant form. Additional stabilizing co-factors such as ERp57 are required to catalyze peptide exchange in vitro, limiting uses for the generation of pMHC-I molecules of desired antigen specificities. Here, we show that the chicken Tapasin (chTapasin) ortholog can be expressed recombinantly at high yields in stable form, independently of co-chaperones. chTapasin can bind the human HLA-B*37:01 with low micromolar-range affinity to form a stable tertiary complex. Biophysical characterization by methyl-based NMR methods reveals that chTapasin recognizes a conserved {beta}2m epitope on HLA-B*37:01, consistent with previously solved X-ray structures of hTapasin. Finally, we provide evidence that the B*37:01/chTapasin complex is peptide-receptive and can be dissociated upon binding of high-affinity peptides. Our results highlight the use of chTapasin as a stable scaffold for future protein engineering applications aiming to expand the ligand exchange function on human MHC I and MHC like molecules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulated cell death in response to microbial infection plays an important role in immune defense and is triggered by pathogen disruption of essential cellular pathways. Gramnegative bacterial pathogens in the Yersinia genus disrupt NF-{kappa}B signaling via translocated effectors injected by a type III secretion system (T3SS), thereby preventing induction of cytokine production and antimicrobial defense. In murine models of infection, Yersinia blockade of NF-{kappa}B signaling triggers cell-extrinsic apoptosis through Receptor Interacting Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1) and caspase-8, which is required for bacterial clearance and host survival. Unexpectedly, we find that human macrophages undergo apoptosis independently of RIPK1 in response to Yersinia or chemical blockade of IKK/{beta}. Instead, IKK blockade led to decreased cFLIP expression, and overexpression of cFLIP contributed to protection from IKK blockade-induced apoptosis in human macrophages. Importantly, IKK blockade also induces RIPK1 kinase-independent apoptosis in human T cells and human pancreatic cells. Altogether, our data indicate that, in contrast to murine cells, blockade of IKK activity in human cells triggers a distinct apoptosis pathway that is independent of RIPK1. These findings have implications for the contribution of RIPK1 to cell death in humans and the efficacy of RIPK1 inhibition in human diseases.</p>
