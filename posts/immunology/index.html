A.; Valdez, R.; Gherasim, C.; Gordon, A.; Liu, L.; Ho, D. D.\nScore: 1143.0, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568730\nCOVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.\nPersistent immune imprinting after XBB.1.5 COVID vaccination in humans\nAuthors: Tortorici, M. A.; Addetia, A.; Seo, A. J.; Brown, J.; Sprouse, K.; Logue, J.; Clarke, E.; Franko, N.; Chu, H.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 244.4, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569129\nImmune imprinting - also known as original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.\nInnate extracellular Hsp70 inflammatory properties are mediated by the interaction of Siglec-E and LOX-1 receptors\nAuthors: Borges, T. J.; Lima, K.; Murshid, A.; Lape, I. T.; Zhao, Y.; Rigo, M. M.; Lang, B. J.; Siddiqui, S. S.; Hui, E.; Riella, L. V.; Bonorino, C.; Calderwood, S. K.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569623\nInnate immune responses to cell damage-associated molecular patterns induce a controlled degree of inflammation, ideally avoiding the promotion of intense unwanted inflammatory adverse events. When released by damaged cells, Hsp70 can stimulate different responses that range from immune activation to immune suppression. The effects of Hsp70 are mediated through innate receptors expressed primarily by myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). The regulatory innate receptors that bind to extracellular mouse Hsp70 (mHsp70) are not fully characterized, and neither are their potential interactions with activating innate receptors. Here, we describe that extracellular mHsp70 interacts with a receptor complex formed by inhibitory Siglec-E and activating LOX-1 on DCs. We also find that this interaction takes place within lipid microdomains, and Siglec-E acts as a negative regulator of LOX-1-mediated innate activation upon mHsp70 or oxidized LDL binding. Thus, HSP70 can both bind to and modulate the interaction of inhibitory and activating innate receptors on the cell surface. These findings add another dimension of regulatory mechanism to how self-molecules contribute to dampening of exacerbated inflammatory responses.\nHeterogeneity in lung macrophage control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is determined by T cells\nAuthors: Lai, R.; Williams, T.; Rakib, T.; Lee, J.; Behar, S. M.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569283\nFollowing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, alveolar macrophages are initially infected but ineffectively restrict bacterial replication. The distribution of M. tuberculosis among different cell types in the lung changes with the onset of T cell immunity when the dominant infected cellular niche shifts from alveolar to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We hypothesize that changes in bacterial distribution among different cell types is driven by differences in T cell recognition of infected cells and their subsequent activation of antimicrobial effector mechanisms. We show that CD4 and CD8 T cells efficiently eliminate M. tuberculosis infection in alveolar macrophages, but they have less impact on suppressing infection in MDM, which may be a bacterial niche. Importantly, CD4 T cell responses enhance MDM recruitment to the lung. Thus, the outcome of infection depends on the interaction between the T cell subset and the infected cell; both contribute to the resolution and persistence of the infection.\nDivergent Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Reprogramming of Monocyte Subpopulations in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\nAuthors: Ferrete-Bonastre, A. G.; Martinez-Gallo, M.; Morante-Palacios, O.; Calvillo, C. L.; Calafell-Segura, J.; Rodriguez-Ubreva, J.; Esteller, M.; Cortes-Hernandez, J.; Ballestar, E.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570725\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammation involving various immune cell types. Monocytes, pivotal in promoting and regulating inflammation in SLE, differentiate from classical monocytes into intermediate monocytes and non-classical monocytes, assuming diverse roles. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of these three monocyte subsets in an SLE cohort. In addition to common DNA methylation and transcriptomic alterations, we identified monocyte subset-specific alterations, especially in DNA methylation, which reflect an impact of SLE on the monocyte differentiation process. SLE classical monocytes exhibited a stronger proinflammatory profile, with an interferon signature and were primed for macrophage differentiation. SLE non-classical monocytes displayed a phenotype related to T cell differentiation regulation, and a Th17-promoting phenotype. Changes in monocyte proportions, DNA methylation and expression occurred in relation to disease activity and involved the STAT1 pathway. Integrating bulk datasets with single-cell RNA-seq data of SLE patients further supported the interferon signature in classical monocytes, associating intermediate and non-classical populations with exacerbated complement activation pathways. Our results indicate a subversion of the epigenome and transcriptome in monocyte differentiation toward non-classical subsets in SLE, impacting function, in relation to disease activity and progression.\nSIRPα controls CD47-dependent platelet clearance in mice and humans\nAuthors: Shoham, M.; Yiu, Y. Y.; Hansen, P.; Subramaniam, A.; Broberg, M.; Gars, E.; Raveh, T.; FinnGen, ; Weissman, I. L.; Sinnott-Armstrong, N.; Krishnan, A.; Ollila, H.; Tal, M. C.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.09.570874\nOver the last decade, more data has revealed that increased surface expression of the \"don't eat me\" CD47 protein on cancer cells plays a role in immune evasion and tumor progression, with CD47 blockade emerging as a new therapy in immuno-oncology. CD47 is critical in regulating cell homeostasis and clearance, as binding of CD47 to the inhibitory receptor SIRP can prevent phagocytosis and macrophage-mediated cell clearance. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the CD47-SIRP signal in platelet homeostasis and clearance. Therapeutic reagents targeting the CD47-SIRP axis are very promising for treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but lead to transient anemia or thrombocytopenia in a subset of patients. We found that platelet homeostatic clearance is regulated through the CD47-SIRP axis and that therapeutic blockade to disrupt this interaction in mice and in humans has a significant impact on platelet levels. Furthermore, we identified genetic variations at the SIRPA locus that impact platelet levels in humans such that higher SIRPA gene expression is associated with higher platelet levels. SIRPA expression at either end of the normal range may affect clinical outcomes of treatment with anti-CD47 therapy.\nFast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 to JN.1 under heavy immune pressure\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Yu, Y.; Xu, Y.; Jian, F.; Song, W.; Yisimayi, A.; Wang, P.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Yu, L.; Niu, X.; Wang, J.; Wang, Y.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Wang, Y.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 326.2, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566860\nWhile the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5+L452R+F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5+L455F+F456L+A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.\nRetroelement-Age Clocks: Epigenetic Age Captured by Human Endogenous Retrovirus and LINE-1 DNA methylation states\nAuthors: Ndhlovu, L.; Bendall, M.; Dwaraka, V. B.; Pang, A. P.; Dopkins, N.; Carreras, N.; Smith, R.; Nixon, D.; Corley, M. J.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570422\nHuman endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), the remnants of ancient viral infections embedded within the human genome, and long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE-1), a class of autonomous retrotransposons, are silenced by host epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. The resurrection of particular retroelements has been linked to biological aging. Whether the DNA methylation states of locus specific HERVs and LINEs can be used as a biomarker of chronological age in humans remains unclear. We show that highly predictive epigenetic clocks of chronological age can be constructed from retroelement DNA methylation states in the immune system, across human tissues, and pan-mammalian species. We found retroelement epigenetic clocks were reversed during transient epigenetic reprogramming, accelerated in people living with HIV-1, responsive to antiretroviral therapy, and accurate in estimating long-term culture ages of human brain organoids. Our findings support the hypothesis of epigenetic dysregulation of retroelements as a potential contributor to the biological hallmarks of aging.\nReplication-attenuated r3LCMV vectors potentiate tumor control via IFN-I\nAuthors: Chung, Y. R.; Awakoaiye, B.; Dangi, T.; Fourati, S.; Penaloza-MacMaster, P.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570847\nViral vectors are being used for the treatment of cancer. Yet their efficacy varies among tumors and their use poses challenges in immunosuppressed patients, underscoring the need for alternatives. We report striking antitumoral effects by a nonlytic viral vector based on attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (r3LCMV). We show in multiple tumor models that injection of tumor-bearing mice with this novel vector results in improved tumor control and survival. Importantly, r3LCMV also improved tumor control in immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice. Single cell RNA-Seq analyses, antibody blockade experiments, and KO models revealed a critical role for host IFN-I in the antitumoral efficacy of r3LCMV vectors. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent antitumoral effects by a replication-attenuated LCMV vector and unveil mechanisms underlying its antitumoral efficacy.\nFluoxetine promotes immunometabolic defenses to mediate host-pathogen cooperation during sepsis\nAuthors: Gallant, R. M.; Snyder, J. M.; Ayres, J. S.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567681\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are some of the most prescribed drugs in the world. While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19, however the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin, and instead increases levels of circulating IL-10. IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia and cardiac triglyceride accumulation, allowing for metabolic reprogramming of the heart. Our work reveals a beneficial \"off-target\" effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune imprinting - also known as  original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Innate immune responses to cell damage-associated molecular patterns induce a controlled degree of inflammation, ideally avoiding the promotion of intense unwanted inflammatory adverse events. When released by damaged cells, Hsp70 can stimulate different responses that range from immune activation to immune suppression. The effects of Hsp70 are mediated through innate receptors expressed primarily by myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). The regulatory innate receptors that bind to extracellular mouse Hsp70 (mHsp70) are not fully characterized, and neither are their potential interactions with activating innate receptors. Here, we describe that extracellular mHsp70 interacts with a receptor complex formed by inhibitory Siglec-E and activating LOX-1 on DCs. We also find that this interaction takes place within lipid microdomains, and Siglec-E acts as a negative regulator of LOX-1-mediated innate activation upon mHsp70 or oxidized LDL binding. Thus, HSP70 can both bind to and modulate the interaction of inhibitory and activating innate receptors on the cell surface. These findings add another dimension of regulatory mechanism to how self-molecules contribute to dampening of exacerbated inflammatory responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, alveolar macrophages are initially infected but ineffectively restrict bacterial replication. The distribution of M. tuberculosis among different cell types in the lung changes with the onset of T cell immunity when the dominant infected cellular niche shifts from alveolar to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We hypothesize that changes in bacterial distribution among different cell types is driven by differences in T cell recognition of infected cells and their subsequent activation of antimicrobial effector mechanisms. We show that CD4 and CD8 T cells efficiently eliminate M. tuberculosis infection in alveolar macrophages, but they have less impact on suppressing infection in MDM, which may be a bacterial niche. Importantly, CD4 T cell responses enhance MDM recruitment to the lung. Thus, the outcome of infection depends on the interaction between the T cell subset and the infected cell; both contribute to the resolution and persistence of the infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammation involving various immune cell types. Monocytes, pivotal in promoting and regulating inflammation in SLE, differentiate from classical monocytes into intermediate monocytes and non-classical monocytes, assuming diverse roles. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles of these three monocyte subsets in an SLE cohort. In addition to common DNA methylation and transcriptomic alterations, we identified monocyte subset-specific alterations, especially in DNA methylation, which reflect an impact of SLE on the monocyte differentiation process. SLE classical monocytes exhibited a stronger proinflammatory profile, with an interferon signature and were primed for macrophage differentiation. SLE non-classical monocytes displayed a phenotype related to T cell differentiation regulation, and a Th17-promoting phenotype. Changes in monocyte proportions, DNA methylation and expression occurred in relation to disease activity and involved the STAT1 pathway. Integrating bulk datasets with single-cell RNA-seq data of SLE patients further supported the interferon signature in classical monocytes, associating intermediate and non-classical populations with exacerbated complement activation pathways. Our results indicate a subversion of the epigenome and transcriptome in monocyte differentiation toward non-classical subsets in SLE, impacting function, in relation to disease activity and progression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the last decade, more data has revealed that increased surface expression of the &#34;don&#39;t eat me&#34; CD47 protein on cancer cells plays a role in immune evasion and tumor progression, with CD47 blockade emerging as a new therapy in immuno-oncology. CD47 is critical in regulating cell homeostasis and clearance, as binding of CD47 to the inhibitory receptor SIRP can prevent phagocytosis and macrophage-mediated cell clearance. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the CD47-SIRP signal in platelet homeostasis and clearance. Therapeutic reagents targeting the CD47-SIRP axis are very promising for treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but lead to transient anemia or thrombocytopenia in a subset of patients. We found that platelet homeostatic clearance is regulated through the CD47-SIRP axis and that therapeutic blockade to disrupt this interaction in mice and in humans has a significant impact on platelet levels. Furthermore, we identified genetic variations at the SIRPA locus that impact platelet levels in humans such that higher SIRPA gene expression is associated with higher platelet levels. SIRPA expression at either end of the normal range may affect clinical outcomes of treatment with anti-CD47 therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L452R&#43;F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L455F&#43;F456L&#43;A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), the remnants of ancient viral infections embedded within the human genome, and long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE-1), a class of autonomous retrotransposons, are silenced by host epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. The resurrection of particular retroelements has been linked to biological aging. Whether the DNA methylation states of locus specific HERVs and LINEs can be used as a biomarker of chronological age in humans remains unclear. We show that highly predictive epigenetic clocks of chronological age can be constructed from retroelement DNA methylation states in the immune system, across human tissues, and pan-mammalian species. We found retroelement epigenetic clocks were reversed during transient epigenetic reprogramming, accelerated in people living with HIV-1, responsive to antiretroviral therapy, and accurate in estimating long-term culture ages of human brain organoids. Our findings support the hypothesis of epigenetic dysregulation of retroelements as a potential contributor to the biological hallmarks of aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viral vectors are being used for the treatment of cancer. Yet their efficacy varies among tumors and their use poses challenges in immunosuppressed patients, underscoring the need for alternatives. We report striking antitumoral effects by a nonlytic viral vector based on attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (r3LCMV). We show in multiple tumor models that injection of tumor-bearing mice with this novel vector results in improved tumor control and survival. Importantly, r3LCMV also improved tumor control in immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice. Single cell RNA-Seq analyses, antibody blockade experiments, and KO models revealed a critical role for host IFN-I in the antitumoral efficacy of r3LCMV vectors. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent antitumoral effects by a replication-attenuated LCMV vector and unveil mechanisms underlying its antitumoral efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are some of the most prescribed drugs in the world. While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19, however the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin, and instead increases levels of circulating IL-10. IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia and cardiac triglyceride accumulation, allowing for metabolic reprogramming of the heart. Our work reveals a beneficial &#34;off-target&#34; effect of fluoxetine, and reveals a protective immunometabolic defense mechanism with therapeutic potential.</p>
