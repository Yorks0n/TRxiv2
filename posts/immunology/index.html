A.; Valdez, R.; Gherasim, C.; Gordon, A.; Liu, L.; Ho, D. D.\nScore: 584.3, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568730\nCOVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-Co-V-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,764-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.\nFast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 to JN.1 under heavy immune pressure\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Yu, Y.; Xu, Y.; Jian, F.; Song, W.; Yisimayi, A.; Wang, P.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Yu, L.; Niu, X.; Wang, J.; Wang, Y.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Wang, Y.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 309.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566860\nWhile the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5+L452R+F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5+L455F+F456L+A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.\nHost-derived oxidized phospholipids initiate effector-triggered immunity fostering lethality upon microbial encounter.\nAuthors: Di Gioia, M.; Poli, V.; Tan, P.; Spreafico, R.; Chou, A.; Cuenca, A.; Gordts, P.; Pandolfi, L.; Meloni, F.; Witztum, J.; Chou, J.; Springstead, J.; Zanoni, I.\nScore: 34.7, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568047\nMacrophages detect invading microorganisms via pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or via sensing the activity of virulence factors that initiates effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Tissue damage that follows pathogen encounter leads to the release of host-derived factors that participate to inflammation. How these self-derived molecules are sensed by macrophages and their impact on immunity remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that, in mice and humans, host-derived oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) are formed upon microbial encounter. oxPL blockade restricts inflammation and prevents the death of the host, without affecting pathogen burden. Mechanistically, oxPLs bind and inhibit AKT, a master regulator of immunity and metabolism. AKT inhibition potentiates the methionine cycle, and epigenetically dampens Il10, a pluripotent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Overall, we found that host-derived inflammatory cues act as \"self\" virulence factors that initiate ETI and that their activity can be targeted to protect the host against excessive inflammation upon microbial encounter.\nAntiviral innate immune memory in alveolar macrophages following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAuthors: Lercher, A.; Cheong, J.-G.; Jiang, C.; Hoffmann, H.-H.; Ashbrook, A. W.; Yin, Y. S.; Quirk, C.; DeGrace, E. J.; Chiriboga, L.; Rosenberg, B. R.; Josefowicz, S. Z.; Rice, C. M.\nScore: 29.1, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568354\nPathogen encounter results in long-lasting epigenetic imprinting that shapes diseases caused by heterologous pathogens. The breadth of this innate immune memory is of particular interest in the context of respiratory pathogens with increased pandemic potential and wide-ranging impact on global health. Here, we investigated epigenetic imprinting across cell lineages in a disease relevant murine model of SARS-CoV-2 recovery. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased chromatin accessibility of type I interferon (IFN-I) related transcription factors in airway-resident macrophages. Mechanistically, establishment of this innate immune memory required viral pattern recognition and canonical IFN-I signaling and augmented secondary antiviral responses. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection ameliorated disease caused by the heterologous respiratory pathogen influenza A virus. Insights into innate immune memory and how it affects subsequent infections with heterologous pathogens to influence disease pathology could facilitate the development of broadly effective therapeutic strategies.\nSARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment followed by vaccination shifts human memory B cell epitope recognition suggesting antibody feedback\nAuthors: Coelho, C. H.; Bloom, N.; Ramirez, S. I.; Parikh, U. M.; Heaps, A.; Sieg, S. F.; Greninger, A.; Ritz, J.; Moser, C.; Eron, J. J.; Currier, J. S.; Klekotka, P.; Wohl, D. A.; Daar, E. S.; Li, J.; Hughes, M. D.; Chew, K. W.; Smith, D. M.; Crotty, S.; Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines: 2/A5401 (ACTIV-2/A5401) Study Team, Score: 22.2, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567575\nTherapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been extensively studied in humans, but the impact on immune memory of mAb treatment during an ongoing immune response has remained unclear. Here, we evaluated the effect of infusion of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mAb bamlanivimab on memory B cells (MBCs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Bamlanivimab treatment skewed the repertoire of memory B cells targeting Spike towards non-RBD epitopes. Furthermore, the relative affinity of RBD memory B cells was weaker in mAb-treated individuals compared to placebo-treated individuals over time. Subsequently, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, memory B cell differences persisted and mapped to a specific defect in recognition of the class II RBD site, the same RBD epitope recognized by bamlanivimab. These findings indicate a substantial role of antibody feedback in regulating human memory B cell responses, both to infection and vaccination. These data indicate that mAb administration can promote alterations in the epitopes recognized by the B cell repertoire, and the single administration of mAb can continue to determine the fate of B cells in response to additional antigen exposures months later. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEvaluating the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection requires a comprehensive understanding of their impact on B cell responses at the cellular level and how these responses are shaped after vaccination. We report for the first time the effect of bamlanivimab on SARS-CoV-2 specific human memory B cells of COVID-19 infected humans receiving, or not, mRNA immunization.\nSpatially resolved single-cell atlas of the lung in fatal Covid19 in an African population reveals a distinct cellular signature and an interferon gamma dominated response\nAuthors: Nyirenda, J.; Hardy, O.; Silva Filho, J.

We used histology and high-dimensional imaging to characterise fatal lung disease in Malawian adults with (n=9) and without (n=7) Covid19, and generated single-cell transcriptomics data from lung, blood and nasal cells. Data integration with other cohorts showed a conserved Covid19 histopathological signature, driven by contrasting immune and inflammatory mechanisms: in the Malawi cohort, by response to interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) in lung-resident alveolar macrophages, in USA, European and Asian cohorts by type I/III interferon responses, particularly in blood-derived monocytes. HIV status had minimal impact on histology or immunopathology. Our study provides data resources and highlights the importance of studying the cellular mechanisms of disease in underrepresented populations, indicating shared and distinct targets for treatment.\nMgl2+ cDC2s coordinate fungal allergic airway type 2, but not type 17, inflammation.\nAuthors: Cook, P. C.; Brown, S. L.; Houlder, E. L.; Baker, S.; Svedberg, F. R.; Howell, G.; Bertuzzi, M.; Boon, L.; Konkel, J. E.; Allen, J. E.; MacDonald, A. S.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568263\nFungal spores are abundant in the environment and a major cause of asthma. Originally characterised as a type 2 inflammatory disease, allergic airway inflammation that underpins asthma can also involve type 17 inflammation, which can exacerbate disease causing failure of treatments tailored to inhibit type 2 factors. However, the mechanisms that determine the host response to fungi, which can trigger both type 2 and type 17 inflammation in allergic airway disease, remain unclear. We found that CD11c+ DCs and CD4+ T cells are essential for development of both type 2 and type 17 airway inflammation in mice when repeatedly exposed to inhaled spores. Single cell RNA-sequencing enabled the development of multi-parameter cytometry that identified allergic inflammation dramatically altered the proportion of numerous DC clusters in the lung, but that only two of these (Mgl2+ cDC2s and CCR7+ DCs) migrated to the dLNs. Targeted removal of several DC subsets revealed that only Mgl2+ cDC2 depletion dramatically reduced type 2, but not type 17, anti-fungal allergic airway inflammation. These data highlight distinct DC subsets are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of pulmonary fungal disease.\nAssessing Age-Related Decline in Anti-Bacterial Immune Responses Using an Ex-vivo Assay in African Turquoise Killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri)\nAuthors: Morabito, G.; Davila Aleman, F. D.; Valenzano, D. R.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568569\nEx-vivo immune functional assays serve as essential tools for uncovering the intricate molecular mechanisms behind immune responses, both intrinsic and extrinsic, across a diverse spectrum of conditions and interventions. In this study, we devised an innovative assay aimed at quantifying anti-bacterial responses in immune cells from the primary immune organ of small teleosts. Our model of choice is the the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), which has emerged as a prominent model system in the field of biology of aging, because of its natural short lifespan and the broad range of aging-related dysfunctions. Using our novel ex vivo assay, we tested age-associated differences in immune cell functionality, measured as anti-bacterial responses in young and aged turquoise killifish. Our results show that the ability to inhibit bacterial growth declines in cells extracted from aged killifish, compared to young killifish. This ex-vivo assay, designed for rapid measures of immune effector responses, holds the potential to be a scalable tool for assessing the cellular and molecular basis for anti-microbial immune responses under a range of interventions.\nDurable immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in both lower and upper airways achieved with a gorilla adenovirus (GRAd) S-2P vaccine in non-human primates\nAuthors: Moliva, J.

To address this challenge, theres a need for vaccines that induce mucosal immunity and can rapidly control the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that a single immunization with a novel gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine (GRAd) carrying the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein (S-2P) in non-human primates provided protective immunity for over one year against the BA.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2. A prime-boost regimen using GRAd followed by adjuvanted S-2P (GRAd+S-2P) accelerated viral clearance in both the lower and upper airways. GRAd delivered via aerosol (GRAd(AE)+S-2P) modestly improved protection compared to its matched intramuscular regimen, but showed dramatically superior boosting by mRNA and, importantly, total virus clearance in the upper airway by day 4 post infection. GrAd vaccination regimens elicited robust and durable systemic and mucosal antibody responses to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, but only GRAd(AE)+S-2P generated long-lasting T cell responses in the lung. This research underscores the flexibility of the GRAd vaccine platform to provide durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in both the lower and upper airways.\nAn Environmental Restriction impairs HIV-1 virion fusion and triggers innate immune recognition\nAuthors: Sid Ahmed, S.; Zimmermann, L.; Imle, A.; Wuebben, K.; Tibroni, N.; Rauch-Wirth, L.; Muench, J.; Chlanda, P.; Graw, F.; Fackler, O. T.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568261\nIn vivo, HIV-1 replicates within 3D tissues, yet the impact of tissue-like environments on viral spread is largely unknown. Our previous research identified that synthetic 3D environments impose an Environmental Restriction to cell-free Virus Infectivity (ERVI) that diminishes HIV-1 particle infectivity. Here, mechanistic studies reveal that ERVI is implemented within minutes, saturable and induced by different adhesive tissue-like 3D matrices. ERVI reduces infectivity across a wide range of primary HIV-1 strains and virions bearing distinct viral glycoproteins but does not damage virion morphology or affect their binding to target cells. Rather, ERVI impairs virion fusion with target cells and infectivity enhancing peptide nanofibrils can restore efficient infection. In addition, ERVI sensitizes HIV-1 particles for recognition by monocyte-derived macrophages via toll-like receptors 4 and 8, triggering pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. These results suggest that ERVI represents a broadly acting, tissue-intrinsic barrier to virus spread that reduces the fusogenicity of cell-free virions and sensitizes them for innate immune recognition.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-Co-V-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,764-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L452R&#43;F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L455F&#43;F456L&#43;A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Macrophages detect invading microorganisms via pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or via sensing the activity of virulence factors that initiates effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Tissue damage that follows pathogen encounter leads to the release of host-derived factors that participate to inflammation. How these self-derived molecules are sensed by macrophages and their impact on immunity remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that, in mice and humans, host-derived oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) are formed upon microbial encounter. oxPL blockade restricts inflammation and prevents the death of the host, without affecting pathogen burden. Mechanistically, oxPLs bind and inhibit AKT, a master regulator of immunity and metabolism. AKT inhibition potentiates the methionine cycle, and epigenetically dampens Il10, a pluripotent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Overall, we found that host-derived inflammatory cues act as &#34;self&#34; virulence factors that initiate ETI and that their activity can be targeted to protect the host against excessive inflammation upon microbial encounter.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogen encounter results in long-lasting epigenetic imprinting that shapes diseases caused by heterologous pathogens. The breadth of this innate immune memory is of particular interest in the context of respiratory pathogens with increased pandemic potential and wide-ranging impact on global health. Here, we investigated epigenetic imprinting across cell lineages in a disease relevant murine model of SARS-CoV-2 recovery. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased chromatin accessibility of type I interferon (IFN-I) related transcription factors in airway-resident macrophages. Mechanistically, establishment of this innate immune memory required viral pattern recognition and canonical IFN-I signaling and augmented secondary antiviral responses. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection ameliorated disease caused by the heterologous respiratory pathogen influenza A virus. Insights into innate immune memory and how it affects subsequent infections with heterologous pathogens to influence disease pathology could facilitate the development of broadly effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been extensively studied in humans, but the impact on immune memory of mAb treatment during an ongoing immune response has remained unclear. Here, we evaluated the effect of infusion of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mAb bamlanivimab on memory B cells (MBCs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Bamlanivimab treatment skewed the repertoire of memory B cells targeting Spike towards non-RBD epitopes. Furthermore, the relative affinity of RBD memory B cells was weaker in mAb-treated individuals compared to placebo-treated individuals over time. Subsequently, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, memory B cell differences persisted and mapped to a specific defect in recognition of the class II RBD site, the same RBD epitope recognized by bamlanivimab. These findings indicate a substantial role of antibody feedback in regulating human memory B cell responses, both to infection and vaccination. These data indicate that mAb administration can promote alterations in the epitopes recognized by the B cell repertoire, and the single administration of mAb can continue to determine the fate of B cells in response to additional antigen exposures months later.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEvaluating the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection requires a comprehensive understanding of their impact on B cell responses at the cellular level and how these responses are shaped after vaccination. We report for the first time the effect of bamlanivimab on SARS-CoV-2 specific human memory B cells of COVID-19 infected humans receiving, or not, mRNA immunization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Postmortem single-cell studies have transformed understanding of lower respiratory tract diseases (LRTD) including Covid19 but there is almost no data from African settings where HIV, malaria and other environmental exposures may affect disease pathobiology and treatment targets. We used histology and high-dimensional imaging to characterise fatal lung disease in Malawian adults with (n=9) and without (n=7) Covid19, and generated single-cell transcriptomics data from lung, blood and nasal cells. Data integration with other cohorts showed a conserved Covid19 histopathological signature, driven by contrasting immune and inflammatory mechanisms: in the Malawi cohort, by response to interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) in lung-resident alveolar macrophages, in USA, European and Asian cohorts by type I/III interferon responses, particularly in blood-derived monocytes. HIV status had minimal impact on histology or immunopathology. Our study provides data resources and highlights the importance of studying the cellular mechanisms of disease in underrepresented populations, indicating shared and distinct targets for treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fungal spores are abundant in the environment and a major cause of asthma. Originally characterised as a type 2 inflammatory disease, allergic airway inflammation that underpins asthma can also involve type 17 inflammation, which can exacerbate disease causing failure of treatments tailored to inhibit type 2 factors. However, the mechanisms that determine the host response to fungi, which can trigger both type 2 and type 17 inflammation in allergic airway disease, remain unclear. We found that CD11c&#43; DCs and CD4&#43; T cells are essential for development of both type 2 and type 17 airway inflammation in mice when repeatedly exposed to inhaled spores. Single cell RNA-sequencing enabled the development of multi-parameter cytometry that identified allergic inflammation dramatically altered the proportion of numerous DC clusters in the lung, but that only two of these (Mgl2&#43; cDC2s and CCR7&#43; DCs) migrated to the dLNs. Targeted removal of several DC subsets revealed that only Mgl2&#43; cDC2 depletion dramatically reduced type 2, but not type 17, anti-fungal allergic airway inflammation. These data highlight distinct DC subsets are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of pulmonary fungal disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ex-vivo immune functional assays serve as essential tools for uncovering the intricate molecular mechanisms behind immune responses, both intrinsic and extrinsic, across a diverse spectrum of conditions and interventions. In this study, we devised an innovative assay aimed at quantifying anti-bacterial responses in immune cells from the primary immune organ of small teleosts. Our model of choice is the the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), which has emerged as a prominent model system in the field of biology of aging, because of its natural short lifespan and the broad range of aging-related dysfunctions. Using our novel ex vivo assay, we tested age-associated differences in immune cell functionality, measured as anti-bacterial responses in young and aged turquoise killifish. Our results show that the ability to inhibit bacterial growth declines in cells extracted from aged killifish, compared to young killifish. This ex-vivo assay, designed for rapid measures of immune effector responses, holds the potential to be a scalable tool for assessing the cellular and molecular basis for anti-microbial immune responses under a range of interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a global threat, and current vaccines, while effective against severe illness, fall short in preventing transmission. To address this challenge, theres a need for vaccines that induce mucosal immunity and can rapidly control the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that a single immunization with a novel gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine (GRAd) carrying the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein (S-2P) in non-human primates provided protective immunity for over one year against the BA.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2. A prime-boost regimen using GRAd followed by adjuvanted S-2P (GRAd&#43;S-2P) accelerated viral clearance in both the lower and upper airways. GRAd delivered via aerosol (GRAd(AE)&#43;S-2P) modestly improved protection compared to its matched intramuscular regimen, but showed dramatically superior boosting by mRNA and, importantly, total virus clearance in the upper airway by day 4 post infection. GrAd vaccination regimens elicited robust and durable systemic and mucosal antibody responses to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, but only GRAd(AE)&#43;S-2P generated long-lasting T cell responses in the lung. This research underscores the flexibility of the GRAd vaccine platform to provide durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in both the lower and upper airways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vivo, HIV-1 replicates within 3D tissues, yet the impact of tissue-like environments on viral spread is largely unknown. Our previous research identified that synthetic 3D environments impose an Environmental Restriction to cell-free Virus Infectivity (ERVI) that diminishes HIV-1 particle infectivity. Here, mechanistic studies reveal that ERVI is implemented within minutes, saturable and induced by different adhesive tissue-like 3D matrices. ERVI reduces infectivity across a wide range of primary HIV-1 strains and virions bearing distinct viral glycoproteins but does not damage virion morphology or affect their binding to target cells. Rather, ERVI impairs virion fusion with target cells and infectivity enhancing peptide nanofibrils can restore efficient infection. In addition, ERVI sensitizes HIV-1 particles for recognition by monocyte-derived macrophages via toll-like receptors 4 and 8, triggering pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. These results suggest that ERVI represents a broadly acting, tissue-intrinsic barrier to virus spread that reduces the fusogenicity of cell-free virions and sensitizes them for innate immune recognition.</p>
