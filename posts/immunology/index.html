Understanding how infection and vaccination induce mucosal immune responses and how they fluctuate over time is important, especially since they are key in preventing infection and reducing disease severity. We established a novel methodology for assessing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine and antibody responses at the nasal epithelium by using nasopharyngeal swabs collected longitudinally before and after either SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We then compared responses between mucosal and systemic compartments. We demonstrate that cytokine and antibody profiles differ markedly between compartments. Nasal cytokines show a wound healing phenotype while plasma cytokines are consistent with pro-inflammatory pathways. We found that nasal IgA and IgG have different kinetics after infection, with IgA peaking first. Although vaccination results in low nasal IgA, IgG induction persists for up to 180 days post-vaccination. This research highlights the importance of studying mucosal responses in addition to systemic responses to respiratory infections to understand the correlates of disease severity and immune memory. The methods described herein can be used to further mucosal vaccine development by giving us a better understanding of immunity at the nasal epithelium providing a simpler, alternative clinical practice to studying mucosal responses to infection. TeaserA nasopharyngeal swab can be used to study the intranasal immune response and yields much more information than a simple viral diagnosis.\nProtective intravenous BCG vaccination induces enhanced immune signaling in the airways\nAuthors: Peters, J. M.; Irvine, E. B.; Rosenberg, J. M.; Wadsworth, M. H.; Hughes, T. K.; Sutton, M.; Nyquist, S. K.; Bromley, J. D.; Mondal, R.; Roederer, M.; Seder, R.; Darrah, P. A.; Flynn, J. L.; Shalek, A. K.; Fortune, S. M.; Bryson, B. D.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549208\nIntradermal (ID) Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most widely administered vaccine in the world. However, ID-BCG fails to achieve the level of protection needed in adults to alter the course of the tuberculosis epidemic. Recent studies in non-human primates have demonstrated high levels of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) following intravenous (IV) administration of BCG. However, the protective immune features that emerge following IV BCG vaccination remain incompletely defined. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) to transcriptionally profile 157,114 unstimulated and purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 29 rhesus macaques immunized with BCG across routes of administration and doses to uncover cell composition-, gene expression-, and biological network-level signatures associated with IV BCG-mediated protection. Our analyses revealed that high-dose IV BCG drove an influx of polyfunctional T cells and macrophages into the airways. These macrophages exhibited a basal activation phenotype even in the absence of PPD-stimulation, defined in part by IFN and TNF- signaling up to 6 months following BCG immunization. Furthermore, intercellular immune signaling pathways between key myeloid and T cell subsets were enhanced following PPD-stimulation in high-dose IV BCG-vaccinated macaques. High-dose IV BCG also engendered quantitatively and qualitatively stronger transcriptional responses to PPD-stimulation, with a robust Th1-Th17 transcriptional phenotype in T cells, and augmented transcriptional signatures of reactive oxygen species production, hypoxia, and IFN-{gamma} response within alveolar macrophages. Collectively, this work supports that IV BCG immunization creates a unique cellular ecosystem in the airways, which primes and enables local myeloid cells to effectively clear Mtb upon challenge.\nNGFR regulates germinal center B-cell activation and negative selection\nAuthors: Hernandez-Barranco, A.; S. Mazariegos, M.; Santos, V.; Caleiras, E.; Nogues, L.; Mourcin, F.; Leonard, S.; Oblet, C.; Genebrier, S.; Rossille, D.; Benguria, A.; Vazquez, E.; Dopazo, A.; Efeyan, A.; Ortega-Molina, A.; Cogne, M.; Tarte, K.; Peinado, H.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548960\nThe expression of the Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) has been described in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), the major lymphoid stromal cell (LSC) compartment regulating B-cell activation within germinal centers (GCs). However, the role of NGFR in humoral response is not well defined. In this work, we have studied the effect of Ngfr KO in LNs organization and function. Ngfr KO led to spontaneous GC formation and expansion of GC B-cell compartment which were related to Ngfr depletion in non-hematopoietic radioresistant compartment. In agreement, Ngfr KO mice showed alterations in LSC with an increased frequency of FDCs harboring an activated phenotype characterized by the overexpression of CD21/35, MAdCAM-1, and VCAM-1. Moreover, Ngfr KO mice showed GC ectopic location, loss of polarization, impaired high-affinity antibody production, and increased circulating autoantibodies. In addition, Ngfr KO/Bcl2 Tg mice displayed increased levels of autoantibodies, higher incidence of autoimmunity, and decreased overall survival. Our work shows that NGFR maintains GC structure and functionality, being involved in the regulation of antibody production and immune tolerance.\nPre-existing interferon gamma conditions the lung to mediate early control of SARS-CoV-2\nAuthors: Hilligan, K. L.; Namasivayam, S.; Clancy, C. S.; Baker, P. J.; Old, S. I.; Peluf, V.; Amaral, E. P.; Oland, S. D.; O'Mard, D.; Laux, J.; Cohen, M.; Garza, N. L.; Lafont, B.; Johnson, R. F.; Feng, C. G.; Jankovic, D.; Lamiable, O.; Mayer-Barber, K. D.; Sher, A.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549135\nInterferons (IFNs) are critical for anti-viral host defence. Type-1 and type-3 IFNs are typically associated with early control of viral replication and promotion of inflammatory immune responses; however, less is known about the role of IFN{gamma} in anti-viral immunity, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We have previously observed that lung infection with attenuated bacteria Mycobacterium bovis BCG achieved though intravenous (iv) administration provides strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) infection and disease in two mouse models. Assessment of the pulmonary cytokine milieu revealed that iv BCG induces a robust IFN{gamma} response and low levels of IFN{beta}. Here we examined the role of ongoing IFN{gamma} responses due to pre-established bacterial infection on SCV2 disease outcomes in two murine models. We report that IFN{gamma} is required for iv BCG induced reduction in pulmonary viral loads and that this outcome is dependent on IFN{gamma} receptor expression by non-hematopoietic cells. Further analysis revealed that BCG infection promotes the upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with reported anti-viral activity by pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in an IFN{gamma}-dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed protection. Finally, we confirmed the importance of IFN{gamma} in these anti-viral effects by demonstrating that the recombinant cytokine itself provides strong protection against SCV2 challenge when administered intranasally. Together, our data show that a pre-established IFN{gamma} response within the lung is protective against SCV2 infection, suggesting that concurrent or recent infections that drive IFN{gamma} may limit the pathogenesis of SCV2 and supporting possible prophylactic uses of IFN{gamma} in COVID-19 management.\nCLIPB4 is a central node in the protease network that regulates humoral immunity in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Zhang, S.; Kuang, J.; Sellens, K. A.; Morejon, B.; Saab, S. A.; Metto, E. M.; Li, M.; Osta, M.; An, C.; Culbertson, C. T.; Scoglio, C. M.; Michel, K.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.545904\nInsect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.\nInsight into the structural hierarchy of the protease cascade that regulates the mosquito melanization response\nAuthors: Saab, S. A.; Zhang, X.; Morejon, B.; Michel, K.; Osta, M. A.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548954\nSerine protease cascades regulate important physiological processes during infection, from complement activation and coagulation in mammals to melanization and Toll pathway activation in insects. Key components of these cascades in insects are clip domain serine proteases (CLIPs) including the catalytic, clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and the non-catalytic, clip domain serine protease homologs (cSPHs), both of which are essential for the proper functioning of these cascades. In the context of the melanization immune response of insects, CLIPs cascades converge on the activation cleavage of the zymogen prophenoloxidase to active phenoloxidase that initiates melanin biogenesis on microbial surfaces. While we have previously provided insight into the structural hierarchy of cSPHs in these cascades in the mosquito vector of malaria Anopheles gambiae, the hierarchy of cSPs as well as their functional interactions with cSPHs remain largely unknown. Here, we define partially the structural hierarchy of An. gambiae cSPs of the CLIPB family that are key factors in the melanization response and characterize their relative contributions to the anti-bacterial melanization response and to mosquito susceptibility to bacterial infections. Based on in vivo and in vitro assays that gauge the activation cleavage profiles of candidate CLIPs, we also propose that bidirectional interactions between cSPs and cSPHs regulate signal amplification and propagation in these cascades.\nHigh-dimensional spectral cytometry panels for whole blood immune phenotyping\nAuthors: Dott, T.; Culina, S.; Chemali, R.; Ait Mansour, C.; Dubois, F.; Jagla, B.; Doisne, J. M.; Rogge, L.; Huetz, F.; Jönsson, F.; Commere, P.-H.; Di Santo, J.; Terrier, B.; Quintana-Murci, L.; Duffy, D.; Hasan, M.; Milieu Interieur Consortium, Score: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549272\nThe need to understand the mechanisms and pathways of immune responses in pathogenic conditions such as cancer and autoimmunity requires awareness of natural immune variability in healthy subjects. To this end, various systems immunology studies have been established. Among them, the Milieu Interieur (MI) study was established to define the boundaries of a healthy immune response and identify determinants of immune response variation. MI used immunophenotyping of a 1000 healthy donor cohort by flow cytometry as a principal outcome for immune variance at steady state. For the 10-year longitudinal MI study, we have developed two high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panels that allow deep characterization of innate and adaptive whole blood immune cells (35 and 34 fluorescent markers, respectively) and standardized the protocol for sample handling, staining, acquisition, and data analysis. This permits the reproducible quantification of over 182 immune cell phenotypes through robust immunophenotyping at a single site. This highly standardized protocol was applied to samples from patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. It is currently used for characterization of the impact of age and environmental factors on peripheral blood immune phenotypes of \u003e400 donors from the initial MI cohort.\nPhytohemagglutinin-Activated CAR-T Cells: Prolonged Persistence and Enhanced Anti-Tumor Response in CD19-Specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nAuthors: Sert, B.; Gulden, G.; Teymur, T.; Ay, Y.; Turan, R. D.; Unaldi, O. M.; Guzenge, E.; Erdil, H. E.; Isik, S.; Oz, P.; Bozkurt, I.; Arpaci, T.; Kamali, O.; Ovali, E.; Tarhan, N.; Tastan, C.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.547808\nIn recent times, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown rapid advancements and gained clinical approval for use in cancer immunotherapy. CAR, a synthetic receptor integrated into autologous T cells, has yielded highly successful results in patients with leukemia. The significant potential of CAR-T cells has been validated through clinical trials in adult and pediatric cancer treatments. Our therapy developed specifically for CD19-specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo tests. To enhance the response against cancer, provide a bistimulatory effect, and increase stability, we designed two different CAR structures specific to CD19. These designs incorporate the CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains. Through in vitro analysis, we evaluated the population ratios and cytotoxic activities of Central Memory T cells (TCM) and Stem Cell Memory T cells (TSCM) in CAR-T (CAR1928-T and CAR19BB-T) cells. Our initial design, CAR1928-T, produced an effective anti-tumor response. With our second design, CAR19BB-T, we not only achieved an anti-tumor effect but also conferred memory capabilities, leading to a comprehensive treatment approach. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells produced using Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exhibited increased persistence in vitro and in vivo compared to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. The use of PHA to activate CAR19BB-T cells developed a long-lasting and effective CAR-T cell production method in vivo using cancerous animal models. CAR-T cell-treated mice survived tumor-free for up to 60 days, surpassing the survival of mice that received tumors only. Additionally, CAR19BB-T cell production with PHA remained stable over time. These results highlight a novel CAR-T cell production approach with a high-memory T cell profile capable of delaying or preventing cancer relapse. We optimized the method for the production of long-term and effective CAR-T cells and tested it in preclinical experiments. As a result, it was demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated with PHA, when administered as a co-stimulatory dose, can provide continuous proliferation and long-term persistence without compromising their anti-cancer efficacy. Preclinical studies have been completed to obtain valuable data for enhancing the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials and transitioning to clinical applications.\nMegakaryocyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated IgG antibodies in mice\nAuthors: Mabrouk, M.; Jalali, F.; Zaid, N.; Naya, A.; Khyatti, M.; Khalki, L.; Guessous, F.; Zaid, Y.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549113\nDespite more than 90% of total plasma fucosylated IgG, specific IgGs with low core fucosylation are found sporadically in response to enveloped virus infections and to alloantigens on blood cells. IgG responses with low core fucosylation are directly pathogenic in SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections. In COVID-19, formation of IgG with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgG) against spike protein (S) predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. Low fucosylation of IgG causes increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of platelets, monocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. The mechanism of afucosylated IgG formation has remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue infection, and other disorders. This study demonstrates that infection of megakaryocytes by SARS-CoV-2 drives the formation of pathogenic anti-S afucosylated IgGs, causing pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in Fc{gamma}-expressing mice.\nCARs are organized in nanodomains in the plasma membrane of T cells that accumulate at tumor contact sites\nAuthors: Verbruggen, C.; Gehrke, L.; Banholzer, N.; Ghosh, A.; Reinhard, S.; Weber, J.; Doose, S.; Einsele, H.; Hudecek, M.; Nerreter, T.; Sauer, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549702\nChimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic immune receptors that are expressed in T cells through genetic engineering. CAR-T cells have been successfully used to eradicate very advanced leukemias and lymphomas and their functional properties have been intensively studied. However, relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal expression and organization of CARs on the T-cell membrane and how this influences their efficacy. Here, we applied super-resolution microscopy to visualize CD19-, ROR1-, and ROR2-specific CARs in human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were engineered with lentiviral and transposon-mediated gene transfer. Our data show that the majority of CARs is organized in nanodomains virtually independent of the T cell type, CAR construct and expression level. Quantitative analyses revealed a slightly higher CAR density in transposon-engineered T cells correlating with higher antigen sensitivity and faster resolution of anti-tumor functions compared to lentivirally-engineered T cells. Live-cell fluorescence imaging revealed that both, CAR nanodomains and CAR monomers accumulate at tumor contact sites and form multifocal immunological synapses. Our study provides novel insights into the membrane organization of CARs with single-molecule resolution and illustrates the potential of advanced microscopy to inform the rational design of synthetic immune receptors for applications in immune cell therapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of infections worldwide since its emergence in 2019. Understanding how infection and vaccination induce mucosal immune responses and how they fluctuate over time is important, especially since they are key in preventing infection and reducing disease severity. We established a novel methodology for assessing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine and antibody responses at the nasal epithelium by using nasopharyngeal swabs collected longitudinally before and after either SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We then compared responses between mucosal and systemic compartments. We demonstrate that cytokine and antibody profiles differ markedly between compartments. Nasal cytokines show a wound healing phenotype while plasma cytokines are consistent with pro-inflammatory pathways. We found that nasal IgA and IgG have different kinetics after infection, with IgA peaking first. Although vaccination results in low nasal IgA, IgG induction persists for up to 180 days post-vaccination. This research highlights the importance of studying mucosal responses in addition to systemic responses to respiratory infections to understand the correlates of disease severity and immune memory. The methods described herein can be used to further mucosal vaccine development by giving us a better understanding of immunity at the nasal epithelium providing a simpler, alternative clinical practice to studying mucosal responses to infection.

TeaserA nasopharyngeal swab can be used to study the intranasal immune response and yields much more information than a simple viral diagnosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intradermal (ID) Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most widely administered vaccine in the world. However, ID-BCG fails to achieve the level of protection needed in adults to alter the course of the tuberculosis epidemic. Recent studies in non-human primates have demonstrated high levels of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) following intravenous (IV) administration of BCG. However, the protective immune features that emerge following IV BCG vaccination remain incompletely defined. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) to transcriptionally profile 157,114 unstimulated and purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 29 rhesus macaques immunized with BCG across routes of administration and doses to uncover cell composition-, gene expression-, and biological network-level signatures associated with IV BCG-mediated protection. Our analyses revealed that high-dose IV BCG drove an influx of polyfunctional T cells and macrophages into the airways. These macrophages exhibited a basal activation phenotype even in the absence of PPD-stimulation, defined in part by IFN and TNF- signaling up to 6 months following BCG immunization. Furthermore, intercellular immune signaling pathways between key myeloid and T cell subsets were enhanced following PPD-stimulation in high-dose IV BCG-vaccinated macaques. High-dose IV BCG also engendered quantitatively and qualitatively stronger transcriptional responses to PPD-stimulation, with a robust Th1-Th17 transcriptional phenotype in T cells, and augmented transcriptional signatures of reactive oxygen species production, hypoxia, and IFN-{gamma} response within alveolar macrophages. Collectively, this work supports that IV BCG immunization creates a unique cellular ecosystem in the airways, which primes and enables local myeloid cells to effectively clear Mtb upon challenge.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The expression of the Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) has been described in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), the major lymphoid stromal cell (LSC) compartment regulating B-cell activation within germinal centers (GCs). However, the role of NGFR in humoral response is not well defined. In this work, we have studied the effect of Ngfr KO in LNs organization and function. Ngfr KO led to spontaneous GC formation and expansion of GC B-cell compartment which were related to Ngfr depletion in non-hematopoietic radioresistant compartment. In agreement, Ngfr KO mice showed alterations in LSC with an increased frequency of FDCs harboring an activated phenotype characterized by the overexpression of CD21/35, MAdCAM-1, and VCAM-1. Moreover, Ngfr KO mice showed GC ectopic location, loss of polarization, impaired high-affinity antibody production, and increased circulating autoantibodies. In addition, Ngfr KO/Bcl2 Tg mice displayed increased levels of autoantibodies, higher incidence of autoimmunity, and decreased overall survival. Our work shows that NGFR maintains GC structure and functionality, being involved in the regulation of antibody production and immune tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interferons (IFNs) are critical for anti-viral host defence. Type-1 and type-3 IFNs are typically associated with early control of viral replication and promotion of inflammatory immune responses; however, less is known about the role of IFN{gamma} in anti-viral immunity, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We have previously observed that lung infection with attenuated bacteria Mycobacterium bovis BCG achieved though intravenous (iv) administration provides strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) infection and disease in two mouse models. Assessment of the pulmonary cytokine milieu revealed that iv BCG induces a robust IFN{gamma} response and low levels of IFN{beta}. Here we examined the role of ongoing IFN{gamma} responses due to pre-established bacterial infection on SCV2 disease outcomes in two murine models. We report that IFN{gamma} is required for iv BCG induced reduction in pulmonary viral loads and that this outcome is dependent on IFN{gamma} receptor expression by non-hematopoietic cells. Further analysis revealed that BCG infection promotes the upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with reported anti-viral activity by pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in an IFN{gamma}-dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed protection. Finally, we confirmed the importance of IFN{gamma} in these anti-viral effects by demonstrating that the recombinant cytokine itself provides strong protection against SCV2 challenge when administered intranasally. Together, our data show that a pre-established IFN{gamma} response within the lung is protective against SCV2 infection, suggesting that concurrent or recent infections that drive IFN{gamma} may limit the pathogenesis of SCV2 and supporting possible prophylactic uses of IFN{gamma} in COVID-19 management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Serine protease cascades regulate important physiological processes during infection, from complement activation and coagulation in mammals to melanization and Toll pathway activation in insects. Key components of these cascades in insects are clip domain serine proteases (CLIPs) including the catalytic, clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and the non-catalytic, clip domain serine protease homologs (cSPHs), both of which are essential for the proper functioning of these cascades. In the context of the melanization immune response of insects, CLIPs cascades converge on the activation cleavage of the zymogen prophenoloxidase to active phenoloxidase that initiates melanin biogenesis on microbial surfaces. While we have previously provided insight into the structural hierarchy of cSPHs in these cascades in the mosquito vector of malaria Anopheles gambiae, the hierarchy of cSPs as well as their functional interactions with cSPHs remain largely unknown. Here, we define partially the structural hierarchy of An. gambiae cSPs of the CLIPB family that are key factors in the melanization response and characterize their relative contributions to the anti-bacterial melanization response and to mosquito susceptibility to bacterial infections. Based on in vivo and in vitro assays that gauge the activation cleavage profiles of candidate CLIPs, we also propose that bidirectional interactions between cSPs and cSPHs regulate signal amplification and propagation in these cascades.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The need to understand the mechanisms and pathways of immune responses in pathogenic conditions such as cancer and autoimmunity requires awareness of natural immune variability in healthy subjects. To this end, various systems immunology studies have been established. Among them, the Milieu Interieur (MI) study was established to define the boundaries of a healthy immune response and identify determinants of immune response variation. MI used immunophenotyping of a 1000 healthy donor cohort by flow cytometry as a principal outcome for immune variance at steady state. For the 10-year longitudinal MI study, we have developed two high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panels that allow deep characterization of innate and adaptive whole blood immune cells (35 and 34 fluorescent markers, respectively) and standardized the protocol for sample handling, staining, acquisition, and data analysis. This permits the reproducible quantification of over 182 immune cell phenotypes through robust immunophenotyping at a single site. This highly standardized protocol was applied to samples from patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. It is currently used for characterization of the impact of age and environmental factors on peripheral blood immune phenotypes of &gt;400 donors from the initial MI cohort.</p>

CAR, a synthetic receptor integrated into autologous T cells, has yielded highly successful results in patients with leukemia. The significant potential of CAR-T cells has been validated through clinical trials in adult and pediatric cancer treatments. Our therapy developed specifically for CD19-specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo tests. To enhance the response against cancer, provide a bistimulatory effect, and increase stability, we designed two different CAR structures specific to CD19. These designs incorporate the CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains. Through in vitro analysis, we evaluated the population ratios and cytotoxic activities of Central Memory T cells (TCM) and Stem Cell Memory T cells (TSCM) in CAR-T (CAR1928-T and CAR19BB-T) cells. Our initial design, CAR1928-T, produced an effective anti-tumor response. With our second design, CAR19BB-T, we not only achieved an anti-tumor effect but also conferred memory capabilities, leading to a comprehensive treatment approach. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells produced using Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exhibited increased persistence in vitro and in vivo compared to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. The use of PHA to activate CAR19BB-T cells developed a long-lasting and effective CAR-T cell production method in vivo using cancerous animal models. CAR-T cell-treated mice survived tumor-free for up to 60 days, surpassing the survival of mice that received tumors only. Additionally, CAR19BB-T cell production with PHA remained stable over time. These results highlight a novel CAR-T cell production approach with a high-memory T cell profile capable of delaying or preventing cancer relapse. We optimized the method for the production of long-term and effective CAR-T cells and tested it in preclinical experiments. As a result, it was demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated with PHA, when administered as a co-stimulatory dose, can provide continuous proliferation and long-term persistence without compromising their anti-cancer efficacy. Preclinical studies have been completed to obtain valuable data for enhancing the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials and transitioning to clinical applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite more than 90% of total plasma fucosylated IgG, specific IgGs with low core fucosylation are found sporadically in response to enveloped virus infections and to alloantigens on blood cells. IgG responses with low core fucosylation are directly pathogenic in SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections. In COVID-19, formation of IgG with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgG) against spike protein (S) predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. Low fucosylation of IgG causes increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of platelets, monocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. The mechanism of afucosylated IgG formation has remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue infection, and other disorders. This study demonstrates that infection of megakaryocytes by SARS-CoV-2 drives the formation of pathogenic anti-S afucosylated IgGs, causing pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in Fc{gamma}-expressing mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic immune receptors that are expressed in T cells through genetic engineering. CAR-T cells have been successfully used to eradicate very advanced leukemias and lymphomas and their functional properties have been intensively studied. However, relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal expression and organization of CARs on the T-cell membrane and how this influences their efficacy. Here, we applied super-resolution microscopy to visualize CD19-, ROR1-, and ROR2-specific CARs in human CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells that were engineered with lentiviral and transposon-mediated gene transfer. Our data show that the majority of CARs is organized in nanodomains virtually independent of the T cell type, CAR construct and expression level. Quantitative analyses revealed a slightly higher CAR density in transposon-engineered T cells correlating with higher antigen sensitivity and faster resolution of anti-tumor functions compared to lentivirally-engineered T cells. Live-cell fluorescence imaging revealed that both, CAR nanodomains and CAR monomers accumulate at tumor contact sites and form multifocal immunological synapses. Our study provides novel insights into the membrane organization of CARs with single-molecule resolution and illustrates the potential of advanced microscopy to inform the rational design of synthetic immune receptors for applications in immune cell therapy.</p>
