Recent studies have identified Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.\nMucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination and breakthrough infection\nAuthors: Bhavsar, D.; Singh, G.; Sano, K.; Gleason, C.; Srivastava, K.; Carreno, J. M.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.\nScore: 29.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554732\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have saved millions of lives. However, variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged causing large numbers of breakthrough infections. These developments necessitated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. It has been reported that mucosal antibody levels in the upper respiratory tract, especially for secretory IgA (sIgA), correlate with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still unclear how high levels of mucosal antibodies can be induced. In this study, we measured serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA responses in individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccinations or who experienced breakthrough infections. We found that mRNA booster doses could induce robust serum and saliva IgG responses, especially in individuals who had not experienced infections before, but saliva sIgA responses were weak. In contrast, breakthrough infections in individuals who had received the primary mRNA vaccination series induced robust serum and saliva IgG as well as saliva sIgA responses. Individuals who had received a booster dose and then had a breakthrough infection showed low IgG induction in serum and saliva but still responded with robust saliva sIgA induction. These data suggest that upper respiratory tract exposure to antigen is an efficient way of inducing mucosal sIgA while exposure via intramuscular injection is not.\nDesign of Cytotoxic T Cell Epitopes by Machine Learning of Human Degrons\nAuthors: Truex, N. L.; Mohapatra, S.; Melo, M.; Rodriguez, J.; Li, N.; Abraham, W.; Sementa, D.; Touti, F.; Keskin, D. B.; Wu, C. J.; Irvine, D. J.; Gomez-Bombarelli, R.; Pentelute, B. L.\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554289\nAntigen processing is critical for producing epitope peptides that are presented by HLA molecules for T cell recognition. Therapeutic vaccines aim to harness these epitopes for priming cytotoxic T cell responses against cancer and pathogens, but insufficient processing often reduces vaccine efficacy through limiting the quantity of epitopes released. Here, we set out to improve antigen processing by harnessing protein degradation signals called degrons from the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We used machine learning to generate a computational model that ascribes a proteasomal degradation score between 0 and 100. Epitope peptides with varying degron activities were synthesized and translocated into cells using nontoxic anthrax proteins: protective antigen (PA) and the N-terminus of lethal factor (LFN). Immunogenicity studies revealed epitope sequences with a low score (\u003c25) show pronounced T-cell activation but epitope sequences with a higher score (\u003e75) provide limited activation. This work sheds light on the sequence-activity relationships between proteasomal degradation and epitope immunogenicity, through conserving the epitope region but varying the flanking sequence. We anticipate that future efforts to incorporate proteasomal degradation signals into vaccine designs will lead to enhanced cytotoxic T cell priming by vaccine therapeutics in clinical settings.\nSARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 is a viral RHIM protein promoting cell death linked to Z-RNA sensing and ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling\nAuthors: Mishra, S.; Jain, D.; Dey, A. A.; Nagaraja, S.; Srivastava, M.; Khatun, O.; Balamurugan, K.; Anand, M.; Tripathi, S.; Ganji, M.; Kesavardhana, S.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554434\nInterferons and regulated cell death pathways counteract virus spread and mount immune responses, but their deregulation often results in inflammatory pathologies. The RIP-homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) is a conserved protein domain critical for assembling higher-order amyloid-like signaling complexes inducing cell death. A few DNA viruses employ viral RHIMs mimicking host RHIMs to alleviate cell death-mediated antiviral defenses. Whether RNA viruses operate such viral RHIMs remains unknown. Host RHIM-protein signaling promotes lung damage and cytokine storm in respiratory RNA virus infections, arguing the presence of viral RHIMs in RNA viruses. Here, we report the identification of novel viral RHIMs in Nsp13 and Nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2 and other bat RNA viruses and provide a basis for bats as the hosts for the evolution of RHIMs in RNA viruses. Nsp13 expression promoted CoV-RHIM-1-dependent cell death after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its RNA-binding channel conformation was critical for cell death function. Nsp13 interacted and promoted the formation of large insoluble complexes of ZBP1 and RIPK3. Unlike DNA virus RHIMs, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 did not restrict host RHIM-dependent cell death. Instead, it promoted ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling-mediated cell death dependent on intracellular RNA ligands. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments showed high Z-RNA forming propensity which bound to Z-RNA sensing Z domains and promoted Nsp13-dependent cell death. Our findings reveal the functional viral RHIMs in RNA viruses and the role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 in cell death associated with Z-RNAs and ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling, allowing the understanding of mechanisms of cellular damage and cytokine storm in respiratory virus infections and COVID-19.\nSphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 inhibition induces a pro-apoptotic signaling cascade in T cells\nAuthors: Dixit, D.; Hallisey, V. M.; Zhu, E. Y. S.; Okuniewska, M.; Cadwell, K.; Chipuk, J. E.; Axelrad, J.; Schwab, S. R.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554104\nEffective immunity requires a large, diverse naive T cell repertoire circulating among lymphoid organs in search of antigen. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1PR1 contribute by both directing T cell migration and supporting T cell survival. Here, we address how S1P enables T cell survival, and the implications for patients treated with S1PR1 antagonists. Contrary to expectations, we found that S1PR1 limits apoptosis by maintaining the appropriate balance of BCL2 family members via restraint of JNK activity. Interestingly, the same residues of S1PR1 that enable receptor internalization are required to prevent this pro-apoptotic cascade. Findings in mice were recapitulated in ulcerative colitis patients treated with the S1PR1 antagonist ozanimod, and the loss of naive T cells limited B cell responses. Our findings highlight an unexpected effect of S1PR1 antagonists on the ability to mount immune responses within lymph nodes, beyond their effect on lymph node egress, and suggest both limitations and novel uses of this important class of drugs.\nCell therapy with IL-10-producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells suppresses Graft-versus-Host disease\nAuthors: Reid, K.

B.; Zhang, L.; Novitzky-Basso, I.; Mattsson, J.; Crome, S. Q.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554158\nIL-10 producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC210) have immunoregulatory functions, and limit harmful immune responses across various tissues. Despite their crucial roles in maintaining immune homeostasis, the cell therapy potential of human ILC210 has not been demonstrated, due to both limited numbers in human peripheral blood and lack of definitive markers for identification. Here, we isolate and expand circulating human ILC210, and assess their cell therapy potential in a humanized model of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Cell therapy with human ILC210 decreased GVHD severity and prolonged survival of NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}null (NSG) mice. Adoptive transfer of ILC210 inhibited pathogenic T cell proliferation and intestinal infiltration, and suppressed CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ Tc1 cells in an IL-4 and IL-10 dependent manner. Critically, increased proportions of ILC2s did not correlate with higher rates of cancer relapse in HSCT recipients, and adoptive transfer of ILC210 did not compromise graft-versus-leukemic (GVL) effects in a humanized model. Finally, we identify CD49d and CD86 as novel markers that discriminate ILC210 from conventional ILC2s. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing ILC210 in cell therapies for GVHD and other immune-driven pathologies.\nAI-based antibody discovery platform identifies novel, diverse and pharmacologically active therapeutic antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains\nAuthors: Moldovan Loomis, C.; Lahlali, T.; Van Citters, D.; Sprague, M.; Neveu, G.; Somody, L.; Siska, C. C.; Deming, D.; Asakawa, A. J.; Amimeur, T.; Shaver, J. M.; Carbonelle, C.; Ketchem, R. R.; Alam, A.; Clark, R. H.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554197\nA critical aspect of a successful pandemic response is expedient antibody discovery, manufacturing and deployment of effective lifesaving treatments to patients around the world. However, typical drug discovery and development is a lengthy multi-step process that must align drug efficacy with multiple developability criteria and can take years to complete. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI), and especially machine learning (ML), have great potential to accelerate and improve the optimization of therapeutics, increasing their activity and safety as well as decreasing their development time and manufacturing costs. Here we present a novel, cost-effective and accelerated approach to therapeutic antibody discovery, that couples AI-designed human antibody libraries, biased for improved developability attributes with high throughput and sensitive screening technologies. The applicability of our platform for effective therapeutic antibody discovery is demonstrated here with the identification of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies that are novel, diverse and pharmacologically active. These first-generation antibodies, without the need for affinity maturation, bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with therapeutically-relevant specificity and affinity and display neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity across multiple strains. Altogether, this platform is well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response. IMPORTANCEExpedient discovery and manufacturing of lifesaving therapeutics is critical for pandemic response. The recent COVID pandemic has highlighted the current inefficiencies and the need for improvements. To this end, we present our therapeutic antibody discovery platform that couples artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative high throughput technologies, and we demonstrate its applicability to rapid response. This platform enabled the isolation, characterization, and rapid identification of effective broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with good developability attributes, anticipated to fit our current process development and manufacturing platform. As such, this would benefit cost-of-goods and improve therapeutic access to patients. The AI-derived antibodies represent an advantageous therapeutic modality that can be developed and deployed fast, thus well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response.\nCD163 and Tim-4 identify resident intestinal macrophages across sub-tissular regions that are spatially regulated by TGF-β\nAuthors: Prise, I. E.; Jayaraman, V.; Kästele, V.; Daw, R. H.; Wemyss, K.; Bridgeman, H.; Tamburrano, S.; Strangward, P.; Chew, C.; Martens, L.; Scott, C. L.; Guilliams, M.; Adamson, A. D.; Konkel, J. E.; Shaw, T. N.; Grainger, J. R.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553672\nIn bodily organs, macrophages are localised in poorly understood tissular and sub-tissular niches associated with defined macrophage ontogeny and activity. In the intestine, a paradigm is emerging that long-lived macrophages are dominantly present in the muscular layer, while highly monocyte-replenished populations are found in the lamina propria beneath the epithelial barrier. Whether longevity is restricted in such a simplified manner has not been well explored. Moreover, the impact of specific gut-associated factors on long-lived macrophage functionality and niche occupancy is unknown. We generated sc-RNA-Seq data from wild-type and Ccr2-/- mice to identify phenotypic features of long-lived macrophage populations in distinct intestinal niches and identified CD163 as a useful marker to distinguish submucosal/muscularis (S/M) from lamina propria (LP) macrophages. Challenging the emerging paradigm, long-lived macrophages, identified by Tim-4 expression, were found in the LP and S/M. Long-lived LP macrophages are restrained in their response to proinflammatory stimulation compared to short-lived populations in the same location, and to the long-lived population within the S/M. Employing a novel Timd4creTgfbr2fl/fl mouse line we demonstrate distinct functions of TGF-{beta} on long-lived macrophages in these two compartments. Importantly, in Timd4creTgfbr2fl/fl mice, zonation of CD163+ macrophages in the S/M was lost, suggesting TGF-{beta} plays an unappreciated role in positioning of macrophages in the tissue. These data highlight the importance of considering ontogeny and niche when assessing the action of key intestinal regulatory signals.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection triggers pro-atherogenic inflammatory 1 responses in human coronary vessels\nAuthors: Eberhardt, N.; Noval, M. G.; Kaur, R.; Sajja, S.; Amadori, L.; Das, D.; Cilhoroz, B.; Stewart, O. J.; Fernandez, D. M.; Shamailova, R.; Guillen, A. V.; Jangra, S.; Schotsaert, M.; Gildea, M.; Newman, J.

J.; Giannarelli, C.\nScore: 257.9, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553245\nCOVID-19 patients present higher risk for myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, and stroke for up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.\nTertiary lymphoid structures are associated with enhanced macrophage and dendritic cell activation and proximity to CD8+ T cells, which better predict the clinical outcome of cervical cancer patients\nAuthors: Gorvel, L.; Panouillot, M.; Rouviere, M.-S.; Sonongbua, J.; Fattori, S.; Boucherit, N.; Ben Amara, A.; Quilichini, O.; GRANJEAUD, S.; Degos, C.; Carcopino, X.; Lambaudie, E.; Chretien, A.-S.; Sabatier, R.; Dieu-Nosjean, M.-C.; Olive, D.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.552583\nCervical tumors are usually treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and would benefit from immunotherapies. However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We integratedly evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, and specifically TLS importance, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor dosage, spatial interaction analyses, and statistical analyses. We demonstrate that TLS presence is associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation is associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and close proximity of activated conventional DC2 to CD8+ T cells, therefore indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associate TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density to improved progression-free survival, and present it as an independent prognostic marker. To conclude, our results provide an exhaustive depiction of the cervical tumor immune microenvironment where TLS presence marks cell activation and immunotherapy target expression. These findings may provide predictive clues for patient response to targeted immunotherapies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The tissues are the site of many of the most important immunological reactions, yet the immunology of the tissues has remained relatively opaque. Recent studies have identified Foxp3&#43; regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have saved millions of lives. However, variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged causing large numbers of breakthrough infections. These developments necessitated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. It has been reported that mucosal antibody levels in the upper respiratory tract, especially for secretory IgA (sIgA), correlate with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still unclear how high levels of mucosal antibodies can be induced. In this study, we measured serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA responses in individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccinations or who experienced breakthrough infections. We found that mRNA booster doses could induce robust serum and saliva IgG responses, especially in individuals who had not experienced infections before, but saliva sIgA responses were weak. In contrast, breakthrough infections in individuals who had received the primary mRNA vaccination series induced robust serum and saliva IgG as well as saliva sIgA responses. Individuals who had received a booster dose and then had a breakthrough infection showed low IgG induction in serum and saliva but still responded with robust saliva sIgA induction. These data suggest that upper respiratory tract exposure to antigen is an efficient way of inducing mucosal sIgA while exposure via intramuscular injection is not.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antigen processing is critical for producing epitope peptides that are presented by HLA molecules for T cell recognition. Therapeutic vaccines aim to harness these epitopes for priming cytotoxic T cell responses against cancer and pathogens, but insufficient processing often reduces vaccine efficacy through limiting the quantity of epitopes released. Here, we set out to improve antigen processing by harnessing protein degradation signals called degrons from the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We used machine learning to generate a computational model that ascribes a proteasomal degradation score between 0 and 100. Epitope peptides with varying degron activities were synthesized and translocated into cells using nontoxic anthrax proteins: protective antigen (PA) and the N-terminus of lethal factor (LFN). Immunogenicity studies revealed epitope sequences with a low score (&lt;25) show pronounced T-cell activation but epitope sequences with a higher score (&gt;75) provide limited activation. This work sheds light on the sequence-activity relationships between proteasomal degradation and epitope immunogenicity, through conserving the epitope region but varying the flanking sequence. We anticipate that future efforts to incorporate proteasomal degradation signals into vaccine designs will lead to enhanced cytotoxic T cell priming by vaccine therapeutics in clinical settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interferons and regulated cell death pathways counteract virus spread and mount immune responses, but their deregulation often results in inflammatory pathologies. The RIP-homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) is a conserved protein domain critical for assembling higher-order amyloid-like signaling complexes inducing cell death. A few DNA viruses employ viral RHIMs mimicking host RHIMs to alleviate cell death-mediated antiviral defenses. Whether RNA viruses operate such viral RHIMs remains unknown. Host RHIM-protein signaling promotes lung damage and cytokine storm in respiratory RNA virus infections, arguing the presence of viral RHIMs in RNA viruses. Here, we report the identification of novel viral RHIMs in Nsp13 and Nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2 and other bat RNA viruses and provide a basis for bats as the hosts for the evolution of RHIMs in RNA viruses. Nsp13 expression promoted CoV-RHIM-1-dependent cell death after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its RNA-binding channel conformation was critical for cell death function. Nsp13 interacted and promoted the formation of large insoluble complexes of ZBP1 and RIPK3. Unlike DNA virus RHIMs, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 did not restrict host RHIM-dependent cell death. Instead, it promoted ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling-mediated cell death dependent on intracellular RNA ligands. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments showed high Z-RNA forming propensity which bound to Z-RNA sensing Z domains and promoted Nsp13-dependent cell death. Our findings reveal the functional viral RHIMs in RNA viruses and the role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 in cell death associated with Z-RNAs and ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling, allowing the understanding of mechanisms of cellular damage and cytokine storm in respiratory virus infections and COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Effective immunity requires a large, diverse naive T cell repertoire circulating among lymphoid organs in search of antigen. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1PR1 contribute by both directing T cell migration and supporting T cell survival. Here, we address how S1P enables T cell survival, and the implications for patients treated with S1PR1 antagonists. Contrary to expectations, we found that S1PR1 limits apoptosis by maintaining the appropriate balance of BCL2 family members via restraint of JNK activity. Interestingly, the same residues of S1PR1 that enable receptor internalization are required to prevent this pro-apoptotic cascade. Findings in mice were recapitulated in ulcerative colitis patients treated with the S1PR1 antagonist ozanimod, and the loss of naive T cells limited B cell responses. Our findings highlight an unexpected effect of S1PR1 antagonists on the ability to mount immune responses within lymph nodes, beyond their effect on lymph node egress, and suggest both limitations and novel uses of this important class of drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IL-10 producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC210) have immunoregulatory functions, and limit harmful immune responses across various tissues. Despite their crucial roles in maintaining immune homeostasis, the cell therapy potential of human ILC210 has not been demonstrated, due to both limited numbers in human peripheral blood and lack of definitive markers for identification. Here, we isolate and expand circulating human ILC210, and assess their cell therapy potential in a humanized model of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Cell therapy with human ILC210 decreased GVHD severity and prolonged survival of NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}null (NSG) mice. Adoptive transfer of ILC210 inhibited pathogenic T cell proliferation and intestinal infiltration, and suppressed CD4&#43; Th1 and CD8&#43; Tc1 cells in an IL-4 and IL-10 dependent manner. Critically, increased proportions of ILC2s did not correlate with higher rates of cancer relapse in HSCT recipients, and adoptive transfer of ILC210 did not compromise graft-versus-leukemic (GVL) effects in a humanized model. Finally, we identify CD49d and CD86 as novel markers that discriminate ILC210 from conventional ILC2s. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing ILC210 in cell therapies for GVHD and other immune-driven pathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A critical aspect of a successful pandemic response is expedient antibody discovery, manufacturing and deployment of effective lifesaving treatments to patients around the world. However, typical drug discovery and development is a lengthy multi-step process that must align drug efficacy with multiple developability criteria and can take years to complete. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI), and especially machine learning (ML), have great potential to accelerate and improve the optimization of therapeutics, increasing their activity and safety as well as decreasing their development time and manufacturing costs. Here we present a novel, cost-effective and accelerated approach to therapeutic antibody discovery, that couples AI-designed human antibody libraries, biased for improved developability attributes with high throughput and sensitive screening technologies. The applicability of our platform for effective therapeutic antibody discovery is demonstrated here with the identification of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies that are novel, diverse and pharmacologically active. These first-generation antibodies, without the need for affinity maturation, bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with therapeutically-relevant specificity and affinity and display neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity across multiple strains. Altogether, this platform is well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response.

IMPORTANCEExpedient discovery and manufacturing of lifesaving therapeutics is critical for pandemic response. The recent COVID pandemic has highlighted the current inefficiencies and the need for improvements. To this end, we present our therapeutic antibody discovery platform that couples artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative high throughput technologies, and we demonstrate its applicability to rapid response. This platform enabled the isolation, characterization, and rapid identification of effective broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with good developability attributes, anticipated to fit our current process development and manufacturing platform. As such, this would benefit cost-of-goods and improve therapeutic access to patients. The AI-derived antibodies represent an advantageous therapeutic modality that can be developed and deployed fast, thus well suited for rapid response to infectious threats, such as pandemic response.</p>

In the intestine, a paradigm is emerging that long-lived macrophages are dominantly present in the muscular layer, while highly monocyte-replenished populations are found in the lamina propria beneath the epithelial barrier. Whether longevity is restricted in such a simplified manner has not been well explored. Moreover, the impact of specific gut-associated factors on long-lived macrophage functionality and niche occupancy is unknown. We generated sc-RNA-Seq data from wild-type and Ccr2-/- mice to identify phenotypic features of long-lived macrophage populations in distinct intestinal niches and identified CD163 as a useful marker to distinguish submucosal/muscularis (S/M) from lamina propria (LP) macrophages. Challenging the emerging paradigm, long-lived macrophages, identified by Tim-4 expression, were found in the LP and S/M. Long-lived LP macrophages are restrained in their response to proinflammatory stimulation compared to short-lived populations in the same location, and to the long-lived population within the S/M. Employing a novel Timd4creTgfbr2fl/fl mouse line we demonstrate distinct functions of TGF-{beta} on long-lived macrophages in these two compartments. Importantly, in Timd4creTgfbr2fl/fl mice, zonation of CD163&#43; macrophages in the S/M was lost, suggesting TGF-{beta} plays an unappreciated role in positioning of macrophages in the tissue. These data highlight the importance of considering ontogeny and niche when assessing the action of key intestinal regulatory signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 patients present higher risk for myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, and stroke for up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cervical tumors are usually treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and would benefit from immunotherapies. However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We integratedly evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, and specifically TLS importance, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor dosage, spatial interaction analyses, and statistical analyses. We demonstrate that TLS presence is associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation is associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and close proximity of activated conventional DC2 to CD8&#43; T cells, therefore indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associate TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density to improved progression-free survival, and present it as an independent prognostic marker. To conclude, our results provide an exhaustive depiction of the cervical tumor immune microenvironment where TLS presence marks cell activation and immunotherapy target expression. These findings may provide predictive clues for patient response to targeted immunotherapies.</p>
