E.; Raychaudhuri, S.\nScore: 49.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549939\nT cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.\nMegakaryocyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated IgG antibodies in mice\nAuthors: Mabrouk, M.; Jalali, F.; Zaid, N.; Naya, A.; Khyatti, M.; Khalki, L.; Guessous, F.; Zaid, Y.\nScore: 684.7, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549113\nMore than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.\nProlonged exposure to lung-derived cytokines is associated with inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19\nAuthors: Grant, R. A.; Poor, T. A.; Sichizya, L.; Diaz, E.; Bailey, J. I.; Soni, S.; Senkow, K. J.; Perez-Leonor, X. G.; Abdala-Valencia, H.; Lu, Z.; Donnelly, H. K.; Tighe, R. M.; Lomasney, J. W.; Wunderink, R. G.; Singer, B. D.; Misharin, A. V.; Budinger, G. R. S.; The NU SCRIPT Investigators, Score: 29.6, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550765\nNeurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-[a] and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2--molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.\nMurine classical monocyte subsets display distinct functions and fates\nAuthors: Trzebanski, S.; Kim, J.-S.; Larrossi, N.; Kancheva, D.; Bastos, J.; Haddad, M.; Aizik, D.; Kralova, J.; Gross-Vered, M.; Boura-Halfon, S.; Lapidot, T.; Alon, R.; Movahedi, K.; Jung, S.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551083\nMonocytes are short-lived myeloid immune cells that arise from adult haematopoiesis and circulate in the blood after maturation. Monocytes comprise two main subsets, that are in mice defined as classical Ly6Chigh and non-classical Ly6Clow cells (CM, NCM). Recent transcriptomic analyses suggest that CM themselves are heterogeneous. Here, we report surface markers that allow segregation of murine neutrophil-like and DC-like CM (NeuMo, DCMo) in the BM and blood. Functional characterization, including fate definition following adoptive cell transfer, established that NeuMo and DCMo can give equal rise to homeostatic CM progeny, such as NCM and gut macrophages. Fates differed, however, in selected other tissues, such as the lungs and brain meninges. Collectively, we provide comprehensive evidence for the existence of two functionally distinct CM subsets in the mouse, which differentially contribute to peripheral tissue macrophage populations, indicative of impact of monocyte ontogeny on in situ differentiation.\nResident memory T cell precursors in tumor draining lymph nodes require type-1 IFN for optimal differentiation\nAuthors: Khatwani, N.; Searles, T.; Han, J.; Messier, C.; Mittal, N.; Molodtsov, A.; Ramirez, D.; Hawkes, A.; Williams, O. M.; Huang, Y. H.; Kolling, F. W.; Rosato, P.; Turk, M. J.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551658\nResident memory (Trm) cells play an essential role in anti-tumor immunity. However, little is known about the precursors that differentiate into protective Trm populations against cancer. Here we employed an established model of B16 melanoma neoadjuvant anti-CD4 therapy, to track tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells through tissues and across time; from their priming as effectors to their differentiation into Trm. We show that tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) contain Teff cells that begin to express canonical Trm markers CD103 and CD69. These tumor-specific Teff cells seeded skin and tumor during the effector phase of the response, although egress from these tissues was not required Trm development in LNs. Paired scRNAseq/scTCRseq was used to identify Teff clonotypes in TDLNs and trace their differentiation, in real-time, into Trm populations. We found that expanded clonotypes favored the Trm fate and were unlikely to co-differentiate into other lineages. Precursors of Trm (pre-Trm) clonotypes that subsequently seeded populations throughout tumors, LNs, and skin, were characterized by early expression of tissue residency, stemness, and type-1 IFN sensing genes. These multipotent pre-Trm cells sensed plasmacytoid dendritic cell-derived type-1 interferons in TDLNs, and their expression of interferon alpha receptor was required for their formation of Trm populations in LNs but not in skin. These findings reveal the defining features of pre-Trm cells in response to tumor antigens, and reveal a previously unappreciated role for type-1 IFNs in programming regional Trm immunity to cancer.\nImmunities Specific to Both of the M Protein Ectodomain and RBD Synergize to Confer Cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 Infections\nAuthors: Tang, Y.; Tang, K.; Hu, Y.; Ye, Z.-W.; Luo, W.; Luo, C.; Cao, H.; Wang, R.; Liu, D.; Liu, C.; Ge, X.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, S.; Deng, L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551223\nThe effectiveness of the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine largely decreased overtime against the emerging virus strains, necessitating the universal vaccine development. The most abundant structural membrane (M) protein is highly conserved in amino acid sequence, which arouses our research interests in developing a universal immunogen based on it. Serological analysis showed that IgG responses specific to its N-terminal peptides can be strongly detected in many serum samples from both convalescent patients and vaccinees receiving inactivated vaccines, indicating the potential existence of human B-cell epitopes in reactive peptides. Microneutralization assays showed that the N-terminal peptide S2M2-30-specific hyperimmune serum was capable of cross-neutralizing the authentic viruses including wild-type HKU-001a, B.1.617.2/Delta, and Omicron subvariant BQ.1.1, and synergized with RBD-specific serum in reinforcing antiviral activities. Strong S2M2-30-specific immunities elicited in hACE2-transgenic mice could effectively inhibit B.1.1.7/Alpha (UK) infections. Our results suggest the potentiality of conserved M peptides as vaccine targets for conferring cross-protections against sarbecoviruses.\nSolution structure and synaptic analyses reveal molecular mechanisms of bispecific T cell engagers\nAuthors: Staufer, O.; Leithner, A.; Liberta, F.; Zhou, S.; Schiele, F.; Reindl, S.; Nar, H.; Hoerer, S.; Crames, M.; Comeau, S.; Young, D.; Low, S.; Jenkins, E.; Davis, S.

To gain insight into TcE performance, we investigated four TcE formats (A-D) that link the CD3{varepsilon} N-terminus to a membrane proximal site in Her2. The spacing between CD3{varepsilon} and Her2 was increased in ~4 nm steps (A",

        <p class="abstract">More than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-[a] and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2--molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monocytes are short-lived myeloid immune cells that arise from adult haematopoiesis and circulate in the blood after maturation. Monocytes comprise two main subsets, that are in mice defined as classical Ly6Chigh and non-classical Ly6Clow cells (CM, NCM). Recent transcriptomic analyses suggest that CM themselves are heterogeneous. Here, we report surface markers that allow segregation of murine neutrophil-like and DC-like CM (NeuMo, DCMo) in the BM and blood. Functional characterization, including fate definition following adoptive cell transfer, established that NeuMo and DCMo can give equal rise to homeostatic CM progeny, such as NCM and gut macrophages. Fates differed, however, in selected other tissues, such as the lungs and brain meninges. Collectively, we provide comprehensive evidence for the existence of two functionally distinct CM subsets in the mouse, which differentially contribute to peripheral tissue macrophage populations, indicative of impact of monocyte ontogeny on in situ differentiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resident memory (Trm) cells play an essential role in anti-tumor immunity. However, little is known about the precursors that differentiate into protective Trm populations against cancer. Here we employed an established model of B16 melanoma neoadjuvant anti-CD4 therapy, to track tumor antigen-specific CD8&#43; T cells through tissues and across time; from their priming as effectors to their differentiation into Trm. We show that tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) contain Teff cells that begin to express canonical Trm markers CD103 and CD69. These tumor-specific Teff cells seeded skin and tumor during the effector phase of the response, although egress from these tissues was not required Trm development in LNs. Paired scRNAseq/scTCRseq was used to identify Teff clonotypes in TDLNs and trace their differentiation, in real-time, into Trm populations. We found that expanded clonotypes favored the Trm fate and were unlikely to co-differentiate into other lineages. Precursors of Trm (pre-Trm) clonotypes that subsequently seeded populations throughout tumors, LNs, and skin, were characterized by early expression of tissue residency, stemness, and type-1 IFN sensing genes. These multipotent pre-Trm cells sensed plasmacytoid dendritic cell-derived type-1 interferons in TDLNs, and their expression of interferon alpha receptor was required for their formation of Trm populations in LNs but not in skin. These findings reveal the defining features of pre-Trm cells in response to tumor antigens, and reveal a previously unappreciated role for type-1 IFNs in programming regional Trm immunity to cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The effectiveness of the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine largely decreased overtime against the emerging virus strains, necessitating the universal vaccine development. The most abundant structural membrane (M) protein is highly conserved in amino acid sequence, which arouses our research interests in developing a universal immunogen based on it. Serological analysis showed that IgG responses specific to its N-terminal peptides can be strongly detected in many serum samples from both convalescent patients and vaccinees receiving inactivated vaccines, indicating the potential existence of human B-cell epitopes in reactive peptides. Microneutralization assays showed that the N-terminal peptide S2M2-30-specific hyperimmune serum was capable of cross-neutralizing the authentic viruses including wild-type HKU-001a, B.1.617.2/Delta, and Omicron subvariant BQ.1.1, and synergized with RBD-specific serum in reinforcing antiviral activities. Strong S2M2-30-specific immunities elicited in hACE2-transgenic mice could effectively inhibit B.1.1.7/Alpha (UK) infections. Our results suggest the potentiality of conserved M peptides as vaccine targets for conferring cross-protections against sarbecoviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bispecific T-cell engagers (TcEs) link the T-cell receptor to a tumour associated antigen on cancerous cells to form a tumoricidal immunological synapse (IS). To gain insight into TcE performance, we investigated four TcE formats (A-D) that link the CD3{varepsilon} N-terminus to a membrane proximal site in Her2. The spacing between CD3{varepsilon} and Her2 was increased in ~4 nm steps (A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D) through combinations of single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen-binding fragments (Fab), linked to the hinge of the crystallizable fragment (Fc), or by linking an scFv to the base of the Fc. TcEs mediated equivalent adhesion, but cytotoxic potency followed A&gt;B=C&gt;D. To measure the TcE-determined distance between the membrane anchoring sites of CD3{varepsilon} and Her2 we performed small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), revealing sub-13 nm distances for Formats A and B, but larger distances for C and D ([&amp;ge;]18 nm). IS-parameters for A-C included similar close membrane apposition, fast IS formation and robust CD45 exclusion, whereas D displayed greater membrane separation, slow IS formation, and modest CD45 exclusion. TcE recruitment of co-stimulatory CD2-CD58 interactions followed the relationship A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D. Our results suggest a sequence of events, mediated by TcEs: 1.) adhesion, 2.) CD45 exclusion and 3.) co-stimulation recruitment. The most potent Format (A) performs 1-3, the intermediate Formats (B-C) fully achieve 1-2, and the least effective Format (D) reaches only 1. We speculate that the 18 nm-distance complex, formed by Format C, used in approved TcEs, undergoes tilting in the IS to exclude CD45, but this is suboptimal for CD2-CD58 recruitment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adjuvants have been essential to malaria vaccine development, but their impact on the vaccine-induced antibody repertoire is poorly understood. Here, we used cDNA sequences from antigen-specific single memory B cells to express 132 recombinant human anti-Pfs230 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Alhydrogel(R)-induced mAbs demonstrated higher binding to Pfs230D1, although functional activity was similar between adjuvants. All Alhydrogel(R) mAbs using IGHV1-69 gene bound to recombinant Pfs230D1, but none blocked parasite transmission to mosquitoes; similarly, no AS01 mAb using IGHV1-69 blocked transmission. Functional mAbs from both Alhydrogel(R) and AS01 vaccines used IGHV3-21 and IGHV3-30 genes. Antibodies with the longest CDR3 sequences were associated with binding but not functional activity. This study assesses adjuvant effects on antibody clonotype diversity during malaria vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">TIM3 is a co-regulatory receptor that is highly expressed on multiple immune cell types, including on T cells after prolonged exposure to antigen. It marks functionally suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the tumor microenvironment. However, it is unresolved whether TIM3 acts directly on suppressed CTL. Moreover, the nature of TIM3 ligands remains controversial. Paradoxically, TIM3 combines inhibitory function in vivo with costimulatory signaling capability in vitro. Here we have investigated TIM3 in the direct interaction of suppressed murine and human CTL with tumor target cell using spheroids. TIM3 directly inhibited the function of such CTL. TIM3 regulated the ability of suppressed CTL to polarize their cytoskeleton as a required step in cytolysis. Expression of CEACAM1 in cis, on the CTL, blocked TIM3 function, expression of CEACAM1 and galectin9 in trans, on the tumor target cells, enhanced TIM3 function. TIM3 only functioned as an inhibitory receptor on the spheroid-suppressed CTL, not on active CTL in a two-dimensional tissue culture model. These data suggest that TIM3 amplifies T cell function, serving as a co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory receptor depending on the functional context of the T cell it is expressed on.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motivation: Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF) analysis has been influential in immunometabolism research, measuring cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to determine immune cell metabolic profiles. However, Seahorse XF has several limitations, relying on purified adherent cells, relatively high cell numbers, and specialized equipment and reagents. Recently, a novel flow cytometry-based technique called SCENITH (Single Cell Energetic metabolism by profiling Translation inhibition) was introduced, which measures cellular protein synthesis through puromycin staining as a proxy for metabolic activity in single cells. The current limitation of SCENITH is its reliance on a specific anti-puromycin antibody that is not commercially available. To address this, we propose an alternative approach using biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to measure protein synthesis. Summary: The field of immunometabolism has revealed that cellular energy metabolism significantly contributes to immune cell function. Disturbances in immune cell metabolism have been associated with various diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer. To further advance immunometabolic research, developing novel methods to study the metabolism of immune cells in complex samples is required. Here, we introduce SCENITH-BONCAT, an adapted version of SCENITH which utilizes click-labeling of homopropargylglycine (HPG), an alkyne-bearing methionine analog, to measure protein synthesis as a proxy of metabolic activity. SCENITH-BONCAT successfully reproduced known metabolic signatures of immune cell activation. Specifically, LPS/IFN{gamma}-induced classical activation increased glycolytic capacity, and IL-4-induced alternative activation enhanced mitochondrial dependence in human macrophages. The assay&#39;s applicability was further explored in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers, revealing diverse metabolic rewiring in immune cell subsets upon stimulation with different activators. Cryopreserved PBMCs showed reduced HPG incorporation and mitochondrial dependence compared to freshly isolated cells, warranting attention to cellular mitochondrial health during cryopreservation. Finally, SCENITH-BONCAT was used to analyze murine tissue-resident immune cells from different organs. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed tissue-specific clustering based on metabolic profiles, likely driven by microenvironmental priming of tissue-resident immune cells. In conclusion, SCENITH-BONCAT offers valuable insights into immune cell metabolic responses and presents a powerful platform for studying immune cell metabolism in complex samples and tissue-resident immune populations in both human and murine studies.</p>
