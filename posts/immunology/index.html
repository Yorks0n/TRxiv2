Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.\nRegulation of BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by MIZ1-TIMBIM4 safeguards IgG1+ GC B cell positive selection\nAuthors: Zhang, L.; Toboso-Navasa, A.; Gunawan, A.; Camara, A.; Nakagawa, R.; Finsterbusch, K.; Chakravarty, P.; Newman, R.; Zhang, Y.; Eilers, M.; Wack, A.; Tolar, P.; Toellner, K.-M.; Calado, D. P.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549490\nThe transition from IgM to affinity-matured IgG antibodies is vital for effective humoral immunity. This is facilitated by germinal centers (GCs) through affinity maturation and preferential accumulation of IgG+ B cells over IgM+ B cells. However, it is not known whether the positive selection of the different immunoglobulin isotypes within GCs varies in its dependency on specific transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we identified IgG1+ GC B cell transcription factor dependency using CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional mouse genetics. We found that MIZ1 was specifically required for IgG1+ GC B cell survival during positive selection, whereas IgM+ GC B cells were largely independent. Mechanistically, MIZ1 induced TMBIM4, an ancestral anti-apoptotic protein that regulated inositol trisphosphate receptor mediated Ca2+ mobilization downstream of IgG1. The MIZ1-TMBIM4 axis prevented mitochondrial dysfunction-induced IgG1+ GC cell death caused by excessive Ca2+ accumulation. This study uncovers a unique immunoglobulin isotype-specific dependency, on a hitherto unidentified mechanism in GC positive selection.\nThe T cell receptor sequence influences the likelihood of T cell memory formation\nAuthors: Lagattuta, K. A.; Nathan, A.; Rumker, L.; Birnbaum, M. E.; Raychaudhuri, S.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549939\nT cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.\nThe transcriptional response in mosquitoes distinguishes between fungi and bacteria but not Gram types\nAuthors: Hixson, B.; Huot, L.; Morejon, B.; Yang, X.; Nagy, P.; Michel, K.; Buchon, N.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550663\nMosquitoes are prolific vectors of human pathogens; a clear and accurate understanding of the organization of their antimicrobial defenses is crucial for informing the development of transmission control strategies. The canonical infection response in insects, as described in the insect model Drosophila melanogaster, is pathogen type-dependent, with distinct stereotypical responses to Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria/fungi mediated by the activation of the Imd and Toll pathways, respectively. To determine whether this pathogen-specific discrimination is shared by mosquitoes, we used RNAseq to capture the genome-wide transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) to systemic infection with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, as well as challenge with heat-killed Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal pathogens. From the resulting data, we found that Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae both mount a core response to all categories of infection, and this response is highly conserved between the two species with respect to both function and orthology. When we compared the transcriptomes of mosquitoes infected with different types of bacteria, we observed that the intensity of the transcriptional response was correlated with both the virulence and growth rate of the infecting pathogen. Exhaustive comparisons of the transcriptomes of Gram-negative-challenged versus Gram-positive-challenged mosquitoes yielded no difference in either species. In Ae. aegypti, however, we identified transcriptional signatures specific to bacterial infection and to fungal infection. The bacterial infection response was dominated by the expression of defensins and cecropins, while the fungal infection response included the disproportionate upregulation of an uncharacterized family of glycine-rich proteins. These signatures were also observed in Ae. aegypti challenged with heat-killed bacteria and fungi, indicating that this species can discriminate between molecular patterns that are specific to bacteria and to fungi.\nMicroglia at Sites of Atrophy Restrict the Progression of Retinal Degeneration via Galectin-3 and Trem2 Interactions\nAuthors: Yu, C.; Lad, E. M.; Mathew, R.; Littleton, S.; Chen, Y.; Schlepckow, K.; Degan, S.; Chew, L.; Amason, J.; Kalnitsky, J.; Bowes Rickman, C.; Proia, A. D.; Colonna, M.; Haass, C.; Saban, D.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549403\nDegenerative diseases of the outer retina, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are characterized by atrophy of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In these blinding diseases, macrophages are known to accumulate ectopically at sites of atrophy, but their ontogeny and functional specialization within this atrophic niche remain poorly understood, especially in the human context. Here, we uncovered a transcriptionally unique profile of microglia, marked by galectin-3 upregulation, at atrophic sites in mouse models of retinal degeneration and in human AMD. Using disease models, we found that conditional deletion of galectin-3 in microglia led to defects in phagocytosis and consequent augmented photoreceptor death, RPE damage and vision loss, suggestive of a protective role. Mechanistically, Trem2 signaling orchestrated the migration of microglial cells to sites of atrophy, and there, induced galectin-3 expression. Moreover, pharmacologic Trem2 agonization led to heightened protection, but only in a galectin-3-dependent manner, further signifying the functional interdependence of these two molecules. Likewise in elderly human subjects, we identified a highly conserved population of microglia at the transcriptomic, protein and spatial levels, and this population was enriched in the macular region of postmortem AMD subjects. Collectively, our findings reveal an atrophy-associated specialization of microglia that restricts the progression of retinal degeneration in mice and further suggest that these protective microglia are conserved in AMD. One Sentence SummaryA common neuroprotective response of microglia at the site of retinal atrophy is identified in mice and humans.\nM2-polarized macrophages prevent preterm birth and improve neonatal survival and immunity\nAuthors: Garcia-Flores, V.; Liu, Z.; Romero, R.; Xu, Y.; Miller, D.; Galaz, J.; Winters, A. D.; Farias-Jofre, M.; Theis, K. R.; Gomez-Lopez, N.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549717\nPreterm birth (PTB), commonly preceded by preterm labor, is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that most cases of preterm labor are associated with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI), an inflammatory condition without detectable microorganisms. To date, no successful strategies to treat SIAI have been developed. Herein, we present mechanistic proof that treatment with M2-polarized macrophages (M2 M{Phi}) can effectively prevent SIAI-induced PTB and neonatal mortality. M2 M{Phi} halt the premature pathway of labor by infiltrating maternal and fetal compartments, where they inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by HMGB1. Furthermore, M2 M{Phi} dampen the HMGB1-induced inflammatory response in the amniotic cavity and fetal lung. Notably, neonates exposed to HMGB1 in utero display a reduced capacity to clear bacterial infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis, which are restored by M2 M{Phi} treatment. Our findings provide cogent evidence that M2 M{Phi} can serve as a cellular strategy to mitigate PTB and decrease neonatal mortality.\nPreferential differential gene expression within the WC1.1+ γδ T cell compartment in cattle naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis.\nAuthors: Bhat, S. A.; Elnaggar, M.; Hall, T. J.; McHugo, G.; Reid, C.; MacHugh, D. E.; Meade, K. G.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550071\nBovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in {gamma}{delta} T cells - a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and function of specific {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally M. bovis-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-{gamma} ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. {gamma}{delta} T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (n = 10-12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1+, WC1.2+, WC1- and {gamma}{delta}-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (n = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the M. bovis-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1+ {gamma}{delta} T cell compartment (absolute log2 FC [\u0026ge;] 1.5 and FDR Padj. [\u0026le;] 0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB+ cattle and included genes encoding transcription factors (TBX21 and EOMES), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR7), granzymes (GZMA, GZMM, and GZMH) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1+ {gamma}{delta} T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with M. bovis.\nA humoral stress response protects Drosophila tissues from antimicrobial peptides\nAuthors: Rommelaere, S.; Carboni, A.; Bada Juarez, J. F.; Boquete, J.-P.; Abriata, L. A.; Teixeira Pinto Meireles, F.; Rukes, V.; Vincent, C. M.; Kondo, S.; Dionne, M. S.; Dal Peraro, M.; Cao, C.; Lemaitre, B.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550293\nThe immune response against an invading pathogen is generally associated with collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. Consequently, several resilience mechanisms have evolved to attenuate the negative impacts of immune effectors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that contribute to innate defenses by targeting negatively charged membranes of microbes1, 2. While being protective against pathogens, AMPs can be cytotoxic to host cells1, 3. Little is known of mechanisms that protect host tissues from AMP-induced immunopathology. Here, we reveal that a family of stress-induced proteins, the Turandots4, 5, protect Drosophila host tissues from AMPs, increasing resilience to stress. Deletion of several Turandot genes increases fly susceptibility to environmental stresses due to trachea apoptosis and poor oxygen supply. Tracheal cell membranes expose high levels of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid, sensitizing them to the action of AMPs. Turandots are secreted from the fat body upon stress and bind to tracheal cells to protect them against AMPs. In vitro, Turandot A binds to phosphatidylserine on membranes and inhibits the pore-forming activity of Drosophila and human AMPs on eukaryotic cells without affecting their microbicidal activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Turandot stress proteins mitigate AMP cytotoxicity to host tissues and therefore improve their efficacy. This provides a first example of a humoral mechanism used by animals limiting host-encoded AMP collateral damages.\nRepeated Omicron exposures override ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting\nAuthors: Yisimayi, A.; Song, W.; Wang, J.; Jian, F.; Yu, Y.; Chen, X.; Xu, Y.; Yang, S.; Niu, X.; Xiao, T.; Wang, J.; Zhao, L.; Sun, H.; An, R.; Zhang, N.; Wang, Y.; Wang, P.; Yu, L.; Lv, Z.; Gu, Q.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Shen, Z.; Wang, Y.; Xie, X. S.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 595.6, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.01.538516\nThe continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.\nProlonged exposure to lung-derived cytokines is associated with inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19\nAuthors: Grant, R. A.; Poor, T. A.; Sichizya, L.; Diaz, E.; Bailey, J. I.; Soni, S.; Senkow, K. J.; Perez-Leonor, X. G.; Abdala-Valencia, H.; Lu, Z.; Donnelly, H. K.; Tighe, R. M.; Lomasney, J. W.; Wunderink, R. G.; Singer, B. D.; Misharin, A. V.; Budinger, G. R. S.; The NU SCRIPT Investigators, Score: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550765\nNeurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF- and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-19, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2 - molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.\n",

        <p class="abstract">More than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transition from IgM to affinity-matured IgG antibodies is vital for effective humoral immunity. This is facilitated by germinal centers (GCs) through affinity maturation and preferential accumulation of IgG&#43; B cells over IgM&#43; B cells. However, it is not known whether the positive selection of the different immunoglobulin isotypes within GCs varies in its dependency on specific transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we identified IgG1&#43; GC B cell transcription factor dependency using CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional mouse genetics. We found that MIZ1 was specifically required for IgG1&#43; GC B cell survival during positive selection, whereas IgM&#43; GC B cells were largely independent. Mechanistically, MIZ1 induced TMBIM4, an ancestral anti-apoptotic protein that regulated inositol trisphosphate receptor mediated Ca2&#43; mobilization downstream of IgG1. The MIZ1-TMBIM4 axis prevented mitochondrial dysfunction-induced IgG1&#43; GC cell death caused by excessive Ca2&#43; accumulation. This study uncovers a unique immunoglobulin isotype-specific dependency, on a hitherto unidentified mechanism in GC positive selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes are prolific vectors of human pathogens; a clear and accurate understanding of the organization of their antimicrobial defenses is crucial for informing the development of transmission control strategies. The canonical infection response in insects, as described in the insect model Drosophila melanogaster, is pathogen type-dependent, with distinct stereotypical responses to Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria/fungi mediated by the activation of the Imd and Toll pathways, respectively. To determine whether this pathogen-specific discrimination is shared by mosquitoes, we used RNAseq to capture the genome-wide transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) to systemic infection with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, as well as challenge with heat-killed Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal pathogens. From the resulting data, we found that Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae both mount a core response to all categories of infection, and this response is highly conserved between the two species with respect to both function and orthology. When we compared the transcriptomes of mosquitoes infected with different types of bacteria, we observed that the intensity of the transcriptional response was correlated with both the virulence and growth rate of the infecting pathogen. Exhaustive comparisons of the transcriptomes of Gram-negative-challenged versus Gram-positive-challenged mosquitoes yielded no difference in either species. In Ae. aegypti, however, we identified transcriptional signatures specific to bacterial infection and to fungal infection. The bacterial infection response was dominated by the expression of defensins and cecropins, while the fungal infection response included the disproportionate upregulation of an uncharacterized family of glycine-rich proteins. These signatures were also observed in Ae. aegypti challenged with heat-killed bacteria and fungi, indicating that this species can discriminate between molecular patterns that are specific to bacteria and to fungi.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Degenerative diseases of the outer retina, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are characterized by atrophy of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In these blinding diseases, macrophages are known to accumulate ectopically at sites of atrophy, but their ontogeny and functional specialization within this atrophic niche remain poorly understood, especially in the human context. Here, we uncovered a transcriptionally unique profile of microglia, marked by galectin-3 upregulation, at atrophic sites in mouse models of retinal degeneration and in human AMD. Using disease models, we found that conditional deletion of galectin-3 in microglia led to defects in phagocytosis and consequent augmented photoreceptor death, RPE damage and vision loss, suggestive of a protective role.

Mechanistically, Trem2 signaling orchestrated the migration of microglial cells to sites of atrophy, and there, induced galectin-3 expression. Moreover, pharmacologic Trem2 agonization led to heightened protection, but only in a galectin-3-dependent manner, further signifying the functional interdependence of these two molecules. Likewise in elderly human subjects, we identified a highly conserved population of microglia at the transcriptomic, protein and spatial levels, and this population was enriched in the macular region of postmortem AMD subjects. Collectively, our findings reveal an atrophy-associated specialization of microglia that restricts the progression of retinal degeneration in mice and further suggest that these protective microglia are conserved in AMD.

        <p class="abstract">Preterm birth (PTB), commonly preceded by preterm labor, is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that most cases of preterm labor are associated with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI), an inflammatory condition without detectable microorganisms. To date, no successful strategies to treat SIAI have been developed. Herein, we present mechanistic proof that treatment with M2-polarized macrophages (M2 M{Phi}) can effectively prevent SIAI-induced PTB and neonatal mortality. M2 M{Phi} halt the premature pathway of labor by infiltrating maternal and fetal compartments, where they inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by HMGB1. Furthermore, M2 M{Phi} dampen the HMGB1-induced inflammatory response in the amniotic cavity and fetal lung. Notably, neonates exposed to HMGB1 in utero display a reduced capacity to clear bacterial infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis, which are restored by M2 M{Phi} treatment. Our findings provide cogent evidence that M2 M{Phi} can serve as a cellular strategy to mitigate PTB and decrease neonatal mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in {gamma}{delta} T cells - a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and function of specific {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally M. bovis-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-{gamma} ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. {gamma}{delta} T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (n = 10-12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1&#43;, WC1.2&#43;, WC1- and {gamma}{delta}-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (n = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the M. bovis-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1&#43; {gamma}{delta} T cell compartment (absolute log2 FC [&amp;ge;] 1.5 and FDR Padj. [&amp;le;] 0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB&#43; cattle and included genes encoding transcription factors (TBX21 and EOMES), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR7), granzymes (GZMA, GZMM, and GZMH) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1&#43; {gamma}{delta} T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with M. bovis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immune response against an invading pathogen is generally associated with collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. Consequently, several resilience mechanisms have evolved to attenuate the negative impacts of immune effectors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that contribute to innate defenses by targeting negatively charged membranes of microbes1, 2. While being protective against pathogens, AMPs can be cytotoxic to host cells1, 3. Little is known of mechanisms that protect host tissues from AMP-induced immunopathology. Here, we reveal that a family of stress-induced proteins, the Turandots4, 5, protect Drosophila host tissues from AMPs, increasing resilience to stress. Deletion of several Turandot genes increases fly susceptibility to environmental stresses due to trachea apoptosis and poor oxygen supply. Tracheal cell membranes expose high levels of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid, sensitizing them to the action of AMPs. Turandots are secreted from the fat body upon stress and bind to tracheal cells to protect them against AMPs. In vitro, Turandot A binds to phosphatidylserine on membranes and inhibits the pore-forming activity of Drosophila and human AMPs on eukaryotic cells without affecting their microbicidal activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Turandot stress proteins mitigate AMP cytotoxicity to host tissues and therefore improve their efficacy. This provides a first example of a humoral mechanism used by animals limiting host-encoded AMP collateral damages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF- and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-19, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2 - molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.</p>
