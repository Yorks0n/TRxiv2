E.; Ying, B.; Liang, C.-Y.; Garcia-Salum, T.; Santana, A. C.; Caten, F. T.; Urban, J. F.; Elbashir, S. M.; Edwards, D. K.; Ribeiro, S. P.; Thackray, L. B.; Sekaly, R.-P. K.; Diamond, M. S.\nScore: 52.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575588\nAlthough vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nmRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccine lipids induce low level complement activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines: Mechanisms, effects of complement inhibitors, and relevance to adverse reactions\nAuthors: Bakos, T.; Meszaros, T.; Kozma, G. T.; Berenyi, P.; Facsko, R.; Farkas, H.; Dezsi, L.; Heirman, C.; de Koker, S.; Schiffelers, R.; Glatter, K. A.; Radovits, T.; Szenasi, G.; Szebeni, J.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575122\nMessenger RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) enabled widespread COVID-19 vaccination with a small fraction of vaccine recipients displaying acute or sub-acute inflammatory symptoms. The molecular mechanism of these adverse events (AEs) remains undetermined. Here we report that the mRNA-LNP vaccine, Comirnaty, triggers low-level complement (C) activation and production of inflammatory cytokines, which may be key underlying processes of inflammatory AEs. In serum, Comirnaty and the control PEGylated liposome (Doxebo) caused different rises of C split products, C5a, sC5b-9, Bb and C4d, indicating stimulation of the classical pathway of C activation mainly by the liposomes, while a stronger stimulation of the alternative pathway was equal with the vaccine and the liposomes. Spikevax had similar C activation as Comirnaty, but viral or synthetic mRNAs had no such effect. In autologous serum-supplemented peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, Comirnaty caused increases in the levels of sC5b-9 and proinflammatory cytokines in the following order: IL-1 \u003c IFN-{gamma} \u003c IL-1{beta} \u003c TNF- \u003c IL-6 \u003c IL-8, whereas heatinactivation of serum prevented the rises of IL-1, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-. Clinical C inhibitors, Soliris and Berinert, suppressed vaccine-induced C activation in serum but did not affect cytokine production when applied individually. These findings suggest that the PEGylated lipid coating of mRNA-LNP nanoparticles can trigger C activation mainly via the alternative pathway, which may be causally related to the induction of some, but not all inflammatory cytokines. While innate immune stimulation is essential for the vaccines efficacy, concurrent production of C- and PBMC-derived inflammatory mediators may contribute to some of the AEs. Pharmacological attenuation of harmful cytokine production using C inhibitors likely requires blocking the C cascade at multiple points.\nHybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 arises from serological recall of IgG antibodies distinctly imprinted by infection or vaccination\nAuthors: Voss, W. N.; Mallory, M. A.; Byrne, P. O.; Marchioni, J. M.; Knudson, S. A.; Powers, J. M.; Leist, S. R.; Dadonaite, B.; Townsend, D. R.; Kain, J.; Huang, Y.; Satterwhite, E.; Castillo, I. N.; Mattocks, M.; Paresi, C.; Munt, J. E.; Scobey, T.; Seeger, A.; Premkumar, L.; Bloom, J. D.; Georgiou, G.; McLellan, J. S.; Baric, R. S.; Lavinder, J. J.; Ippolito, G. C.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576742\nWe used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (\"hybrid immunity\"). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with \u003e60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD \u003c 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 ~0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.\nEstrogen-related differences in antitumor immunity and the gut microbiome contribute to sexual dimorphism of colorectal cancer\nAuthors: Lattanzi, G.; Perillo, F.; Diaz Basabe, A.; Caridi, B.; Amoroso, C.; Baeri, A.; Cirrincione, E.; Ghidini, M.; Galassi, B.; Cassinotti, E.; Baldari, L.; Boni, L.; Vecchi, M.; Caprioli, F.; Facciotti, F.; Strati, F.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576009\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifaceted disease whose development and progression varies depending on tumor location, age of patients, infiltration of immune cells within cancer lesions, and the tumor microenvironment. These pathophysiological characteristics are additionally influenced by sex-related differences. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and shapes anti-tumor immune responses but how the responsiveness of the immune system to the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of CRC is largely unknown. Here, we studied survival, tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations and tumor-associated microbiome of a cohort of n=184 male and female CRC patients and functionally tested the immune system-microbiome interactions in in vivo and in vitro models of the disease. High-dimensional single-cell flow cytometry showed that female patients are enriched by tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells but depleted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The enrichment of oral pathobionts and a reduction of {beta}-glucuronidase activity are distinctive traits characterizing the gut microbiome of women affected by CRC. Functional assays using a collection of human primary iNKT cell lines demonstrated that the gut microbiota of female patients functionally impairs iNKT cell anti-tumor functions interfering with the granzyme-perforin cytotoxic pathway. These results highlight a sex-dependent functional relationship between the gut microbiome, estrogen metabolism, and the decline of cytotoxic T cell responses, contributing to the sexual dimorphism observed in CRC patients with relevant implications for precision medicine and the design of targeted therapeutic approaches addressing sex bias in cancer.\nAcute exercise increases systemic kynurenine pathway metabolites and activates the AHR in human PBMCs\nAuthors: Joisten, N.; Walzik, D.; Schenk, A.; Metcalfe, A. J.; Belen, S.; Schaaf, K.; Jacko, D.; Gehlert, S.; Spiliopoulou, P.; Garzinsky, A.-M.; Thevis, M.; Rappelt, L.; Donath, L.; Meuth, S. G.; Bloch, W.; Zimmer, P.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576018\nThe kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation generates several metabolites such as kynurenine or kynurenic acid that serve as endogenous ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Due to its distinct biological roles particularly modulating the immune system, the AHR is a current therapeutic target across different inflammation-related diseases. Here, we show an exercise-induced increase in AHR ligand availability on a systemic level and a kynurenine pathway activation in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). Concurrently, the AHR is activated in PBMCs following acute exercise, with effects being dependent on exercise intensity. In conclusion, these data indicate a novel mechanistic link how exercise modulates the immune system through the kynurenine pathway-AHR axis, potentially underlying exercise-induced benefits in various chronic diseases.\nIron deficiency in people with obesity drives defective natural killer cell mitochondrial fitness and function\nAuthors: DeBarra, C.; Ryan, E.; Sugrue, M.; Ryan, O.; Lynn, E.; Heneghan, H. M.; McCarthy, C.; Moynagh, P. N.; Sinclair, L. V.; Jones, N.; Hogan, A.; O Shea, D.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575005\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.\nDNA origami vaccine (DoriVac) nanoparticles improve both humoral and cellular immune responses to infectious diseases\nAuthors: Zeng, Y.; Young, O.; Si, L.; Ku, M. W.; Isinelli, G.; Rajwar, A.; Jiang, A.; Wintersinger, C.; Graveline, A.; Vernet, A.; Sanchez, M.; Ryu, J. H.; Kwon, I. C.; Goyal, G.; Ingber, D.; Shih, W.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573647\nCurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine platform, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific HR2 peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular immune responses in human cells. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities. The programmability of this platform underscores its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.\nCompetitive fungal commensalism mitigates candidiasis pathology\nAuthors: Kralova, J. S.; Donic, C.; Dassa, B.; Livyatan, I.; Jansen, P.; Ben-Dor, S.; Fidel, E.; Trzebanski, S.; Narunsky-Haziza, L.; Assaf, O.; Brenner, O.; Dafni, H.; Jona, G.; Boura-Halfon, S.; Stettner, N.; Segal, E.; Brunke, S.; Pilpel, Y. T.; Straussman, R.; Zeevi, D.; Bacher, P.; Hube, B.; Shlezinger, N.; Jung, S.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575358\nThe mycobiota are a critical part of the gut microbiome, but host-fungal interactions and specific functional contributions of commensal fungi to host fitness remain incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of a new fungal commensal, Kazachstania heterogenica var. weizmannii, isolated from murine intestines. K. weizmannii exposure prevented Candida albicans colonization and significantly reduced the commensal C. albicans burden in colonized animals. Following immunosuppression of C. albicans colonized mice, competitive fungal commensalism thereby mitigated fatal candidiasis. Metagenome analysis revealed K. weizmannii presence among human commensals. Our results reveal competitive fungal commensalism within the intestinal microbiota, independent of bacteria and immune responses, that could bear potential therapeutic value for the management of C. albicans-mediated diseases.\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing reveals recruitment of the M2-like CCL8high macrophages in Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice following hypofractionated radiotherapy\nAuthors: Yang, H.; Lei, Z.; He, J.; Zhang, L.; Lai, T.; Zhou, L.; Wang, N.; Tang, Z.; Sui, J.; Wu, Y.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575792\nTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a crucial factor in reprogramming the tumor microenvironment following radiotherapy. The mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated. Here, we seek to investigate the effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy on macrophages dynamics in a subcutaneous Lewis lung carcinoma murine model. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a distinct M2-like population of macrophages with high Ccl8 expression level post-hypofractionated radiotherapy. Remarkbly, hypofractionated radiotherapy promoted CCL8high macrophages infiltration and reprogrammed them by upregulating immunosuppressive genes and downregulating antigen-presenting genes, leading to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Further, we demonstrated that hypofractionated radiotherapy amplified the CCL signaling pathway, enhancing the pro-tumorigenic functions of CCL8high macrophages and promoting macrophages recruitment. The combination therapy of hypofractionated radiotherapy with the CCL signal inhibitor Bindarit was effective in reducing M2 macrophages infiltration and extending the duration of local tumor control. This research highlights the potential of targeting TAMs and introduces a novel combination to improve the efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy.\nTranslation initiation or elongation inhibition triggers contrasting effects on Caenorhabditis elegans survival during pathogen infection\nAuthors: Ghosh, A.; Singh, J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575653\nDiverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although vaccines have reduced COVID-19 disease burden, their efficacy in helminth infection endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal hookworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared to animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth mediated suppression of spike-specific CD8&#43; T cell responses occurred independently of STAT6 signaling, whereas blockade of IL-10 rescued vaccine-induced CD8&#43; T cell responses. In mice, intestinal helminth infection impairs vaccine induced T cell responses via an IL-10 pathway and compromises protection against antigenically shifted SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Messenger RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) enabled widespread COVID-19 vaccination with a small fraction of vaccine recipients displaying acute or sub-acute inflammatory symptoms. The molecular mechanism of these adverse events (AEs) remains undetermined. Here we report that the mRNA-LNP vaccine, Comirnaty, triggers low-level complement (C) activation and production of inflammatory cytokines, which may be key underlying processes of inflammatory AEs. In serum, Comirnaty and the control PEGylated liposome (Doxebo) caused different rises of C split products, C5a, sC5b-9, Bb and C4d, indicating stimulation of the classical pathway of C activation mainly by the liposomes, while a stronger stimulation of the alternative pathway was equal with the vaccine and the liposomes. Spikevax had similar C activation as Comirnaty, but viral or synthetic mRNAs had no such effect. In autologous serum-supplemented peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, Comirnaty caused increases in the levels of sC5b-9 and proinflammatory cytokines in the following order: IL-1 &lt; IFN-{gamma} &lt; IL-1{beta} &lt; TNF- &lt; IL-6 &lt; IL-8, whereas heatinactivation of serum prevented the rises of IL-1, IL-1{beta}, and TNF-. Clinical C inhibitors, Soliris and Berinert, suppressed vaccine-induced C activation in serum but did not affect cytokine production when applied individually. These findings suggest that the PEGylated lipid coating of mRNA-LNP nanoparticles can trigger C activation mainly via the alternative pathway, which may be causally related to the induction of some, but not all inflammatory cytokines. While innate immune stimulation is essential for the vaccines efficacy, concurrent production of C- and PBMC-derived inflammatory mediators may contribute to some of the AEs. Pharmacological attenuation of harmful cytokine production using C inhibitors likely requires blocking the C cascade at multiple points.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We used plasma IgG proteomics to study the molecular composition and temporal durability of polyclonal IgG antibodies triggered by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or their combination (&#34;hybrid immunity&#34;). Infection, whether primary or post-vaccination, mainly triggered an anti-spike antibody response to the S2 domain, while vaccination predominantly induced anti-RBD antibodies. Immunological imprinting persisted after a secondary (hybrid) exposure, with &gt;60% of the ensuing serological response originating from the initial antibodies generated during the first exposure. We highlight one instance where hybrid immunity arising from breakthrough infection resulted in a marked increase in the breadth and affinity of a highly abundant vaccination-elicited plasma IgG antibody, SC27. With an intrinsic binding affinity surpassing a theoretical maximum (KD &lt; 5 pM), SC27 demonstrated potent neutralization of various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-like zoonotic viruses (IC50 ~0.1-1.75 nM) and provided robust protection in vivo. Cryo-EM structural analysis unveiled that SC27 binds to the RBD class 1/4 epitope, with both VH and VL significantly contributing to the binding interface. These findings suggest that exceptionally broad and potent antibodies can be prevalent in plasma and can largely dictate the nature of serological neutralization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifaceted disease whose development and progression varies depending on tumor location, age of patients, infiltration of immune cells within cancer lesions, and the tumor microenvironment. These pathophysiological characteristics are additionally influenced by sex-related differences. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and shapes anti-tumor immune responses but how the responsiveness of the immune system to the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the sexual dimorphism of CRC is largely unknown. Here, we studied survival, tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations and tumor-associated microbiome of a cohort of n=184 male and female CRC patients and functionally tested the immune system-microbiome interactions in in vivo and in vitro models of the disease. High-dimensional single-cell flow cytometry showed that female patients are enriched by tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells but depleted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The enrichment of oral pathobionts and a reduction of {beta}-glucuronidase activity are distinctive traits characterizing the gut microbiome of women affected by CRC. Functional assays using a collection of human primary iNKT cell lines demonstrated that the gut microbiota of female patients functionally impairs iNKT cell anti-tumor functions interfering with the granzyme-perforin cytotoxic pathway. These results highlight a sex-dependent functional relationship between the gut microbiome, estrogen metabolism, and the decline of cytotoxic T cell responses, contributing to the sexual dimorphism observed in CRC patients with relevant implications for precision medicine and the design of targeted therapeutic approaches addressing sex bias in cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation generates several metabolites such as kynurenine or kynurenic acid that serve as endogenous ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Due to its distinct biological roles particularly modulating the immune system, the AHR is a current therapeutic target across different inflammation-related diseases. Here, we show an exercise-induced increase in AHR ligand availability on a systemic level and a kynurenine pathway activation in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). Concurrently, the AHR is activated in PBMCs following acute exercise, with effects being dependent on exercise intensity. In conclusion, these data indicate a novel mechanistic link how exercise modulates the immune system through the kynurenine pathway-AHR axis, potentially underlying exercise-induced benefits in various chronic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate effector lymphocytes, involved in host-defences against viral infections and cancer. Upon activation, NK cells can produce a milieu of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines, which can directly target infected and transformed cells, but also amplify an immune response. Metabolic rewiring underpins NK cell effector functionality, providing the required signals, energy and biointermediates to support their immune responses. Obesity is associated with significant defects in the functionality of human NK cells, especially in the periphery. Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been demonstrated to be a major mechanistic driver of the reported defects. However, how obesity links to defective NK cell metabolism and functionality remains unclear. Iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in people living with obesity (PWO). Recent studies have highlighted the importance for iron in host immunity, with murine models of iron deficiency resulting in defective cellular metabolism and function. We hypothesized that obesity-driven iron deficiency might underpin the reported defects in NK cells. Our data demonstrates that in response to cytokine stimulation, healthy human NK cells utilize iron to support their metabolic activity and cytokine responses. In a cohort of PWO, we demonstrate alterations in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production. Furthermore, upon stratification into PWO with normal iron status versus low iron status, we show the observed obesity-related defects in NK cell metabolism, mitochondrial fitness and cytokine production are concentrated in the PWO with low-iron status. Collectively, our data highlights the importance of iron for human NK cell responses and provides evidence that obesity-driven defects in NK cell metabolism and function are linked in part to altered iron availability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4&#43; T cell activation, however CD8&#43; responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine platform, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific HR2 peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4&#43; T cells, and CD8&#43; T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular immune responses in human cells. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities. The programmability of this platform underscores its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mycobiota are a critical part of the gut microbiome, but host-fungal interactions and specific functional contributions of commensal fungi to host fitness remain incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of a new fungal commensal, Kazachstania heterogenica var. weizmannii, isolated from murine intestines. K. weizmannii exposure prevented Candida albicans colonization and significantly reduced the commensal C. albicans burden in colonized animals. Following immunosuppression of C. albicans colonized mice, competitive fungal commensalism thereby mitigated fatal candidiasis. Metagenome analysis revealed K. weizmannii presence among human commensals. Our results reveal competitive fungal commensalism within the intestinal microbiota, independent of bacteria and immune responses, that could bear potential therapeutic value for the management of C. albicans-mediated diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a crucial factor in reprogramming the tumor microenvironment following radiotherapy. The mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated. Here, we seek to investigate the effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy on macrophages dynamics in a subcutaneous Lewis lung carcinoma murine model. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a distinct M2-like population of macrophages with high Ccl8 expression level post-hypofractionated radiotherapy. Remarkbly, hypofractionated radiotherapy promoted CCL8high macrophages infiltration and reprogrammed them by upregulating immunosuppressive genes and downregulating antigen-presenting genes, leading to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Further, we demonstrated that hypofractionated radiotherapy amplified the CCL signaling pathway, enhancing the pro-tumorigenic functions of CCL8high macrophages and promoting macrophages recruitment. The combination therapy of hypofractionated radiotherapy with the CCL signal inhibitor Bindarit was effective in reducing M2 macrophages infiltration and extending the duration of local tumor control. This research highlights the potential of targeting TAMs and introduces a novel combination to improve the efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse microbial pathogens are known to attenuate host protein synthesis. Consequently, the host mounts a defense response against protein translation inhibition, leading to increased transcript levels of immune genes. The seemingly paradoxical upregulation of immune gene transcripts in response to blocked protein synthesis suggests that the defense mechanism against translation inhibition may not universally benefit host survival. However, a comprehensive assessment of host survival on pathogens upon blockage of different stages of protein synthesis is currently lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of knockdown of various translation initiation and elongation factors on the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intriguingly, we observe contrasting effects on C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa exposure upon inhibition of initiation and elongation factors. While inhibiting both initiation and elongation factors leads to an upregulation of immune gene expression and reduced colonization of the C. elegans gut by P. aeruginosa, inhibiting initiation factors proves beneficial, whereas inhibiting elongation factors proves detrimental to C. elegans survival. We demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor, ZIP-2, mediates both the advantageous and deleterious effects of inhibiting translation initiation and elongation. Therefore, our findings unveil the opposing roles of translation initiation and elongation in C. elegans survival during P. aeruginosa infection, with the same transcription factor, ZIP-2, orchestrating these opposing effects.</p>
