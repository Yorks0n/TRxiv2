The reduction of humoral immunity due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has signaled the need for an update to vaccine composition. A strain change for all authorized/approved vaccines to a monovalent composition with Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 has been supported by the WHO, EMA, and FDA. Here, we demonstrate that immunization with a monovalent recombinant spike protein COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax, Inc.) based on the subvariant XBB.1.5 induces cross-neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1, and XBB.1.16.6 subvariants, promotes higher pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers than bivalent (Prototype + XBB.1.5) vaccine, induces SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Th1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses against XBB subvariants, and robustly boosts antibody responses in mice and nonhuman primates primed with a variety of monovalent and bivalent vaccines. Together, these data support updating the Novavax vaccine to a monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation for the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination campaign.\nImmune Evasion and Membrane Fusion of SARS-CoV-2 XBB Subvariants EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3\nAuthors: Faraone, J. N.; Qu, P.; Goodarzi, N.; Zheng, Y.-M.; Carlin, C.; Saif, L. J.; Oltz, E. M.; Xu, K.; Jones, D.; Gumina, R. J.; Liu, S.-L.\nScore: 51.4, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555188\nImmune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 paired with immune imprinting from monovalent mRNA vaccines has resulted in attenuated neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron subvariants. In this study, we characterized two new XBB variants rising in circulation -- EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3, for their ability of neutralization and syncytia formation. We determined the neutralizing antibody in sera of individuals that received a bivalent mRNA vaccine booster, BA.4/5-wave infection, or XBB.1.5-wave infection. Bivalent vaccination-induced antibodies neutralized efficiently ancestral D614G, but to a much less extent, two new EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 variants. In fact, the enhanced neutralization escape of EG.5.1 appeared to be driven by its key defining mutation XBB.1.5-F456L. Notably, infection by BA.4/5 or XBB.1.5 afforded little, if any, neutralization against EG.5.1, XBB.2.3 and previous XBB variants -- especially in unvaccinated individuals, with average neutralizing antibody titers near the limit of detection. Additionally, we investigated the infectivity, fusion activity, and processing of variant spikes for EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 in HEK293T-ACE2 and CaLu-3 cells but found no significant differences compared to earlier XBB variants. Overall, our findings highlight the continued immune evasion of new Omicron subvariants and, more importantly, the need to reformulate mRNA vaccines to include XBB spikes for better protection.\nConvergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 XBB lineages on receptor-binding domain 455-456 enhances antibody evasion and ACE2 binding\nAuthors: Jian, F.; Yang, S.; Yu, Y.; Song, W.; Yisimayi, A.; Chen, X.; Xu, Y.; Wang, P.; Yu, L.; Wang, J.; Liu, L.; Niu, X.; Wang, J.; Xiao, T.; Gu, Q.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Shen, Z.; Wang, Y.; Cao, Y. R.\nScore: 48.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555211\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) XBB lineages have achieved dominance worldwide and keep on evolving. Convergent evolution of XBB lineages on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) L455F and F456L is observed, resulting in variants like EG.5, FL.1.5.1, XBB.1.5.70, and HK.3. Here, we show that neutralizing antibody (NAb) evasion drives the convergent evolution of F456L, while the epistatic shift caused by F456L enables the subsequent convergence of L455F through ACE2 binding enhancement and further immune evasion. Specifically, L455F and F456L evades Class 1 NAbs, which could reduce the neutralization efficacy of XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfection convalescent plasma. Importantly, L455F single substitution significantly dampens receptor binding; however, the combination of L455F and F456L forms an adjacent residue flipping, which leads to enhanced NAbs resistance and ACE2 binding affinity. Our results indicate the evolution flexibility contributed by epistasis cannot be underestimated, and the evolution potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains high.\nAltered DNA methylation underlies monocyte dysregulation and innate exhaustion memory in sepsis\nAuthors: Caldwell, B. A.; Wu, Y.; Wang, J.; Li, L.\nScore: 42.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555580\nInnate immune memory is the process by which pathogen exposure elicits cell-intrinsic states to alter the strength of future immune challenges. Such altered memory states drive monocyte dysregulation during sepsis, promoting pathogenic behavior characterized by pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive gene expression in concert with emergency hematopoiesis. Epigenetic changes, notably in the form of histone modifications, have been shown to underlie innate immune memory, but the contribution of DNA methylation to this process remains poorly understood. Using an ex vivo sepsis model, we discovered broad changes in DNA methylation throughout the genome of exhausted monocytes, including at several genes previously implicated as major drivers of immune dysregulation during sepsis and Covid-19 infection (e.g. Plac8). Methylome alterations are driven in part by Wnt signaling inhibition in exhausted monocytes, and can be reversed through treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, Wnt agonists, or immune training molecules. Importantly, these changes are recapitulated in septic mice following cecal slurry injection, resulting in stable changes at critical immune genes that support the involvement of DNA methylation in acute and long-term monocyte dysregulation during sepsis.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection triggers pro-atherogenic inflammatory 1 responses in human coronary vessels\nAuthors: Eberhardt, N.; Noval, M.

While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.\nMucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination and breakthrough infection\nAuthors: Bhavsar, D.; Singh, G.; Sano, K.; Gleason, C.; Srivastava, K.; Carreno, J. M.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.\nScore: 54.9, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554732\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have saved millions of lives. However, variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged causing large numbers of breakthrough infections. These developments necessitated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. It has been reported that mucosal antibody levels in the upper respiratory tract, especially for secretory IgA (sIgA), correlate with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still unclear how high levels of mucosal antibodies can be induced. In this study, we measured serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA responses in individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccinations or who experienced breakthrough infections. We found that mRNA booster doses could induce robust serum and saliva IgG responses, especially in individuals who had not experienced infections before, but saliva sIgA responses were weak. In contrast, breakthrough infections in individuals who had received the primary mRNA vaccination series induced robust serum and saliva IgG as well as saliva sIgA responses. Individuals who had received a booster dose and then had a breakthrough infection showed low IgG induction in serum and saliva but still responded with robust saliva sIgA induction. These data suggest that upper respiratory tract exposure to antigen is an efficient way of inducing mucosal sIgA while exposure via intramuscular injection is not. ImportanceAntibodies on mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract have been shown to be important for protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigate the induction of serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA after COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccination or breakthrough infections.\nNiche-specific macrophage loss promotes skin capillary aging\nAuthors: Mesa, K. R.; O'Connor, K. A.; Ng, C.; Salvatore, S.; Littman, D. R.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554832\nAll mammalian organs depend upon resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair processes and facilitate tissue-specific functions1-3. Recent work has established that functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through some combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment4,5. Moreover, decline in macrophage abundance and function in tissues has been shown to contribute to many age-associated pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration6-8. Despite these advances, the cellular mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within an aging tissue niche remain largely unknown. Here we show that capillary- associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, which contributes to impaired vascular repair and tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behavior in vivo, we have employed intravital two-photon microscopy to non-invasively image in live mice the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined model of niche aging that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost with age at a rate that outpaces that of capillary loss, leading to the progressive accumulation of capillary niches without an associated macrophage in both mice and humans. Phagocytic activity of CAMs was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-less niches selectively vulnerable to both homeostatic and injury-induced loss in blood flow. Our work demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is not as finely tuned as has been previously suggested9-11. Specifically, we found that neighboring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize sufficiently to maintain an optimal population across the skin capillary niche in the absence of additional cues from acute tissue damage or increased abundance of growth factors, such as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Such limitations in homeostatic renewal and organization of various niche-resident cell types are potentially early contributors to tissue aging, which may provide novel opportunities for future therapeutic interventions.\nUnanticipated interacting features of human gut-associated lymphoid tissues link microbiota, intestinal immunity and autoimmunity\nAuthors: Montorsi, L.; Pitcher, M.

D.; Spencer, J.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555265\nGut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is organised lymphoid tissue that is chronically activated by the intestinal microbiota. It generates the IgA response that is critical for intestinal homeostasis. By iterative application of multiplexed technologies, we identify enrichment of double-negative 2 (DN2:CD27-IgD-CD21 lo CD11c hi) B cells in GALT, where they comprise the majority of intraepithelial and subepithelial B cells. We show that DN2 B cells in GALT interact with DC in the sub-epithelial dome that express DNASE1L3 and microbicides. Unlike in mice, DNASE1L3 in humans does not associate with apoptotic debris, but is located between sampled bacteria and host tissue where it is co-expressed with C1Q, consistent with management of bacterial debris. Thus we demonstrate that DN2 B cells that are otherwise associated with lupus nephritis, and DNASE1L3 and C1q that are lupus autoantigens, are microbiota-associated, interacting components of normal intestinal immunity.\nCD8 T-cell dysfunction is linked with CAR T-cell failure and can be mitigated by a non-alpha IL-2 agonist, pegenzileukin\nAuthors: Reville, P.

R.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555127\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been a breakthrough for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). However, suboptimal CAR T-cell activity can lead to therapeutic failure and dismal outcome. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of rrLBCL tumors, we identify a prominent population of clonally expanded dysfunctional CAR+ CD8 T-cells indicative of ongoing tumor cell engagement, proliferation, and dysfunction at the time of progression from CAR T-cell therapy. Furthermore, we show that rrLBCL patient-derived CAR T-cells are more prone to dysfunction and loss of cytotoxicity compared to healthy donor-derived CAR T-cells. Using both antigen-driven and CAR-driven models of T-cell dysfunction, we show that pegenzileukin, a non-alpha IL2 agonist, can prevent T-cell dysfunction. In both in vitro and in vivo CAR T-cell models, pegenzileukin improved T-cell expansion and tumor control. This provides pre-clinical rational for use of pegenzileukin in combatting T-cell dysfunction, a central mechanism of CAR T-cell failure. HIGHLIGHTSO_LITumor-infiltrating CD8 CAR T-cells show clonal expansion and dysfunction at the time of progression.

Advancing our understanding of these responses might lead to the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of common immune disorders such as allergies. Here we identified a hitherto elusive subset of atypical IgD class-switched IgD+IgM-memory (IgD-ME) B cells that were clonally related to IgD+IgM- germinal center (IgD-GC) B cells and IgD-secreting IgD+IgM- plasma cells (IgD-PCs) but not anergic IgD+IgM- B cells. Consistent with their pre-plasmacellular properties, IgD-ME B cells served as preferential precursors of IgD-PCs over IgD-GC B cells. By showing that IgD antibodies from IgD+IgM- cells acquired reactivity to multiple oral, airborne and commensal antigens via a mutation-dependent pathway involving both innate and adaptive signals, our findings suggest that IgD-ME B cells form a ready-to-use pre-plasmacellular reservoir for steady-state IgD responses possibly aimed at enhancing nasopharyngeal homeostasis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Monovalent SARS-CoV-2 Prototype (Wuhan-Hu-1) and bivalent (Prototype &#43; BA.4/5) COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated a waning of vaccine-mediated immunity highlighted by lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB sub-variants. The reduction of humoral immunity due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has signaled the need for an update to vaccine composition. A strain change for all authorized/approved vaccines to a monovalent composition with Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 has been supported by the WHO, EMA, and FDA. Here, we demonstrate that immunization with a monovalent recombinant spike protein COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax, Inc.) based on the subvariant XBB.1.5 induces cross-neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1, and XBB.1.16.6 subvariants, promotes higher pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers than bivalent (Prototype &#43; XBB.1.5) vaccine, induces SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Th1-biased CD4&#43; T-cell responses against XBB subvariants, and robustly boosts antibody responses in mice and nonhuman primates primed with a variety of monovalent and bivalent vaccines. Together, these data support updating the Novavax vaccine to a monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation for the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination campaign.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 paired with immune imprinting from monovalent mRNA vaccines has resulted in attenuated neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron subvariants. In this study, we characterized two new XBB variants rising in circulation -- EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3, for their ability of neutralization and syncytia formation. We determined the neutralizing antibody in sera of individuals that received a bivalent mRNA vaccine booster, BA.4/5-wave infection, or XBB.1.5-wave infection. Bivalent vaccination-induced antibodies neutralized efficiently ancestral D614G, but to a much less extent, two new EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 variants. In fact, the enhanced neutralization escape of EG.5.1 appeared to be driven by its key defining mutation XBB.1.5-F456L. Notably, infection by BA.4/5 or XBB.1.5 afforded little, if any, neutralization against EG.5.1, XBB.2.3 and previous XBB variants -- especially in unvaccinated individuals, with average neutralizing antibody titers near the limit of detection. Additionally, we investigated the infectivity, fusion activity, and processing of variant spikes for EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 in HEK293T-ACE2 and CaLu-3 cells but found no significant differences compared to earlier XBB variants. Overall, our findings highlight the continued immune evasion of new Omicron subvariants and, more importantly, the need to reformulate mRNA vaccines to include XBB spikes for better protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) XBB lineages have achieved dominance worldwide and keep on evolving. Convergent evolution of XBB lineages on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) L455F and F456L is observed, resulting in variants like EG.5, FL.1.5.1, XBB.1.5.70, and HK.3. Here, we show that neutralizing antibody (NAb) evasion drives the convergent evolution of F456L, while the epistatic shift caused by F456L enables the subsequent convergence of L455F through ACE2 binding enhancement and further immune evasion. Specifically, L455F and F456L evades Class 1 NAbs, which could reduce the neutralization efficacy of XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfection convalescent plasma. Importantly, L455F single substitution significantly dampens receptor binding; however, the combination of L455F and F456L forms an adjacent residue flipping, which leads to enhanced NAbs resistance and ACE2 binding affinity. Our results indicate the evolution flexibility contributed by epistasis cannot be underestimated, and the evolution potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains high.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Innate immune memory is the process by which pathogen exposure elicits cell-intrinsic states to alter the strength of future immune challenges. Such altered memory states drive monocyte dysregulation during sepsis, promoting pathogenic behavior characterized by pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive gene expression in concert with emergency hematopoiesis. Epigenetic changes, notably in the form of histone modifications, have been shown to underlie innate immune memory, but the contribution of DNA methylation to this process remains poorly understood. Using an ex vivo sepsis model, we discovered broad changes in DNA methylation throughout the genome of exhausted monocytes, including at several genes previously implicated as major drivers of immune dysregulation during sepsis and Covid-19 infection (e.g. Plac8). Methylome alterations are driven in part by Wnt signaling inhibition in exhausted monocytes, and can be reversed through treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, Wnt agonists, or immune training molecules. Importantly, these changes are recapitulated in septic mice following cecal slurry injection, resulting in stable changes at critical immune genes that support the involvement of DNA methylation in acute and long-term monocyte dysregulation during sepsis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 patients present higher risk for myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, and stroke for up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have saved millions of lives. However, variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged causing large numbers of breakthrough infections. These developments necessitated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. It has been reported that mucosal antibody levels in the upper respiratory tract, especially for secretory IgA (sIgA), correlate with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still unclear how high levels of mucosal antibodies can be induced. In this study, we measured serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA responses in individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccinations or who experienced breakthrough infections. We found that mRNA booster doses could induce robust serum and saliva IgG responses, especially in individuals who had not experienced infections before, but saliva sIgA responses were weak. In contrast, breakthrough infections in individuals who had received the primary mRNA vaccination series induced robust serum and saliva IgG as well as saliva sIgA responses. Individuals who had received a booster dose and then had a breakthrough infection showed low IgG induction in serum and saliva but still responded with robust saliva sIgA induction. These data suggest that upper respiratory tract exposure to antigen is an efficient way of inducing mucosal sIgA while exposure via intramuscular injection is not.

ImportanceAntibodies on mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract have been shown to be important for protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigate the induction of serum IgG, saliva IgG and saliva sIgA after COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccination or breakthrough infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All mammalian organs depend upon resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair processes and facilitate tissue-specific functions1-3. Recent work has established that functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through some combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment4,5. Moreover, decline in macrophage abundance and function in tissues has been shown to contribute to many age-associated pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration6-8. Despite these advances, the cellular mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within an aging tissue niche remain largely unknown. Here we show that capillary- associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, which contributes to impaired vascular repair and tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behavior in vivo, we have employed intravital two-photon microscopy to non-invasively image in live mice the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined model of niche aging that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost with age at a rate that outpaces that of capillary loss, leading to the progressive accumulation of capillary niches without an associated macrophage in both mice and humans. Phagocytic activity of CAMs was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-less niches selectively vulnerable to both homeostatic and injury-induced loss in blood flow. Our work demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is not as finely tuned as has been previously suggested9-11. Specifically, we found that neighboring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize sufficiently to maintain an optimal population across the skin capillary niche in the absence of additional cues from acute tissue damage or increased abundance of growth factors, such as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Such limitations in homeostatic renewal and organization of various niche-resident cell types are potentially early contributors to tissue aging, which may provide novel opportunities for future therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is organised lymphoid tissue that is chronically activated by the intestinal microbiota. It generates the IgA response that is critical for intestinal homeostasis. By iterative application of multiplexed technologies, we identify enrichment of double-negative 2 (DN2:CD27-IgD-CD21 lo CD11c hi) B cells in GALT, where they comprise the majority of intraepithelial and subepithelial B cells. We show that DN2 B cells in GALT interact with DC in the sub-epithelial dome that express DNASE1L3 and microbicides. Unlike in mice, DNASE1L3 in humans does not associate with apoptotic debris, but is located between sampled bacteria and host tissue where it is co-expressed with C1Q, consistent with management of bacterial debris. Thus we demonstrate that DN2 B cells that are otherwise associated with lupus nephritis, and DNASE1L3 and C1q that are lupus autoantigens, are microbiota-associated, interacting components of normal intestinal immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been a breakthrough for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). However, suboptimal CAR T-cell activity can lead to therapeutic failure and dismal outcome. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of rrLBCL tumors, we identify a prominent population of clonally expanded dysfunctional CAR&#43; CD8 T-cells indicative of ongoing tumor cell engagement, proliferation, and dysfunction at the time of progression from CAR T-cell therapy. Furthermore, we show that rrLBCL patient-derived CAR T-cells are more prone to dysfunction and loss of cytotoxicity compared to healthy donor-derived CAR T-cells. Using both antigen-driven and CAR-driven models of T-cell dysfunction, we show that pegenzileukin, a non-alpha IL2 agonist, can prevent T-cell dysfunction. In both in vitro and in vivo CAR T-cell models, pegenzileukin improved T-cell expansion and tumor control. This provides pre-clinical rational for use of pegenzileukin in combatting T-cell dysfunction, a central mechanism of CAR T-cell failure.

        <p class="abstract">The human nasopharyngeal mucosa includes organized lymphoepithelial structures, called tonsils, continually engaged in frontline immune responses to aerodigestive antigens. Advancing our understanding of these responses might lead to the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of common immune disorders such as allergies. Here we identified a hitherto elusive subset of atypical IgD class-switched IgD&#43;IgM-memory (IgD-ME) B cells that were clonally related to IgD&#43;IgM- germinal center (IgD-GC) B cells and IgD-secreting IgD&#43;IgM- plasma cells (IgD-PCs) but not anergic IgD&#43;IgM- B cells. Consistent with their pre-plasmacellular properties, IgD-ME B cells served as preferential precursors of IgD-PCs over IgD-GC B cells. By showing that IgD antibodies from IgD&#43;IgM- cells acquired reactivity to multiple oral, airborne and commensal antigens via a mutation-dependent pathway involving both innate and adaptive signals, our findings suggest that IgD-ME B cells form a ready-to-use pre-plasmacellular reservoir for steady-state IgD responses possibly aimed at enhancing nasopharyngeal homeostasis.</p>
