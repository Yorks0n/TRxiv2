A.; Valdez, R.; Gherasim, C.; Gordon, A.; Liu, L.; Ho, D. D.\nScore: 1020.6, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568730\nCOVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-Co-V-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,764-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.\nPersistent immune imprinting after XBB.1.5 COVID vaccination in humans\nAuthors: Tortorici, M. A.; Addetia, A.; Seo, A. J.; Brown, J.; Sprouse, K.; Logue, J.; Clarke, E.; Franko, N.; Chu, H.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 237.4, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569129\nImmune imprinting - also known as original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.\nInterpretable Inflammation Landscape of Circulating Immune cells\nAuthors: Jimenez-Gracia, L.; Maspero, D.; Aguilar-Fernandez, S.; Craighero, F.; Ruiz, S.; Marchese, D.; Caratu, G.; Elosua-Bayes, M.; Abdalfatah, M.; Sanzo-Machuca, A.; M.

C.; Marsal\nScore: 54.7, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568839\nInflammation is a biological phenomenon involved in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although a controlled inflammatory response is beneficial for restoring homeostasis, it can become unfavorable if dysregulated. In recent years, major progress has been made in characterizing acute and chronic inflammation in specific diseases. However, a global, holistic understanding of inflammation is still elusive. This is particularly intriguing, considering the crucial function of inflammation for human health and its potential for modern medicine if fully deciphered. Here, we leverage advances in the field of single-cell genomics to delineate the full spectrum of circulating immune cell activation underlying inflammatory processes during infection, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our single-cell atlas of \u003e2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 356 patients and 18 diseases allowed us to learn a foundation model of inflammation in circulating immune cells. The atlas expanded our current knowledge of the biology of inflammation of acute (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis) and chronic (e.g. cirrhosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) disease processes and laid the foundation to develop a precision medicine framework using unsupervised as well as explainable machine learning. Beyond a disease-centered classification, we charted altered activity of inflammatory molecules in peripheral blood cells, depicting functional biomarkers to further understand mechanisms of inflammation. Finally, we have laid the groundwork for developing precision medicine diagnostic tools for patients experiencing severe acute or chronic inflammation by learning a classifier for inflammatory diseases, presenting cells in circulation as a powerful resource for patient stratification.\nFast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 to JN.1 under heavy immune pressure\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Yu, Y.; Xu, Y.; Jian, F.; Song, W.; Yisimayi, A.; Wang, P.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Yu, L.; Niu, X.; Wang, J.; Wang, Y.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Wang, Y.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 327.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566860\nWhile the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5+L452R+F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5+L455F+F456L+A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.\nAntiviral innate immune memory in alveolar macrophages following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAuthors: Lercher, A.; Cheong, J.-G.; Jiang, C.; Hoffmann, H.-H.; Ashbrook, A. W.; Yin, Y. S.; Quirk, C.; DeGrace, E. J.; Chiriboga, L.; Rosenberg, B. R.; Josefowicz, S. Z.; Rice, C. M.\nScore: 34.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568354\nPathogen encounter results in long-lasting epigenetic imprinting that shapes diseases caused by heterologous pathogens. The breadth of this innate immune memory is of particular interest in the context of respiratory pathogens with increased pandemic potential and wide-ranging impact on global health. Here, we investigated epigenetic imprinting across cell lineages in a disease relevant murine model of SARS-CoV-2 recovery. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased chromatin accessibility of type I interferon (IFN-I) related transcription factors in airway-resident macrophages. Mechanistically, establishment of this innate immune memory required viral pattern recognition and canonical IFN-I signaling and augmented secondary antiviral responses. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection ameliorated disease caused by the heterologous respiratory pathogen influenza A virus. Insights into innate immune memory and how it affects subsequent infections with heterologous pathogens to influence disease pathology could facilitate the development of broadly effective therapeutic strategies.\nDurable immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in both lower and upper airways achieved with a gorilla adenovirus (GRAd) S-2P vaccine in non-human primates\nAuthors: Moliva, J. I.; Andrew, S. F.; Flynn, B. J.; Wagner, D. A.; Foulds, K. E.; Gagne, M.; Flebbe, D. R.; Lamb, E.; Provost, S.; Marquez, J.; Mychalowych, A.; Lorag, C.; Honeycutt, C. C.; Burnett, M. R.; McCormick, L.; Henry, A. R.; Godbole, S.; Davis-Gardner, M. E.; Minai, M.; Bok, K. W.; Nagata, B. M.; Todd, J.-P. M.; McCarthy, E.; Dodson, A.; Kouneski, K.; Cook, A.; Pessaint, L.; Van Ry, A.; Valentin, D.; Young, S.; Littman, Y.; Boon, A. C. M.; Suthar, M. S.; Lewis, M. G.; Andersen, H.; Alves, D. A.; Woodward, R.; Leuzzi, A.; Vitelli, A.; Colloca, S.; Folgori, A.; Raggiolli, A.; Capone, S.; Nason\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.567930\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a global threat, and current vaccines, while effective against severe illness, fall short in preventing transmission. To address this challenge, theres a need for vaccines that induce mucosal immunity and can rapidly control the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that a single immunization with a novel gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine (GRAd) carrying the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein (S-2P) in non-human primates provided protective immunity for over one year against the BA.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2. A prime-boost regimen using GRAd followed by adjuvanted S-2P (GRAd+S-2P) accelerated viral clearance in both the lower and upper airways. GRAd delivered via aerosol (GRAd(AE)+S-2P) modestly improved protection compared to its matched intramuscular regimen, but showed dramatically superior boosting by mRNA and, importantly, total virus clearance in the upper airway by day 4 post infection. GrAd vaccination regimens elicited robust and durable systemic and mucosal antibody responses to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, but only GRAd(AE)+S-2P generated long-lasting T cell responses in the lung. This research underscores the flexibility of the GRAd vaccine platform to provide durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in both the lower and upper airways.\nThe immune landscape of the inflamed joint defined by spectral flow cytometry\nAuthors: Attrill, M. H.; Shinko, D.; Alexiou, V.; Kartawinata, M.; Wedderburn, L. R.; CHARMS study, ; JIAP study, ; Pesenacker, A. M.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569010\nCellular phenotype and function are altered in different microenvironments. For targeted therapies it is important to understand site-specific cellular adaptations. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is characterised by joint inflammation, with frequent inadequate treatment responses. To comprehensively assess the inflammatory immune landscape, we designed a 37-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel delineating mononuclear cells from JIA synovial fluid (SF), compared to JIA and healthy control blood. Synovial monocytes and NK cells lack the Fc-receptor CD16, suggesting antibody-mediated targeting may be ineffective. B cells and DCs, both in small frequencies in SF, undergo maturation with high 4-1BB, CD71, CD39 expression, supporting T cell activation. SF effector and regulatory T cells were highly active with newly described co-receptor combinations that may alter function, and suggestion of metabolic reprogramming via CD71, TNFR2 and PD-1. Most SF effector phenotypes, as well as an identified CD4-Foxp3+ T cell population, were restricted to the inflamed joint, yet specific SF-predominant Treg (CD4+Foxp3+) subpopulations were increased in blood of active but not inactive JIA, suggesting possible recirculation and loss of immunoregulation at distal sites. This first comprehensive dataset of the site-specific inflammatory landscape at protein level will inform functional studies and the development of targeted therapeutics to restore immunoregulatory balance and achieve remission in JIA.\nPathogenic IgE-fated B cell memory retains functional plasticity\nAuthors: Bruton, K.; Phelps, A.; Ariaz, A.; Walker, T.; Wen, J.; Khavkine-Binstock, S. S.; Fang, A.; Mann-Delany, O.; Knudsen, N. P. H.; Gadkar, S.; Grydziuszko, E.; Koenig, J. F.; Gagnon, A.; Waserman, S.; Andersen, P. S.; Jordana, M.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.567094\nLong-lived immunoglobulin (Ig) E responses against innocuous environmental and dietary antigens (Ags) are maintained by an IgG1-dominant memory B cell (MBC) compartment primed for IL-4 responsiveness. In this work, we investigated the plasticity of the MBC compartment fated for IgE class switch recombination upon Ag re-exposure. Antibody-mediated IL-4R( blockade augmented the germinal center response and uncovered an IL-4/IL-13 dependency within the type 2 memory B cell (MBC2) skewed phenotype. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling during the recall response, a long-lived Ag-specific IgG2c MBC population emerged, shifting the MBC response away from a type 2 phenotype and towards type 1. The emergence of this IgG2c response was dependent on IFN-( signaling and arose from both unswitched and class-switched Ag-specific B cells in vivo. We further demonstrated that a type 1-polarizing adjuvant can augment the redirection of type 2-polarized class-switched MBCs, suggesting with the correct cues pathogenic MBCs can be functionally reprogrammed. One Sentence SummaryB cell responses to allergens can be reprogrammed away from a pathogenic fate through IL-4/IL-13 signaling blockade.\nMemory B cells dominate the early antibody-secreting cell response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in naive individuals independently of their antibody affinity\nAuthors: Li, Z.; Obraztsova, A.; Shang, F.; Oludada, O. E.; Malapit, J.; Busch, K.; van Straaten, M.; Stebbins, E.; Murugan, R.; Wardemann, H.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569639\nMemory B cells (MBCs) formed over the individual's lifetime constitute nearly half of the adult peripheral blood B cell repertoire in humans. To assess their response to novel antigens, we tracked the origin and followed the differentiation paths of MBCs in the early anti-S response to mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-na\u0026iumlve individuals on single-cell and monoclonal antibody level. Newly generated and pre-existing MBCs differed in their differentiation paths despite similar levels of SARS-CoV-2 and common corona virus S-reactivity. Pre-existing highly mutated MBCs showed no signs of germinal center re-entry and rapidly developed into mature antibody secreting cells (ASCs). In contrast, newly generated MBCs derived from na\u0026iumlve precursors showed strong signs of antibody affinity maturation before differentiating into ASCs. Thus, although pre-existing human MBCs have an intrinsic propensity to differentiate into ASCs, the quality of the anti-S antibody and MBC response improved through the clonal selection and affinity maturation of na\u0026iumlve precursors.\nEpithelial organoid supports resident memory CD8 T cell differentiation\nAuthors: Ulibarri, M.; Lin, Y.; Ramprashad, J. R.; Han, G.; Hasan, M. H.; Mithila, F. J.; Ma, C.; Gopinath, S.; Zhang, N.; Milner, J. J.; Beura, L.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569395\nResident Memory T cells (TRM) play a vital role in regional immune defense in barrier organs. Although laboratory rodents have been extensively used to study fundamental TRM biology, poor isolation efficiency, sampling bias and low cell survival rates have limited our ability to conduct TRM-focused high-throughput assays. Here, we engineered a murine vaginal epithelial organoid (VEO)-CD8 T cell co-culture system that supports CD8 TRM differentiation in vitro. The three-dimensional VEOs established from murine adult stem cells resembled stratified squamous vaginal epithelium and induced gradual differentiation of activated CD8 T cells into epithelial TRM. These in vitro generated TRM were phenotypically and transcriptionally similar to in vivo TRM, and key tissue residency features were reinforced with a second cognate-antigen exposure during co-culture. TRM differentiation was not affected even when VEOs and CD8 T cells were separated by a semipermeable barrier, indicating soluble factors involvement. Pharmacological and genetic approaches showed that TGF-{beta} signaling played a crucial role in their differentiation. We found that the VEOs in our model remained susceptible to viral infections and the CD8 T cells were amenable to genetic manipulation; both of which will allow detailed interrogation of antiviral CD8 T cell biology in a reductionist setting. In summary, we established a robust model which captures bonafide TRM differentiation that is scalable, open to iterative sampling, and can be subjected to high throughput assays that will rapidly add to our understanding of TRM.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-Co-V-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,764-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune imprinting - also known as  original antigenic sin - describes how the first exposure to a virus shapes the immunological outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron breakthrough infections and bivalent COVID-19 vaccination were shown to primarily recall cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior mRNA vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike rather than priming naive B cells that recognize Omicron-specific epitopes. These findings underscored a strong immune imprinting resulting from repeated Wuhan-Hu-1 spike exposures. To understand if immune imprinting can be overcome, we investigated memory and plasma antibody responses after administration of the updated XBB.1.5 COVID mRNA vaccine booster. Our data show that the XBB.1.5 booster elicits neutralizing antibody responses against current variants that are dominated by recall of pre-existing memory B cells previously induced by the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These results indicate that immune imprinting persists even after multiple exposures to Omicron spikes through vaccination and infection, including post XBB.1.5 spike booster mRNA vaccination, which will need to be considered to guide the design of future vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammation is a biological phenomenon involved in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although a controlled inflammatory response is beneficial for restoring homeostasis, it can become unfavorable if dysregulated. In recent years, major progress has been made in characterizing acute and chronic inflammation in specific diseases. However, a global, holistic understanding of inflammation is still elusive. This is particularly intriguing, considering the crucial function of inflammation for human health and its potential for modern medicine if fully deciphered. Here, we leverage advances in the field of single-cell genomics to delineate the full spectrum of circulating immune cell activation underlying inflammatory processes during infection, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our single-cell atlas of &gt;2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 356 patients and 18 diseases allowed us to learn a foundation model of inflammation in circulating immune cells. The atlas expanded our current knowledge of the biology of inflammation of acute (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis) and chronic (e.g. cirrhosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) disease processes and laid the foundation to develop a precision medicine framework using unsupervised as well as explainable machine learning. Beyond a disease-centered classification, we charted altered activity of inflammatory molecules in peripheral blood cells, depicting functional biomarkers to further understand mechanisms of inflammation. Finally, we have laid the groundwork for developing precision medicine diagnostic tools for patients experiencing severe acute or chronic inflammation by learning a classifier for inflammatory diseases, presenting cells in circulation as a powerful resource for patient stratification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L452R&#43;F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L455F&#43;F456L&#43;A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their temporarily unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains could survive and transmit at low levels, since their large antigenic distance to dominant strains allow them to target distinct populations and accumulate immune-evasive mutations rapidly, often at the cost of receptor binding affinity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogen encounter results in long-lasting epigenetic imprinting that shapes diseases caused by heterologous pathogens. The breadth of this innate immune memory is of particular interest in the context of respiratory pathogens with increased pandemic potential and wide-ranging impact on global health. Here, we investigated epigenetic imprinting across cell lineages in a disease relevant murine model of SARS-CoV-2 recovery. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in increased chromatin accessibility of type I interferon (IFN-I) related transcription factors in airway-resident macrophages. Mechanistically, establishment of this innate immune memory required viral pattern recognition and canonical IFN-I signaling and augmented secondary antiviral responses. Past SARS-CoV-2 infection ameliorated disease caused by the heterologous respiratory pathogen influenza A virus. Insights into innate immune memory and how it affects subsequent infections with heterologous pathogens to influence disease pathology could facilitate the development of broadly effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a global threat, and current vaccines, while effective against severe illness, fall short in preventing transmission. To address this challenge, theres a need for vaccines that induce mucosal immunity and can rapidly control the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that a single immunization with a novel gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine (GRAd) carrying the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein (S-2P) in non-human primates provided protective immunity for over one year against the BA.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2. A prime-boost regimen using GRAd followed by adjuvanted S-2P (GRAd&#43;S-2P) accelerated viral clearance in both the lower and upper airways. GRAd delivered via aerosol (GRAd(AE)&#43;S-2P) modestly improved protection compared to its matched intramuscular regimen, but showed dramatically superior boosting by mRNA and, importantly, total virus clearance in the upper airway by day 4 post infection. GrAd vaccination regimens elicited robust and durable systemic and mucosal antibody responses to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, but only GRAd(AE)&#43;S-2P generated long-lasting T cell responses in the lung. This research underscores the flexibility of the GRAd vaccine platform to provide durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in both the lower and upper airways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular phenotype and function are altered in different microenvironments. For targeted therapies it is important to understand site-specific cellular adaptations. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is characterised by joint inflammation, with frequent inadequate treatment responses. To comprehensively assess the inflammatory immune landscape, we designed a 37-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel delineating mononuclear cells from JIA synovial fluid (SF), compared to JIA and healthy control blood. Synovial monocytes and NK cells lack the Fc-receptor CD16, suggesting antibody-mediated targeting may be ineffective. B cells and DCs, both in small frequencies in SF, undergo maturation with high 4-1BB, CD71, CD39 expression, supporting T cell activation. SF effector and regulatory T cells were highly active with newly described co-receptor combinations that may alter function, and suggestion of metabolic reprogramming via CD71, TNFR2 and PD-1. Most SF effector phenotypes, as well as an identified CD4-Foxp3&#43; T cell population, were restricted to the inflamed joint, yet specific SF-predominant Treg (CD4&#43;Foxp3&#43;) subpopulations were increased in blood of active but not inactive JIA, suggesting possible recirculation and loss of immunoregulation at distal sites. This first comprehensive dataset of the site-specific inflammatory landscape at protein level will inform functional studies and the development of targeted therapeutics to restore immunoregulatory balance and achieve remission in JIA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long-lived immunoglobulin (Ig) E responses against innocuous environmental and dietary antigens (Ags) are maintained by an IgG1-dominant memory B cell (MBC) compartment primed for IL-4 responsiveness. In this work, we investigated the plasticity of the MBC compartment fated for IgE class switch recombination upon Ag re-exposure. Antibody-mediated IL-4R( blockade augmented the germinal center response and uncovered an IL-4/IL-13 dependency within the type 2 memory B cell (MBC2) skewed phenotype. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling during the recall response, a long-lived Ag-specific IgG2c MBC population emerged, shifting the MBC response away from a type 2 phenotype and towards type 1. The emergence of this IgG2c response was dependent on IFN-( signaling and arose from both unswitched and class-switched Ag-specific B cells in vivo. We further demonstrated that a type 1-polarizing adjuvant can augment the redirection of type 2-polarized class-switched MBCs, suggesting with the correct cues pathogenic MBCs can be functionally reprogrammed.

One Sentence SummaryB cell responses to allergens can be reprogrammed away from a pathogenic fate through IL-4/IL-13 signaling blockade.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Memory B cells (MBCs) formed over the individual&#39;s lifetime constitute nearly half of the adult peripheral blood B cell repertoire in humans. To assess their response to novel antigens, we tracked the origin and followed the differentiation paths of MBCs in the early anti-S response to mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-na&amp;iumlve individuals on single-cell and monoclonal antibody level. Newly generated and pre-existing MBCs differed in their differentiation paths despite similar levels of SARS-CoV-2 and common corona virus S-reactivity. Pre-existing highly mutated MBCs showed no signs of germinal center re-entry and rapidly developed into mature antibody secreting cells (ASCs). In contrast, newly generated MBCs derived from na&amp;iumlve precursors showed strong signs of antibody affinity maturation before differentiating into ASCs. Thus, although pre-existing human MBCs have an intrinsic propensity to differentiate into ASCs, the quality of the anti-S antibody and MBC response improved through the clonal selection and affinity maturation of na&amp;iumlve precursors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resident Memory T cells (TRM) play a vital role in regional immune defense in barrier organs. Although laboratory rodents have been extensively used to study fundamental TRM biology, poor isolation efficiency, sampling bias and low cell survival rates have limited our ability to conduct TRM-focused high-throughput assays. Here, we engineered a murine vaginal epithelial organoid (VEO)-CD8 T cell co-culture system that supports CD8 TRM differentiation in vitro. The three-dimensional VEOs established from murine adult stem cells resembled stratified squamous vaginal epithelium and induced gradual differentiation of activated CD8 T cells into epithelial TRM. These in vitro generated TRM were phenotypically and transcriptionally similar to in vivo TRM, and key tissue residency features were reinforced with a second cognate-antigen exposure during co-culture. TRM differentiation was not affected even when VEOs and CD8 T cells were separated by a semipermeable barrier, indicating soluble factors involvement. Pharmacological and genetic approaches showed that TGF-{beta} signaling played a crucial role in their differentiation. We found that the VEOs in our model remained susceptible to viral infections and the CD8 T cells were amenable to genetic manipulation; both of which will allow detailed interrogation of antiviral CD8 T cell biology in a reductionist setting. In summary, we established a robust model which captures bonafide TRM differentiation that is scalable, open to iterative sampling, and can be subjected to high throughput assays that will rapidly add to our understanding of TRM.</p>
