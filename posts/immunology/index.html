A.\nScore: 64.9, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547255\nIgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo. One-Sentence SummaryEndothelial cells remodel IgG glycans within the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway.\nSingle-cell transcriptomic analysis of NK cell dynamics in myeloma patients reveal persistent reduction of cytotoxic NK cells from diagnosis to relapse\nAuthors: Tahri, S.; de Jong, M. M. E.; Fokkema, C.; Papazian, N.; Kellermayer, Z.; Vermeulen, M.; Van Duin, M.; Van Beek, G.; Hoogenboezem, R.; Van De Woestijne, P.; Nasserinejad, K.; Saraci, E.; D'Agostino, M.; Gay, F.; Van Der Velden, V.; Sanders, M.; Zweegman, S.; Van De Donk, N.; Broijl, A.; Sonneveld, P.; Cupedo, T.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547295\nNatural killer (NK) cells mediate the cytotoxic immune response against multiple myeloma and are important effector cells in immune therapies through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry and functional assays to investigate the bone marrow NK cell compartment of myeloma patients at diagnosis, during treatment and after relapse. The bone marrow of myeloma patients is characterized by a reduction in conventional cytotoxic NK cells that persists throughout treatment. We show in 20% of newly diagnosed myeloma patients that an altered balance between cytotoxic and cytokine-producing NK cells translates into a reduced cytotoxic ability in response to therapeutic antibodies. The relative loss of cytotoxic NK cells persists at relapse and is accompanied by an expansion of IFN-responsive NK cells. These findings reveal previously unappreciated alterations in bone marrow NK cell composition and highlight the importance of understanding the bone marrow immune system in patients receiving immunotherapies. Statement of significanceThe bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients is characterized by a persistent reduction in cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells, accompanied by inferior in vitro responses to therapeutic antibodies at diagnosis and an increase in IFN-responsive NK cells at relapse. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the BM microenvironment in multiple myeloma patients receiving immunotherapies.\nProlonged T cell - DC macro-clustering within lymph node microenvironments initiates Th2 cell differentiation in a site specific manner\nAuthors: Lyons-Cohen, M. R.; Shamskhou, E.; Gerner, M. Y.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547554\nFormation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent 'macro-clustering' at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.\nSingle-cell analysis of signalling and transcriptional responses to type I interferons\nAuthors: Rigby, R. E.; Rue-Albrecht, K.; Sims, D.; Rehwinkel, J.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547491\nType I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varied between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.

As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1+E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.\nProteome profiling of nasopharynx reveals pathophysiological signature of COVID-19 disease severity\nAuthors: Ooi, A.; Esau, L.

J.; Hala, S.; Pain, A.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.09.548285\nAn aberrant innate immune system caused by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a characteristic manifestation of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we performed proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 273 hospitalized patients with mild and severe COVID-19 symptoms, including non-survivors. We identified depletion in STAT1-mediated type I interferon response, retinol metabolism and NRF2 antioxidant system that are associated with disease severity in our patient demography. We found that the dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 fatality. Hyperactivation of host innate immune system was observed in severe patients, marked by elevated proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and platelet aggregation. Our study using high-throughput proteomics on the nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients provides additional evidence on the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiological signatures of disease severity and fatality.\nMechanistic basis for nigericin-induced NLRP1 inflammasome activation in human epithelial cells\nAuthors: Zhong, F. L.; Rozario, P.; Pinilla, M.; Vind, A. C.; Robinson, K.; Gee Ann, T.; Jasrie Firdaus, M.; Francisco Martinez, J.; Zhewang, L.; Bekker-Jensen, S.; Meunier, E.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546021\nNigericin, an ionophore derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, is arguably the most commonly used tool compound to study the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent findings, however, showed that nigericin also activates the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes. In this study, we resolve the mechanistic basis of nigericin-driven NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In multiple non-hematopoietic cell types, nigericin rapidly and specifically inhibits the elongation stage of the ribosome cycle by depleting cytosolic potassium ions. This activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor kinase ZAK[a], p38 and JNK, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of the NLRP1 linker domain. As a result, nigericin-induced pyroptosis in human keratinocytes is blocked by extracellular potassium supplementation, ZAK[a] knockout or pharmacologic inhibitors of ZAK[a] and p38 kinase activities. By surveying a diverse panel of ionophores, we show that the electroneutrality of potassium efflux is essential to activate ZAK[a]-driven RSR, likely because a greater extent of K+ depletion is necessary to activate ZAK[a]-NLRP1 than NLRP3. These findings resolve the mechanism by which nigericin activates NLRP1 in nonhematopoietic cell types and demonstrate an unexpected connection between RSR, perturbations of potassium ion flux and innate immunity.

It has enabled numerous breakthroughs in the field linking NLRP3 activation to potassium efflux. In this manuscript, we report that nigericin activates an alternate inflammasome sensor, NLRP1 in primary human skin, nasal and corneal epithelial cells. NLRP1 activation by nigericin requires K+ efflux-driven ribosome stalling and the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor MAP3K, ZAK[a]. We further identify the key biophysical principles that explain why only a subset of K+ ionophores, exemplified by nigericin, function as super inflammasome agonists that can activate either NLRP1 or NLRP3, depending on cell type. These results reveal an unexpected connection between RSR, potassium ion flux and innate immunity.\nNeuron-dependent tuft cell expansion initiates sinonasal allergic Type 2 inflammation\nAuthors: Ortiz-Carpena, J.

R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547596\nIt is unknown whether interactions between tuft cells and trigeminal sinonasal neurons contribute to allergic disease. Intranasal administration of house dust mite or fungal allergens induced tuft cell expansion, eosinophilia, sneezing, Type 2 responses, and neuropeptide release. Mice lacking tuft cells lost these responses but retained eosinophilia and elevated neuropeptides. Ablation of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)+ neurons prevented allergen-evoked tuft cell expansion and eosinophilia without affecting ILC2 and TH2 cell recruitment. Exposure of naive TG neurons to allergen evoked calcium influx and neuropeptide release, but only Substance P (SP) adaptively increased upon repetitive allergen exposure. SP instructed tuft cell lineage commitment and initiated allergic inflammation. Ablation or inhibition of the SP receptor, neurokinin 1, reversed allergen-induced sneezing, tuft cell expansion, and eosinophilia. We propose that sinonasal nociceptors detect protease-containing allergens and adaptively secrete SP to drive tuft cell expansion and early features of Type 2 immunity.

Herein, we demonstrate that sensory nerves adaptively sense fungal allergens and communicate with the adjacent sinonasal respiratory epithelium to direct transformation of basal cells into sinonasal tuft cells (STC), which secrete mediators that initiate early allergic Type 2 inflammation, including the expansion of sinonasal tissue-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and eosinophilia. SP is a strong candidate mediator, and the effect of SP-mediated signaling on sneezing behavior suggests that a positive feedback loop may be established between resident sensory nerves and nearby STCs, which is further potentiated with chronic fungal allergen exposure. These findings may pave the way for future therapeutic avenues for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) that target the early stages of the disease and hopefully improve patient quality of life.

A.; Morejon, B.; Saab, S. A.; Metto, E. M.; Li, M.; Osta, M.; An, C.; Culbertson, C. T.; Scoglio, C. M.; Michel, K.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.545904\nInsect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.\nImmune-Epithelial Dynamics and Tissue Remodeling in Chronically Inflamed Nasal Epithelium via Multi-scaled Transcriptomics\nAuthors: Liao, G.; Nakayama, T.; Lee, I.

V.; Jiang, S.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547352\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The complex pathophysiology of CRS remains poorly understood, with emerging evidence implicating the orchestration between diverse immune and epithelial cell types in disease progression. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to both dissociated and intact, freshly isolated sinonasal human tissues to investigate the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of CRS with and without nasal polyp formation compared to non-CRS control samples. Our findings reveal a mechanism for macrophage-eosinophil recruitment into the nasal mucosa, systematic dysregulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and enrichment of mast cell populations to the upper airway tissues with intricate interactions between mast cells and CD4 T cells. Additionally, we identify immune-epithelial interactions and dysregulation, particularly involving understudied basal progenitor cells and Tuft chemosensory cells. We further describe a distinct basal cell differential trajectory in CRS patients with nasal polyps (NP), and link it to NP formation through immune-epithelial remodeling. By harnessing stringent patient tissue selection and advanced technologies, our study unveils novel aspects of CRS pathophysiology, and sheds light onto both intricate immune and epithelial cell interactions within the disrupted CRS tissue microenvironment and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings expand upon existing knowledge of nasal inflammation and provide a comprehensive resource towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this uniquely complex disease entity, and beyond.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells mediate the cytotoxic immune response against multiple myeloma and are important effector cells in immune therapies through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry and functional assays to investigate the bone marrow NK cell compartment of myeloma patients at diagnosis, during treatment and after relapse. The bone marrow of myeloma patients is characterized by a reduction in conventional cytotoxic NK cells that persists throughout treatment. We show in 20% of newly diagnosed myeloma patients that an altered balance between cytotoxic and cytokine-producing NK cells translates into a reduced cytotoxic ability in response to therapeutic antibodies. The relative loss of cytotoxic NK cells persists at relapse and is accompanied by an expansion of IFN-responsive NK cells. These findings reveal previously unappreciated alterations in bone marrow NK cell composition and highlight the importance of understanding the bone marrow immune system in patients receiving immunotherapies.

Statement of significanceThe bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients is characterized by a persistent reduction in cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells, accompanied by inferior in vitro responses to therapeutic antibodies at diagnosis and an increase in IFN-responsive NK cells at relapse. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the BM microenvironment in multiple myeloma patients receiving immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Formation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent &#39;macro-clustering&#39; at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varied between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.

In briefRigby et al. provide a single-cell map of signalling and transcriptomic responses to type I IFNs in ex vivo stimulated human PBMCs. Different cell types responded in unique ways but differences between different type I IFNs were only quantitative. These rich datasets are available via an easy-to-use interactive interface (https://rehwinkellab.shinyapps.io/ifnresource/).

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has developed substantial antigenic variability. As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1&#43;E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An aberrant innate immune system caused by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a characteristic manifestation of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we performed proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 273 hospitalized patients with mild and severe COVID-19 symptoms, including non-survivors. We identified depletion in STAT1-mediated type I interferon response, retinol metabolism and NRF2 antioxidant system that are associated with disease severity in our patient demography. We found that the dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 fatality. Hyperactivation of host innate immune system was observed in severe patients, marked by elevated proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and platelet aggregation. Our study using high-throughput proteomics on the nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients provides additional evidence on the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiological signatures of disease severity and fatality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nigericin, an ionophore derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, is arguably the most commonly used tool compound to study the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent findings, however, showed that nigericin also activates the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes. In this study, we resolve the mechanistic basis of nigericin-driven NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In multiple non-hematopoietic cell types, nigericin rapidly and specifically inhibits the elongation stage of the ribosome cycle by depleting cytosolic potassium ions. This activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor kinase ZAK[a], p38 and JNK, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of the NLRP1 linker domain. As a result, nigericin-induced pyroptosis in human keratinocytes is blocked by extracellular potassium supplementation, ZAK[a] knockout or pharmacologic inhibitors of ZAK[a] and p38 kinase activities. By surveying a diverse panel of ionophores, we show that the electroneutrality of potassium efflux is essential to activate ZAK[a]-driven RSR, likely because a greater extent of K&#43; depletion is necessary to activate ZAK[a]-NLRP1 than NLRP3. These findings resolve the mechanism by which nigericin activates NLRP1 in nonhematopoietic cell types and demonstrate an unexpected connection between RSR, perturbations of potassium ion flux and innate immunity.

It has enabled numerous breakthroughs in the field linking NLRP3 activation to potassium efflux. In this manuscript, we report that nigericin activates an alternate inflammasome sensor, NLRP1 in primary human skin, nasal and corneal epithelial cells. NLRP1 activation by nigericin requires K&#43; efflux-driven ribosome stalling and the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor MAP3K, ZAK[a]. We further identify the key biophysical principles that explain why only a subset of K&#43; ionophores, exemplified by nigericin, function as  super inflammasome agonists that can activate either NLRP1 or NLRP3, depending on cell type. These results reveal an unexpected connection between RSR, potassium ion flux and innate immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is unknown whether interactions between tuft cells and trigeminal sinonasal neurons contribute to allergic disease. Intranasal administration of house dust mite or fungal allergens induced tuft cell expansion, eosinophilia, sneezing, Type 2 responses, and neuropeptide release. Mice lacking tuft cells lost these responses but retained eosinophilia and elevated neuropeptides. Ablation of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)&#43; neurons prevented allergen-evoked tuft cell expansion and eosinophilia without affecting ILC2 and TH2 cell recruitment. Exposure of naive TG neurons to allergen evoked calcium influx and neuropeptide release, but only Substance P (SP) adaptively increased upon repetitive allergen exposure. SP instructed tuft cell lineage commitment and initiated allergic inflammation. Ablation or inhibition of the SP receptor, neurokinin 1, reversed allergen-induced sneezing, tuft cell expansion, and eosinophilia. We propose that sinonasal nociceptors detect protease-containing allergens and adaptively secrete SP to drive tuft cell expansion and early features of Type 2 immunity.

Herein, we demonstrate that sensory nerves adaptively sense fungal allergens and communicate with the adjacent sinonasal respiratory epithelium to direct transformation of basal cells into sinonasal tuft cells (STC), which secrete mediators that initiate early allergic Type 2 inflammation, including the expansion of sinonasal tissue-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and eosinophilia. SP is a strong candidate mediator, and the effect of SP-mediated signaling on sneezing behavior suggests that a positive feedback loop may be established between resident sensory nerves and nearby STCs, which is further potentiated with chronic fungal allergen exposure. These findings may pave the way for future therapeutic avenues for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) that target the early stages of the disease and hopefully improve patient quality of life.

        <p class="abstract">Insect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The complex pathophysiology of CRS remains poorly understood, with emerging evidence implicating the orchestration between diverse immune and epithelial cell types in disease progression. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to both dissociated and intact, freshly isolated sinonasal human tissues to investigate the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of CRS with and without nasal polyp formation compared to non-CRS control samples. Our findings reveal a mechanism for macrophage-eosinophil recruitment into the nasal mucosa, systematic dysregulation of CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, and enrichment of mast cell populations to the upper airway tissues with intricate interactions between mast cells and CD4 T cells. Additionally, we identify immune-epithelial interactions and dysregulation, particularly involving understudied basal progenitor cells and Tuft chemosensory cells. We further describe a distinct basal cell differential trajectory in CRS patients with nasal polyps (NP), and link it to NP formation through immune-epithelial remodeling. By harnessing stringent patient tissue selection and advanced technologies, our study unveils novel aspects of CRS pathophysiology, and sheds light onto both intricate immune and epithelial cell interactions within the disrupted CRS tissue microenvironment and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings expand upon existing knowledge of nasal inflammation and provide a comprehensive resource towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this uniquely complex disease entity, and beyond.</p>
