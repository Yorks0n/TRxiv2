R.; Singer, M.; Quadiri, A.; Zayou, L.; Vahed, H.; Coulon, P.-G.; El Babsiri, A.; Gil, D.; Ulmer, J. B.; BENMOHAMED, L.\nScore: 34.4, Published: 2024-02-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.14.580225\nThe first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines have successfully contributed to reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious illness, and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, waning immunity induced by these vaccines failed to prevent immune escape by many variants of concern (VOCs) that emerged from 2020 to 2024, resulting in a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that a next-generation Coronavirus (CoV) vaccine incorporating highly conserved non-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antigens would confer stronger and broader cross-protective immunity against multiple VOCs. In the present study, we identified ten non-Spike antigens that are highly conserved in 8.7 million SARS-CoV-2 strains, twenty-one VOCs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Common Cold CoVs, and animal CoVs. Seven of the 10 antigens were preferentially recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from unvaccinated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, irrespective of VOC infection. Three out of the seven conserved non-Spike T cell antigens belong to the early expressed Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC) region, when administered to the golden Syrian hamsters, in combination with Spike, as nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (i.e., combined mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine): (i) Induced high frequencies of lung-resident antigen-specific CXCR5+CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells, GzmB+CD4+ and GzmB+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (TCYT), and CD69+IFN-{gamma}+TNF+CD4+ and CD69+IFN-{gamma}+TNF+CD8+ effector T cells (TEFF); and (ii) Reduced viral load and COVID-19-like symptoms caused by various VOCs, including the highly pathogenic B.1.617.2 Delta variant and the highly transmittable heavily Spike-mutated XBB1.5 Omicron sub-variant. The combined mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine could be rapidly adapted for clinical use to confer broader cross-protective immunity against emerging highly mutated and pathogenic VOCs. IMPORTANCEAs of January 2024, over 1500 individuals in the United States alone are still dying from COVID-19 each week despite the implementation of first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines. The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as the currently circulating highly mutated BA.2.86 and JN.1 Omicron sub-variants, constantly overrode immunity induced by the first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines. Here we report a next generation broad spectrum combined multi-antigen mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine that consists of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) that delivers three highly conserved non-Spike viral T cell protein antigens together with the Spike protein B-cell antigen. Compared side-by-side to the clinically proven first-generation Spike-alone mRNA/LNP-based vaccine, the combined multi-antigen mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine-induced higher frequencies of lung-resident non-Spike antigen-specific T follicular helper (TFH) cells, cytotoxic T cells (TCYT), effector T cells (TEFF) and Spike specific-neutralizing antibodies. This was associated to a potent cross-reactive protection against various VOCs, including the highly pathogenic Delta variant and the highly transmittable heavily Spike-mutated Omicron sub-variants. Our findings suggest an alternative broad-spectrum pan-Coronavirus vaccine capable of (i) disrupting the current COVID-19 booster paradigm; (ii) outpacing the bivalent variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines; and (iii) ending an apparent prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpatial transcriptomics reveals focal induction of molecular responses and cellular interactions in the small intestine during Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection.\nAuthors: Campillo Poveda, M.; Laidlaw, R. F.; Hardy, O.; Otto, T. D.; Maizels, R. M.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579622\nThe infective L3 larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus migrate to the small intestine where they take up residence in the submucosa, triggering the formation of complex granulomas around the parasite. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the transcriptional intricacies and cell-cell interactions of the murine small intestine under both steady-state conditions and in response to H. polygyrus infection. Our findings unveil distinct transcriptional signatures in the crypt zone, villi, and granulomas, providing nuanced insights into the molecular dynamics of the host response to parasitic infection. Molecular characterization of H. polygyrus granulomas reveals unique cellular compositions within distinct clusters, shedding light on localized immune activation and cellular dynamics. Utilizing deconvolution techniques, we uncovered common and infection-specific signatures of cell type colocalization, and identified potential ligand-receptor pairs that may mediate communication between the granuloma tissue and the epithelial crypt cells. Additionally, our study highlights the upregulation of genes such as Ccl9, Fcer1g and Tmsb4x within granulomas, suggesting roles in type 2 inflammation, and genes (e.g Reg3b and Mxra7) associated with wound healing and tissue repair. These results not only enhance our understanding of the murine small intestines transcriptional landscape but also provide a platform for exploring host-pathogen interactions. The comprehensive analysis presented here contributes to a holistic comprehension of tissue-specific responses during parasitic infections, offering valuable insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.\nXBB.1.5 monovalent booster improves antibody binding and neutralization against emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants\nAuthors: Jain, S.; Kumar, S.; Lai, L.; Linderman, S.; Malik, A. A.; Ellis, M. L.; Godbole, S.; Solis, D.; Sahoo, M. K.; Bechnak, K.; Paredes, I.; Tanios, R.; Kazzi, B.; Dib, S. M.; Litvack, M. B.; Wimalsena, S. T.; Ciric, C.; Rostad, C.; West, R.; Teng, I.-T.; Wang, D.; Kwong, P. D.; Rouphael, N.; Pinsky, B. A.; Douek, D. C.; Wrammert, J.; Moreno, A.; Suthar, M. S.\nScore: 70.9, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.578771\nThe rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.\nIL-17C plays a role in the pathophysiology of acute recurrent tonsillitis\nAuthors: Clapperton, M.; Kunanandam, T.; Florea, C. D.; Cunningham, M. R.; Douglas, C.; McConnell, G.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.578879\nMost tonsillectomies in the UK are performed to treat acute recurrent tonsillitis (ART) and tonsil hypertrophy due to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). At present, the pathophysiology of these 2 common conditions is still poorly understood. We have performed optical mesoscopic imaging to reveal the spatial location of two interleukins - IL-17C and IL-1{beta} - associated with tonsillar conditions, with the aim of understanding their possible role as specific disease biomarkers. Using immunofluorescence assays, we have shown that the expression of IL-17C is significantly higher in both the epithelial tissue (p \u003c 0.0001) and core tissues (p = 0.0007) of specimens from patients with ART compared to patients with OSA (n = 17 patients). We also demonstrated significantly higher expression of IL-17C in homogenates of ART patient tissue compared to OSA tissue (p = 0.05). These data suggest that IL-17C may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ART, and may be a potential biomarker of disease.\nNF-κB Signaling is Required for X-Chromosome Inactivation Maintenance Following T cell Activation\nAuthors: Forsyth, K. S.; Toothacre, N. E.; Jiwarjka, N.; Driscoll, A. M.; Shallberg, L. A.; Cunningham-Rundles, C.; Barmettler, S.; Farmer, J. R.; Verbsky, J.; Routes, J.; Beiting, D. P.; Romberg, N.; May, M. J.; Anguera, M.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579505\nX Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process which balances X-linked gene dosage between sexes. Unstimulated T cells lack cytological enrichment of Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), and these modifications become enriched at the Xi after cell stimulation. Here, we examined allele-specific gene expression and the epigenomic profiles of the Xi following T cell stimulation. We found that the Xi in unstimulated T cells is largely dosage compensated and is enriched with the repressive H3K27me3 modification, but not the H2AK119-ubiquitin (Ub) mark, even at promoters of XCI escape genes. Upon CD3/CD28-mediated T cell stimulation, the Xi accumulates H2AK119-Ub and H3K27me3 across the Xi. Next, we examined the T cell signaling pathways responsible for Xist RNA localization to the Xi and found that T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, specifically NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of TCR, is required. Disruption of NF-{kappa}B signaling, using inhibitors or genetic deletions, in mice and patients with immunodeficiencies prevents Xist/XIST RNA accumulation at the Xi and alters expression of some X-linked genes. Our findings reveal a novel connection between NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways which impact XCI maintenance in female T cells.\nNeutrophils in People Living With HIV-1 on antiretroviral treatment conserve their cytokine and chemokine secretion capacity and display enhanced expression of Fc receptors\nAuthors: Marsile-Medun, S.; Souchard, M.; Abba Moussa, D.; Lorin, V.; Mouquet, H.; Reynaud, E.; Dibsy, R.; TUAILLON, E.; MURIAUX, D.; Pugniere, M.; Ngo, G.; Naranjo-Gomez, M.; Pelegrin, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-02-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.13.580065\nNeutrophils are innate immune cells that display immunomodulatory properties by secreting cytokines and chemokines. By using a mouse model of retroviral infection, we previously uncovered the key immunomodulatory function of neutrophils in promoting protective immunity during antiviral antibody therapy which occurs in a Fc-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils in the context of HIV-1 infection and therapy. We characterized the functional activation and the modulation of Fc{gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs) expression on neutrophils isolated from healthy donors (HD) or people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) upon stimulation with virions, free or in the form of immune complexes (ICs) made with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Neutrophils from HD secreted cytokines/chemokines in small amount upon activation by either stimulus. Interestingly, conditioning of neutrophils from HD with pro-inflammatory cytokines enhanced their cytokine/chemokine production upon activation by HIV-1 and ICs, highlighting that the inflammatory environment is key for neutrophils to show a functional response to these stimuli. Noteworthy, under inflammatory conditions, IC-activated neutrophils showed higher secretion of CXCL1 and CCL4 than HIV-1-stimulated neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophils from PLWH on antiretroviral treatment (ART) maintained their cytokine/chemokine secretion abilities when stimulated by TLR agonists, TNF; or HIV-1/ICs. However, they displayed different phenotypic features as compared with neutrophils isolated from HD, notably higher expression of Fc{gamma}Rs. Our study provides new insights into the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils during HIV-1 infection and therapy. This might contribute to the improvement of antiviral antibody therapies through the use of therapeutic approaches exploiting the immunomodulatory properties of these cells.\nStreptavidin-drug conjugates streamline optimization of antibody-based conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\nAuthors: Yelamali, A. R.; Chendamarai, E.; Ritchey, J. K.; Rettig, M. P.; DiPersio, J. F.; Persaud, S. P.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.579199\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) conditioning using antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) is a promising alternative to conventional chemotherapy- and irradiation-based conditioning regimens. The drug payload bound to an ADC is a key contributor to its efficacy and potential toxicities; however, a comparison of HSCT conditioning ADCs produced with different toxic payloads has not been performed. Indeed, ADC optimization studies in general are hampered by the inability to produce and screen multiple combinations of antibody and drug payload in a rapid, cost-effective manner. Herein, we used Click chemistry to covalently conjugate four different small molecule payloads to streptavidin; these streptavidin-drug conjugates can then be joined to any biotinylated antibody to produce stable, indirectly conjugated ADCs. Evaluating CD45-targeted ADCs produced with this system, we found the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer SGD-1882 was the most effective payload for targeting mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and acute myeloid leukemia cells. In murine syngeneic HSCT studies, a single dose of CD45-PBD enabled near-complete conversion to donor hematopoiesis. Finally, human CD45-PBD provided significant antitumor benefit in a patient-derived xenograft model of acute myeloid leukemia. As our streptavidin-drug conjugates were generated in-house with readily accessible equipment, reagents, and routine molecular biology techniques, we anticipate this flexible platform will facilitate the evaluation and optimization of ADCs for myriad targeting applications.\nMitochondrial Transplantation promotes protective effector and memory CD4+ T cell response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and diminishes exhaustion and senescence in elderly CD4+ T cells\nAuthors: Headley, C. A.; Guatam, s.; Olmo-Fontanez, A. M.; Garcia-Vilanova, A.; Dwivedi, V.; Schami, A. A.; Weintraub, S.; Tsao, P. S.; Torrelles, J. B.; Turner, J.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577036\nTuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), remains a significant health concern worldwide, especially in populations with weakened or compromised immune systems, such as the elderly. Proper adaptive immune function, particularly a CD4+ T cell response, is central to host immunity against M.tb. Chronic infections, such as M.tb, as well as aging promote T cell exhaustion and senescence, which can impair immune control and promote progression to TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T cell dysfunction, both in aging and chronic infections and diseases. Mitochondrial perturbations can disrupt cellular metabolism, enhance oxidative stress, and impair T-cell signaling and effector functions. This study examined the impact of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function using aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Our study revealed that mito-transfer in naive CD4+ T cells promoted the generation of protective effector and memory CD4+ T cells during M.tb infection in mice. Further, mito-transfer enhanced the function of elderly human T cells by increasing their mitochondrial mass and modulating cytokine production, which in turn reduced exhaustion and senescence cell markers. Our results suggest that mito-transfer could be a novel strategy to reestablish aged CD4+ T cell function, potentially improving immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients, with a broader implication for other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to T cell exhaustion and senescence.\nPINK1 is a target of T cell responses in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Williams, G. P.; Michaelis, T.; Rodrigues Lima-Junior, J.; Frazier, A.; Tran, N. K.; Phillips, E. J.; Mallal, S. A.; Litvan, I.; Goldman, J. G.; Alcalay, R. N.; Sidney, J.; Sulzer, D.; Sette, A.; Lindestam Arlehamn, C. S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579465\nParkinsons disease (PD) is associated with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein alpha-synuclein in a subset of individuals. Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN{gamma}, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.\nRational Design of Monomeric IL37 Variants Guided by Stability and Dynamical Analyses of IL37 Dimers\nAuthors: Sardag, I.; Duvenci, Z. S.; Belkaya, S.; Timucin, E.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579100\nIL37 plays important roles in the regulation of innate immunity and its oligomeric status is critical to these roles. In its monomeric state, IL37 can effectively inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by IL18 through binding to the IL18 receptor , a capability lost in its dimeric form. This paradigm underscores the pivotal role of IL37s dimer structure in the design of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hitherto, two IL37 dimer structures were deposited in PDB, reflecting the potential use of their binding interface in the design of IL37 variants with altered dimerization tendencies. Inspection of these static structures suggested a substantial difference in their dimer interfaces. Prompted by this discrepancy, we analyzed the PDB structures of IL37 dimer (PDB: 6ncu and 5hn1) along with a predicted structure by AF2-multimer by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel whether and how IL37 can form homodimers through distinct interfaces. Results showed that the 5hn1 and AF2 dimers, which shared the same interface, stably maintained their initial conformations throughout the simulations whilst the recent IL37 dimer (PDB ID: 6ncu) with a different interface, did not. These findings underscored that the recent IL37 dimer (6ncu) structure is likely to contain an error, probably in its biological assembly record, otherwise it was not a stable assembly in silico. Next, focusing on the stable dimer structure of 5hn1, we have identified five critical positions of V71/Y85/I86/E89/S114 that would altogether reduce dimer stability without affecting the monomer fold. Two quintet mutations were tested similarly by MD simulations and both mutations showed either partial or complete dissociation of the dimeric form. Overall, this work contributes to the development of IL37-based therapeutics by accurately representing the dimer interface in the PDB structures and identifying five potential substitutions to effectively inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by IL18.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines have successfully contributed to reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious illness, and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, waning immunity induced by these vaccines failed to prevent immune escape by many variants of concern (VOCs) that emerged from 2020 to 2024, resulting in a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that a next-generation Coronavirus (CoV) vaccine incorporating highly conserved non-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antigens would confer stronger and broader cross-protective immunity against multiple VOCs. In the present study, we identified ten non-Spike antigens that are highly conserved in 8.7 million SARS-CoV-2 strains, twenty-one VOCs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Common Cold CoVs, and animal CoVs. Seven of the 10 antigens were preferentially recognized by CD8&#43; and CD4&#43; T-cells from unvaccinated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, irrespective of VOC infection. Three out of the seven conserved non-Spike T cell antigens belong to the early expressed Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC) region, when administered to the golden Syrian hamsters, in combination with Spike, as nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (i.e., combined mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine): (i) Induced high frequencies of lung-resident antigen-specific CXCR5&#43;CD4&#43; T follicular helper (TFH) cells, GzmB&#43;CD4&#43; and GzmB&#43;CD8&#43; cytotoxic T cells (TCYT), and CD69&#43;IFN-{gamma}&#43;TNF&#43;CD4&#43; and CD69&#43;IFN-{gamma}&#43;TNF&#43;CD8&#43; effector T cells (TEFF); and (ii) Reduced viral load and COVID-19-like symptoms caused by various VOCs, including the highly pathogenic B.1.617.2 Delta variant and the highly transmittable heavily Spike-mutated XBB1.5 Omicron sub-variant. The combined mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine could be rapidly adapted for clinical use to confer broader cross-protective immunity against emerging highly mutated and pathogenic VOCs.

IMPORTANCEAs of January 2024, over 1500 individuals in the United States alone are still dying from COVID-19 each week despite the implementation of first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines. The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as the currently circulating highly mutated BA.2.86 and JN.1 Omicron sub-variants, constantly overrode immunity induced by the first-generation Spike-alone-based COVID-19 vaccines. Here we report a next generation broad spectrum combined multi-antigen mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine that consists of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) that delivers three highly conserved non-Spike viral T cell protein antigens together with the Spike protein B-cell antigen. Compared side-by-side to the clinically proven first-generation Spike-alone mRNA/LNP-based vaccine, the combined multi-antigen mRNA/LNP-based pan-CoV vaccine-induced higher frequencies of lung-resident non-Spike antigen-specific T follicular helper (TFH) cells, cytotoxic T cells (TCYT), effector T cells (TEFF) and Spike specific-neutralizing antibodies. This was associated to a potent cross-reactive protection against various VOCs, including the highly pathogenic Delta variant and the highly transmittable heavily Spike-mutated Omicron sub-variants. Our findings suggest an alternative broad-spectrum pan-Coronavirus vaccine capable of (i) disrupting the current COVID-19 booster paradigm; (ii) outpacing the bivalent variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines; and (iii) ending an apparent prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The infective L3 larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus migrate to the small intestine where they take up residence in the submucosa, triggering the formation of complex granulomas around the parasite. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the transcriptional intricacies and cell-cell interactions of the murine small intestine under both steady-state conditions and in response to H. polygyrus infection. Our findings unveil distinct transcriptional signatures in the crypt zone, villi, and granulomas, providing nuanced insights into the molecular dynamics of the host response to parasitic infection. Molecular characterization of H. polygyrus granulomas reveals unique cellular compositions within distinct clusters, shedding light on localized immune activation and cellular dynamics. Utilizing deconvolution techniques, we uncovered common and infection-specific signatures of cell type colocalization, and identified potential ligand-receptor pairs that may mediate communication between the granuloma tissue and the epithelial crypt cells. Additionally, our study highlights the upregulation of genes such as Ccl9, Fcer1g and Tmsb4x within granulomas, suggesting roles in type 2 inflammation, and genes (e.g Reg3b and Mxra7) associated with wound healing and tissue repair. These results not only enhance our understanding of the murine small intestines transcriptional landscape but also provide a platform for exploring host-pathogen interactions. The comprehensive analysis presented here contributes to a holistic comprehension of tissue-specific responses during parasitic infections, offering valuable insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most tonsillectomies in the UK are performed to treat acute recurrent tonsillitis (ART) and tonsil hypertrophy due to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). At present, the pathophysiology of these 2 common conditions is still poorly understood. We have performed optical mesoscopic imaging to reveal the spatial location of two interleukins - IL-17C and IL-1{beta} - associated with tonsillar conditions, with the aim of understanding their possible role as specific disease biomarkers. Using immunofluorescence assays, we have shown that the expression of IL-17C is significantly higher in both the epithelial tissue (p &lt; 0.0001) and core tissues (p = 0.0007) of specimens from patients with ART compared to patients with OSA (n = 17 patients). We also demonstrated significantly higher expression of IL-17C in homogenates of ART patient tissue compared to OSA tissue (p = 0.05). These data suggest that IL-17C may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ART, and may be a potential biomarker of disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process which balances X-linked gene dosage between sexes. Unstimulated T cells lack cytological enrichment of Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), and these modifications become enriched at the Xi after cell stimulation. Here, we examined allele-specific gene expression and the epigenomic profiles of the Xi following T cell stimulation. We found that the Xi in unstimulated T cells is largely dosage compensated and is enriched with the repressive H3K27me3 modification, but not the H2AK119-ubiquitin (Ub) mark, even at promoters of XCI escape genes. Upon CD3/CD28-mediated T cell stimulation, the Xi accumulates H2AK119-Ub and H3K27me3 across the Xi. Next, we examined the T cell signaling pathways responsible for Xist RNA localization to the Xi and found that T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, specifically NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of TCR, is required. Disruption of NF-{kappa}B signaling, using inhibitors or genetic deletions, in mice and patients with immunodeficiencies prevents Xist/XIST RNA accumulation at the Xi and alters expression of some X-linked genes. Our findings reveal a novel connection between NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways which impact XCI maintenance in female T cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils are innate immune cells that display immunomodulatory properties by secreting cytokines and chemokines. By using a mouse model of retroviral infection, we previously uncovered the key immunomodulatory function of neutrophils in promoting protective immunity during antiviral antibody therapy which occurs in a Fc-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils in the context of HIV-1 infection and therapy. We characterized the functional activation and the modulation of Fc{gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs) expression on neutrophils isolated from healthy donors (HD) or people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) upon stimulation with virions, free or in the form of immune complexes (ICs) made with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Neutrophils from HD secreted cytokines/chemokines in small amount upon activation by either stimulus. Interestingly, conditioning of neutrophils from HD with pro-inflammatory cytokines enhanced their cytokine/chemokine production upon activation by HIV-1 and ICs, highlighting that the inflammatory environment is key for neutrophils to show a functional response to these stimuli. Noteworthy, under inflammatory conditions, IC-activated neutrophils showed higher secretion of CXCL1 and CCL4 than HIV-1-stimulated neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophils from PLWH on antiretroviral treatment (ART) maintained their cytokine/chemokine secretion abilities when stimulated by TLR agonists, TNF; or HIV-1/ICs. However, they displayed different phenotypic features as compared with neutrophils isolated from HD, notably higher expression of Fc{gamma}Rs. Our study provides new insights into the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils during HIV-1 infection and therapy. This might contribute to the improvement of antiviral antibody therapies through the use of therapeutic approaches exploiting the immunomodulatory properties of these cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) conditioning using antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) is a promising alternative to conventional chemotherapy- and irradiation-based conditioning regimens. The drug payload bound to an ADC is a key contributor to its efficacy and potential toxicities; however, a comparison of HSCT conditioning ADCs produced with different toxic payloads has not been performed. Indeed, ADC optimization studies in general are hampered by the inability to produce and screen multiple combinations of antibody and drug payload in a rapid, cost-effective manner. Herein, we used Click chemistry to covalently conjugate four different small molecule payloads to streptavidin; these streptavidin-drug conjugates can then be joined to any biotinylated antibody to produce stable, indirectly conjugated ADCs. Evaluating CD45-targeted ADCs produced with this system, we found the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer SGD-1882 was the most effective payload for targeting mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and acute myeloid leukemia cells. In murine syngeneic HSCT studies, a single dose of CD45-PBD enabled near-complete conversion to donor hematopoiesis. Finally, human CD45-PBD provided significant antitumor benefit in a patient-derived xenograft model of acute myeloid leukemia. As our streptavidin-drug conjugates were generated in-house with readily accessible equipment, reagents, and routine molecular biology techniques, we anticipate this flexible platform will facilitate the evaluation and optimization of ADCs for myriad targeting applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), remains a significant health concern worldwide, especially in populations with weakened or compromised immune systems, such as the elderly. Proper adaptive immune function, particularly a CD4&#43; T cell response, is central to host immunity against M.tb. Chronic infections, such as M.tb, as well as aging promote T cell exhaustion and senescence, which can impair immune control and promote progression to TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T cell dysfunction, both in aging and chronic infections and diseases. Mitochondrial perturbations can disrupt cellular metabolism, enhance oxidative stress, and impair T-cell signaling and effector functions. This study examined the impact of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4&#43; T cell differentiation and function using aged mouse models and human CD4&#43; T cells from elderly individuals. Our study revealed that mito-transfer in naive CD4&#43; T cells promoted the generation of protective effector and memory CD4&#43; T cells during M.tb infection in mice. Further, mito-transfer enhanced the function of elderly human T cells by increasing their mitochondrial mass and modulating cytokine production, which in turn reduced exhaustion and senescence cell markers. Our results suggest that mito-transfer could be a novel strategy to reestablish aged CD4&#43; T cell function, potentially improving immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients, with a broader implication for other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to T cell exhaustion and senescence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parkinsons disease (PD) is associated with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein alpha-synuclein in a subset of individuals. Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN{gamma}, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IL37 plays important roles in the regulation of innate immunity and its oligomeric status is critical to these roles. In its monomeric state, IL37 can effectively inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by IL18 through binding to the IL18 receptor , a capability lost in its dimeric form. This paradigm underscores the pivotal role of IL37s dimer structure in the design of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Hitherto, two IL37 dimer structures were deposited in PDB, reflecting the potential use of their binding interface in the design of IL37 variants with altered dimerization tendencies. Inspection of these static structures suggested a substantial difference in their dimer interfaces. Prompted by this discrepancy, we analyzed the PDB structures of IL37 dimer (PDB: 6ncu and 5hn1) along with a predicted structure by AF2-multimer by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel whether and how IL37 can form homodimers through distinct interfaces. Results showed that the 5hn1 and AF2 dimers, which shared the same interface, stably maintained their initial conformations throughout the simulations whilst the recent IL37 dimer (PDB ID: 6ncu) with a different interface, did not. These findings underscored that the recent IL37 dimer (6ncu) structure is likely to contain an error, probably in its biological assembly record, otherwise it was not a stable assembly in silico. Next, focusing on the stable dimer structure of 5hn1, we have identified five critical positions of V71/Y85/I86/E89/S114 that would altogether reduce dimer stability without affecting the monomer fold. Two quintet mutations were tested similarly by MD simulations and both mutations showed either partial or complete dissociation of the dimeric form. Overall, this work contributes to the development of IL37-based therapeutics by accurately representing the dimer interface in the PDB structures and identifying five potential substitutions to effectively inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by IL18.</p>
