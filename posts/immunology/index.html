While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.\nThe tissue-resident regulatory T cell pool is shaped by transient multi-tissue migration and a conserved residency program\nAuthors: Burton, O.; Bricard, O.; Tareen, S.; Gergelits, V.; Andrews, S.; Roca, C. P.; Whyte, C.; Junius, S.; Brajic, A.; Pasciuto, E.; Ali, M.; Lemaitre, P.; Schlenner, S. M.; Ishigame, H.; Brown, B.; Dooley, J.; Liston, A.\nScore: 87.9, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553196\nThe tissues are the site of many of the most important immunological reactions, yet the immunology of the tissues has remained relatively opaque. Recent studies have identified Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.\nTemperature sensitivity of bat antibodies links metabolic state with antigen-recognition diversity\nAuthors: Toshkova, N.; Zhelyzkova, V.; Reyes-Ruiz, A.; de Castro Deus, M.; Lacombe, R. V.; Lecerf, M.; Planchais, C.; Dimitrov, J. D.\nScore: 36.3, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553222\nImmune system in bats features multiple unique properties that result in overall dampened inflammatory responses and increased tissue protection, explaining their tolerance to viral infections and unusually long lifespan. As heterothermic animals, bats exhibit large variations in body temperature on a daily and seasonal basis. In the present study, we demonstrated that temperature fluctuations corresponding to different physiological states in bats exert a dramatic impact on bat antibody repertoires. At temperatures typical for elevated metabolic activity during flight, IgG antibodies from Myotis myotis (Borkhausen, 1797) and Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774) largely broaden their antigen binding diversity and affinity, recognizing both pathogen-derived and autoantigens. On the contrary, at temperatures reflecting inactive physiological states (torpor, hibernation), the breadth of immune diversity is substantially reduced. Importantly, temperature-dependent diversification of antibody specificities results in preferential recognition of damaged but not alive endothelial cells. This indicats that metabolism might influence not only pathogen recognition function but also anti-inflammatory functions of bat antibodies. Our mechanistic studies revealed particular molecular features of bat IgG, such as low thermodynamic stability and increased hydrophobicity, that can explain their distinctive behavior. This study reveals another facet of the enigmatic immune system of bats, extends our understanding of disease tolerance, highlights the link between metabolism and immunity, and might have important repercussions for human health.\nDendritic cell-mediated responses to secreted Cryptosporidium effectors are required for parasite-specific CD8+ T cell responses\nAuthors: Haskins, B. E.; Gullicksrud, J. A.; Wallbank, B. A.; Dumaine, J. E.; Guerin, A.; Cohn, I. S.; O'Dea, K. M.; Pardy, R. D.; Merolle, M. I.; Shallberg, L. A.; Hunter, E. N.; Byerly, J. H.; Smith, E. J.; Buenconsejo, G. Y.; McLeod, B. I.; Christian, D. A.; Striepen, B.; Hunter, C. A.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553566\nCryptosporidium causes debilitating diarrheal disease in patients with primary and acquired defects in T cell function. However, it has been a challenge to understand how this infection generates T cell responses and how they mediate parasite control. Here, Cryptosporidium was engineered to express a parasite effector protein (MEDLE-2) that contains the MHC-I restricted SIINFEKL epitope which is recognized by TCR transgenic OT-I CD8+ T cells. These modified parasites induced expansion of endogenous SIINFEKL-specific and OT-I CD8+ T cells that were a source of IFN-{gamma} that could restrict growth of Cryptosporidium. This T cell response was dependent on the translocation of the effector and similar results were observed with another secreted parasite effector (ROP1). Although infection and these translocated effector proteins are restricted to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), type I dendritic cells (cDC1) were required to generate CD8+ T cell responses to these model antigens. These data sets highlight Cryptosporidium effectors as targets of the immune system and suggest that crosstalk between enterocytes and cDC1s is crucial for CD8+ T cell responses to Cryptosporidium.\nBespoke conformation and antibody recognition distinguishes the streptococcal immune evasion factors EndoS and EndoS2\nAuthors: Sudol, A. S. L.; Tews, I.; Crispin, M.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553389\nThe IgG-specific endoglycosidases EndoS and EndoS2 from Streptococcus pyogenes ablate IgG function by removing the conserved N-linked glycans present on the Fc region. Their role in immune evasion, by inactivation of IgG antibodies, has led these enzymes to be investigated as therapeutics for suppressing unwanted immune activation. Their activity and precise substrate specificity has also prompted the development of these enzymes as tools for engineering IgG glycosylation. Recent structural studies have revealed how EndoS drives specificity for IgG by binding the Fc peptide surface with a domain that has homology for a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Here, we present the crystal structure of the EndoS2-IgG1 Fc complex at 3.0 [A] resolution. Comparison with the EndoS-IgG1 Fc structure reveals a similar mode of interaction, but slightly different orientations resulting from different interfaces with glycosidase and CBM domains, leading to recognition of distinct Fc surfaces. These findings rationalise previous observations that non-catalytic domains cannot readily be substituted. The structural information presented here will guide the continued development of IgG-specific endoglycosidases in antibody glycoengineering and immunotherapy.\nTertiary lymphoid structures are associated with enhanced macrophage and dendritic cell activation and proximity to CD8+ T cells, which better predict the clinical outcome of cervical cancer patients\nAuthors: Gorvel, L.; Panouillot, M.; Rouviere, M.-S.; Sonongbua, J.; Fattori, S.; Boucherit, N.; Ben Amara, A.; Quilichini, O.; GRANJEAUD, S.; Degos, C.; Carcopino, X.; Lambaudie, E.; Chretien, A.-S.; Sabatier, R.; Dieu-Nosjean, M.-C.; Olive, D.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.552583\nCervical tumors are usually treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and would benefit from immunotherapies. However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We integratedly evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, and specifically TLS importance, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor dosage, spatial interaction analyses, and statistical analyses. We demonstrate that TLS presence is associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation is associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and close proximity of activated conventional DC2 to CD8+ T cells, therefore indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associate TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density to improved progression-free survival, and present it as an independent prognostic marker. To conclude, our results provide an exhaustive depiction of the cervical tumor immune microenvironment where TLS presence marks cell activation and immunotherapy target expression. These findings may provide predictive clues for patient response to targeted immunotherapies.\nCell therapy with IL-10-producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells suppresses Graft-versus-Host disease\nAuthors: Reid, K. T.; Colpitts, S. J.; Mathews, J. A.; Carreira, A. S.; Murphy, J. M.; Borovsky, D. T.; Cui, W.; Moya, T. A.; Sachewsky, N.; An, J.; Xia, Y.; Mortha, A.; Lee, J. B.; Zhang, L.; Novitzky-Basso, I.; Mattsson, J.; Crome, S. Q.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554158\nIL-10 producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC210) have immunoregulatory functions, and limit harmful immune responses across various tissues. Despite their crucial roles in maintaining immune homeostasis, the cell therapy potential of human ILC210 has not been demonstrated, due to both limited numbers in human peripheral blood and lack of definitive markers for identification. Here, we isolate and expand circulating human ILC210, and assess their cell therapy potential in a humanized model of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Cell therapy with human ILC210 decreased GVHD severity and prolonged survival of NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}null (NSG) mice. Adoptive transfer of ILC210 inhibited pathogenic T cell proliferation and intestinal infiltration, and suppressed CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ Tc1 cells in an IL-4 and IL-10 dependent manner. Critically, increased proportions of ILC2s did not correlate with higher rates of cancer relapse in HSCT recipients, and adoptive transfer of ILC210 did not compromise graft-versus-leukemic (GVL) effects in a humanized model. Finally, we identify CD49d and CD86 as novel markers that discriminate ILC210 from conventional ILC2s. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing ILC210 in cell therapies for GVHD and other immune-driven pathologies.\nNAD+ prevents septic shock-induced death by non-canonical inflammasome blockade and IL-10 cytokine production in macrophages\nAuthors: Iske, J.; EL Fatimy, R.; Nian, Y.; Ghouzlani, A.; Eskandari, S.; Cetina Biefer, H. R.; Vasudevan, A.; Elkhal, A.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.29.013649\nSeptic shock is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response depicted in a cytokine storm that results from invasive bacterial, fungi, protozoa, and viral infections. Non-canonical inflammasome activation is crucial in the development of septic shock promoting pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production via caspase-11 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD). Here, we show that NAD+ treatment protected mice towards bacterial and LPS induced endotoxic shock by blocking the non-canonical inflammasome specifically. NAD+ administration impeded systemic IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages via the IFN-{beta}/STAT-1 signaling machinery. More importantly, NAD+ administration not only improved casp-11-/- survival but rendered WT mice completely resistant to septic shock via the IL-10 signaling pathway that was independent from the non-canonical inflammasome. Here, we delineated a two-sided effect of NAD+ blocking septic shock through a specific inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting immune homeostasis via IL-10, underscoring its unique therapeutic potential.\nEarly life high fructose exposure disrupts microglia function and impedes neurodevelopment\nAuthors: Wang, Z.; Lipschutz, A.; Liu, Z.-L.; Trzeciak, A.; Miranda, I.; Martinez de la Torre, C.; Schild, T.; Lazarov, T.; Rojas, W. S.; Saavedra, P.; Romero-Pichardo, J.; Baako, A.; Geissmann, F.; Faraco, G.; Gan, L.; Etchegaray, J. I.; Lucas, C.; Parkhurst, C.; Zeng, M.; Keshari, K.; Perry, J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553242\nDespite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption by pregnant mothers or during adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1-7. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the synaptic pruning and elimination of newly-formed neurons by microglia, the central nervous systems (CNS) resident professional phagocyte8-10. Whether early life high fructose consumption affects microglia function and if this directly impacts neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here, we show that both offspring born to dams fed a high fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased microglial density, increased uncleared apoptotic cells, and decreased synaptic pruning in vivo. Importantly, deletion of the high affinity fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5) in neonates completely reversed microglia dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development. Mechanistically, we found that high fructose treatment of both mouse and human microglia suppresses synaptic pruning and phagocytosis capacity which is fully reversed in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based fructose tracing, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism, rewiring microglia metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state. Importantly, mice exposed to high fructose as neonates exhibited cognitive defects and developed anxiety-like behavior which were rescued in GLUT5-deficient animals. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that early life high fructose exposure is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.\nA tryptophan metabolite modulates the host response to bacterial infection via kainate receptors\nAuthors: Parada-Kusz, M.; Clatworthy, A. E.; Goering, E. R.; Blackwood, S. M.; Salm, E. J.; Choi, C.; Combs, S.; Lee, J. S.; Rodriguez-Osorio, C.; Tomita, S.; Hung, D. T.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553532\nBacterial infection involves a complex interaction between the pathogen and host where the outcome of infection is not solely determined by pathogen eradication. To identify small molecules that promote host survival by altering the host-pathogen dynamic, we conducted an in vivo chemical screen using zebrafish embryos and found that treatment with 3-hydroxy-kynurenine protects from lethal gram-negative bacterial infection. 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, a metabolite produced through host tryptophan metabolism, has no direct antibacterial activity but enhances host survival by restricting bacterial expansion in macrophages by targeting kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors. These findings reveal new mechanisms by which tryptophan metabolism and kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors function and interact to modulate immunity, with significant implications for the coordination between the immune and nervous systems in pathological conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 patients present higher risk for myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, and stroke for up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributes to this increased cardiovascular risk, whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the coronary vasculature and attendant atherosclerotic plaques to locally promote inflammation remains unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) is detectable and replicates in coronary atherosclerotic lesions taken at autopsy from patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 localizes to plaque macrophages and shows a stronger tropism for arterial lesions compared to corresponding perivascular fat, correlating with the degree of macrophage infiltration. In vitro infection of human primary macrophages highlights that SARS-CoV-2 entry is increased in cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and is dependent, in part, on neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Furthermore, although viral replication is abortive, SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust inflammatory response that includes interleukins IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, key cytokines known to trigger ischemic cardiovascular events. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human atherosclerotic vascular explants recapitulates the immune response seen in cultured macrophages, including pro-atherogenic cytokine secretion. Collectively, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 infects macrophages in coronary atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in plaque inflammation that may promote acute CV complications and long-term risk for CV events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tissues are the site of many of the most important immunological reactions, yet the immunology of the tissues has remained relatively opaque. Recent studies have identified Foxp3&#43; regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several non-lymphoid tissues. These tissue-resident populations have been ascribed unique characteristics based on comparisons to lymphoid Tregs. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the Treg population residing in non-lymphoid organs throughout the body, revealing shared phenotypes, transient residency and common molecular dependencies. Further, tissue Tregs from different non-lymphoid organs shared T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, with functional capacity to drive multi-tissue Treg entry. Finally, tissue Tregs extracted from non-lymphoid organs were tissue-agnostic on re-entry, without homing preference for their tissue of origin. Together these results demonstrate that the tissue-resident Treg pool in most non-lymphoid organs, other than the gut, is largely constituted by broadly self-reactive Tregs, characterised by transient multi-tissue migration and a common residency program.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune system in bats features multiple unique properties that result in overall dampened inflammatory responses and increased tissue protection, explaining their tolerance to viral infections and unusually long lifespan. As heterothermic animals, bats exhibit large variations in body temperature on a daily and seasonal basis. In the present study, we demonstrated that temperature fluctuations corresponding to different physiological states in bats exert a dramatic impact on bat antibody repertoires. At temperatures typical for elevated metabolic activity during flight, IgG antibodies from Myotis myotis (Borkhausen, 1797) and Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774) largely broaden their antigen binding diversity and affinity, recognizing both pathogen-derived and autoantigens. On the contrary, at temperatures reflecting inactive physiological states (torpor, hibernation), the breadth of immune diversity is substantially reduced. Importantly, temperature-dependent diversification of antibody specificities results in preferential recognition of damaged but not alive endothelial cells. This indicats that metabolism might influence not only pathogen recognition function but also anti-inflammatory functions of bat antibodies. Our mechanistic studies revealed particular molecular features of bat IgG, such as low thermodynamic stability and increased hydrophobicity, that can explain their distinctive behavior. This study reveals another facet of the enigmatic immune system of bats, extends our understanding of disease tolerance, highlights the link between metabolism and immunity, and might have important repercussions for human health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryptosporidium causes debilitating diarrheal disease in patients with primary and acquired defects in T cell function. However, it has been a challenge to understand how this infection generates T cell responses and how they mediate parasite control. Here, Cryptosporidium was engineered to express a parasite effector protein (MEDLE-2) that contains the MHC-I restricted SIINFEKL epitope which is recognized by TCR transgenic OT-I CD8&#43; T cells. These modified parasites induced expansion of endogenous SIINFEKL-specific and OT-I CD8&#43; T cells that were a source of IFN-{gamma} that could restrict growth of Cryptosporidium. This T cell response was dependent on the translocation of the effector and similar results were observed with another secreted parasite effector (ROP1). Although infection and these translocated effector proteins are restricted to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), type I dendritic cells (cDC1) were required to generate CD8&#43; T cell responses to these model antigens. These data sets highlight Cryptosporidium effectors as targets of the immune system and suggest that crosstalk between enterocytes and cDC1s is crucial for CD8&#43; T cell responses to Cryptosporidium.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The IgG-specific endoglycosidases EndoS and EndoS2 from Streptococcus pyogenes ablate IgG function by removing the conserved N-linked glycans present on the Fc region. Their role in immune evasion, by inactivation of IgG antibodies, has led these enzymes to be investigated as therapeutics for suppressing unwanted immune activation. Their activity and precise substrate specificity has also prompted the development of these enzymes as tools for engineering IgG glycosylation. Recent structural studies have revealed how EndoS drives specificity for IgG by binding the Fc peptide surface with a domain that has homology for a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Here, we present the crystal structure of the EndoS2-IgG1 Fc complex at 3.0 [A] resolution. Comparison with the EndoS-IgG1 Fc structure reveals a similar mode of interaction, but slightly different orientations resulting from different interfaces with glycosidase and CBM domains, leading to recognition of distinct Fc surfaces. These findings rationalise previous observations that non-catalytic domains cannot readily be substituted. The structural information presented here will guide the continued development of IgG-specific endoglycosidases in antibody glycoengineering and immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cervical tumors are usually treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and would benefit from immunotherapies. However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We integratedly evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, and specifically TLS importance, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor dosage, spatial interaction analyses, and statistical analyses. We demonstrate that TLS presence is associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation is associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and close proximity of activated conventional DC2 to CD8&#43; T cells, therefore indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associate TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density to improved progression-free survival, and present it as an independent prognostic marker. To conclude, our results provide an exhaustive depiction of the cervical tumor immune microenvironment where TLS presence marks cell activation and immunotherapy target expression. These findings may provide predictive clues for patient response to targeted immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IL-10 producing group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC210) have immunoregulatory functions, and limit harmful immune responses across various tissues. Despite their crucial roles in maintaining immune homeostasis, the cell therapy potential of human ILC210 has not been demonstrated, due to both limited numbers in human peripheral blood and lack of definitive markers for identification. Here, we isolate and expand circulating human ILC210, and assess their cell therapy potential in a humanized model of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Cell therapy with human ILC210 decreased GVHD severity and prolonged survival of NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}null (NSG) mice. Adoptive transfer of ILC210 inhibited pathogenic T cell proliferation and intestinal infiltration, and suppressed CD4&#43; Th1 and CD8&#43; Tc1 cells in an IL-4 and IL-10 dependent manner. Critically, increased proportions of ILC2s did not correlate with higher rates of cancer relapse in HSCT recipients, and adoptive transfer of ILC210 did not compromise graft-versus-leukemic (GVL) effects in a humanized model. Finally, we identify CD49d and CD86 as novel markers that discriminate ILC210 from conventional ILC2s. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing ILC210 in cell therapies for GVHD and other immune-driven pathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Septic shock is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response depicted in a cytokine storm that results from invasive bacterial, fungi, protozoa, and viral infections. Non-canonical inflammasome activation is crucial in the development of septic shock promoting pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production via caspase-11 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD). Here, we show that NAD&#43; treatment protected mice towards bacterial and LPS induced endotoxic shock by blocking the non-canonical inflammasome specifically. NAD&#43; administration impeded systemic IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages via the IFN-{beta}/STAT-1 signaling machinery. More importantly, NAD&#43; administration not only improved casp-11-/- survival but rendered WT mice completely resistant to septic shock via the IL-10 signaling pathway that was independent from the non-canonical inflammasome. Here, we delineated a two-sided effect of NAD&#43; blocking septic shock through a specific inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting immune homeostasis via IL-10, underscoring its unique therapeutic potential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption by pregnant mothers or during adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1-7. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the synaptic pruning and elimination of newly-formed neurons by microglia, the central nervous systems (CNS) resident professional phagocyte8-10. Whether early life high fructose consumption affects microglia function and if this directly impacts neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here, we show that both offspring born to dams fed a high fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased microglial density, increased uncleared apoptotic cells, and decreased synaptic pruning in vivo. Importantly, deletion of the high affinity fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5) in neonates completely reversed microglia dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development. Mechanistically, we found that high fructose treatment of both mouse and human microglia suppresses synaptic pruning and phagocytosis capacity which is fully reversed in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based fructose tracing, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism, rewiring microglia metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state. Importantly, mice exposed to high fructose as neonates exhibited cognitive defects and developed anxiety-like behavior which were rescued in GLUT5-deficient animals. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that early life high fructose exposure is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial infection involves a complex interaction between the pathogen and host where the outcome of infection is not solely determined by pathogen eradication. To identify small molecules that promote host survival by altering the host-pathogen dynamic, we conducted an in vivo chemical screen using zebrafish embryos and found that treatment with 3-hydroxy-kynurenine protects from lethal gram-negative bacterial infection. 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, a metabolite produced through host tryptophan metabolism, has no direct antibacterial activity but enhances host survival by restricting bacterial expansion in macrophages by targeting kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors. These findings reveal new mechanisms by which tryptophan metabolism and kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors function and interact to modulate immunity, with significant implications for the coordination between the immune and nervous systems in pathological conditions.</p>
