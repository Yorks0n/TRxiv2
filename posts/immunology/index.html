S.\nScore: 37.0, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.578771\nThe rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination (~1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.\nCytotoxic CD4+ T cells in the bone marrow compromise healthy ageing by enhancing granulopoiesis\nAuthors: Gabande-Rodriguez, E.; Soto-Heredero, G.; Carrasco, E.; Anerillas, C.; Escrig-Larena, J.

Despite their essential role as a primary line of defense, neutrophils can contribute to tissue damage and age-related diseases 1 and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts all causes of mortality in the elderly 2-5. However, the precise mechanisms driving enhanced neutrophil generation during ageing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a subset of CD4+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype (CD4+ CTLs) producing the chemokine CCL5 and harbouring dysfunctional mitochondria, infiltrate the bone marrow and induce granulopoiesis in aged mice. During ageing, hematopoietic stem cells upregulate CCR5, the primary receptor for CCL5, and its deficiency limits the T cell-mediated induction of granulopoiesis and neutrophil output. Treatment with the FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc decreases granulopoiesis and lowers the levels of circulatory and tissue-infiltrating neutrophils, ameliorating multiple ageing biomarkers and improving functional outcomes in aged mice. These findings suggest that age-associated alterations in T cells reduce health outcomes by remodelling the bone marrow niche and enhancing neutrophil generation. Consequently, interventions to disrupt the interplay between T cells and hematopoietic stem cells hold substantial therapeutic potential to ameliorate age-associated diseases.\nLearning predictive signatures of HLA type from T-cell repertoires\nAuthors: Ortega, M. R.; Pogorelyy, M.; Minervina, A.; Thomas, P.; Walczak, A.; Mora, T.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577228\nT cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with pep-tides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.\nSingle-cell transcriptomics reveals colonic immune perturbations during amyloid-β driven Alzheimer's disease in mice\nAuthors: Makhijani, P.; Emani, R.; Aguirre, C.

A.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.27.573841\nThe \"gut-brain axis\" is emerging as an important target in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immunological mechanisms underlying this axis remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the colon immune compartment in the 5XFAD amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) mouse model, we uncovered AD-associated changes in ribosomal activity, oxidative stress, and BCR/plasma cell activity. Strikingly, levels of colon CXCR4+ antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were significantly reduced. This corresponded with accumulating CXCR4+ B cells and gut-specific IgA+ cells in the brain and dura mater, respectively. Consistently, a chemokine ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, was expressed at higher levels in 5XFAD glial cells and in in silico analyzed human brain studies, supporting altered neuroimmune trafficking. An inulin prebiotic fiber diet attenuated AD markers including A{beta} plaques and overall frailty. These changes corresponded to an expansion of gut IgA+ cells and rescued peripheral Tregs levels. Our study points to a key glia-gut axis and potential targets against AD. Study HighlightsO_LIAD is associated with altered immune parameters in the gut of 5XFAD mice.

C.; Looney, M. R.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577129\nAntibodies can initiate lung injury in a variety of disease states such as autoimmunity, transfusion reactions, or after organ transplantation, but the key factors determining in vivo pathogenicity of injury-inducing antibodies are unclear. A previously overlooked step in complement activation by IgG antibodies has been elucidated involving interactions between IgG Fc domains that enable assembly of IgG hexamers, which can optimally activate the complement cascade. Here, we tested the in vivo relevance of IgG hexamers in a complement-dependent alloantibody model of acute lung injury. We used three approaches to block alloantibody hexamerization (antibody carbamylation, the K439E Fc mutation, or treatment with domain B from Staphylococcal protein A), all of which reduced acute lung injury. Conversely, Fc mutations promoting spontaneous hexamerization made a harmful alloantibody into a more potent inducer of acute lung injury and rendered an innocuous alloantibody pathogenic. Treatment with a recombinant Fc hexamer decoy therapeutic protected mice from lung injury, including in a model with transgenic human FCGR2A expression that exacerbated pathology. These results indicate a direct in vivo role of IgG hexamerization in initiating acute lung injury and the potential for therapeutics that inhibit or mimic hexamerization to treat antibody-mediated diseases. Brief summaryIgG antibodies can form hexamers. This study shows that hexamer assembly is an important event determining the ability of IgG to trigger acute lung injury.

A.; Reboldi, A.; Bucci, V.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.574039\nMetabolic byproducts of the intestinal microbiota are crucial in maintaining host immune tone and shaping inter-species ecological dynamics. Among these metabolites, succinate is a driver of tuft cell (TC) differentiation and consequent type 2 immunity-dependent protection against invading parasites in the small intestine. Succinate is also a growth enhancer of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile in the large intestine. To date, no research has shown the role of succinate in modulating TC dynamics in the large intestine, or the relevance of this immune pathway to C. difficile pathophysiology. Here we reveal the existence of a three-way circuit between commensal microbes, C. difficile and host epithelial cells which centers around succinate. Through selective microbiota depletion experiments we demonstrate higher levels of type 2 cytokines leading to expansion of TCs in the colon. We then demonstrate the causal role of the microbiome in modulating colonic TC abundance and subsequent type 2 cytokine induction using rational supplementation experiments with fecal transplants and microbial consortia of succinate-producing bacteria. We show that administration of a succinate-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron knockout ({Delta}frd) significantly reduces the enhanced type 2 immunity in mono-colonized mice. Finally, we demonstrate that mice prophylactically administered with the consortium of succinate-producing bacteria show reduced C. difficile-induced morbidity and mortality compared to mice administered with heat-killed bacteria or the vehicle. This effect is reduced in a partial tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3+/-, and nullified in the tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3-/-, confirming that the observed protection occurs via the TC pathway. Succinate is an intermediary metabolite of the production of short-chain fatty acids, and its concentration often increases during dysbiosis. The first barrier to enteric pathogens alike is the intestinal epithelial barrier, and host maintenance and strengthening of barrier integrity is vital to homeostasis. Considering our data, we propose that activation of TC by the microbiota-produced succinate in the colon is a mechanism evolved by the host to counterbalance microbiome-derived cues that facilitate invasion by intestinal pathogens.\nOpposing roles of resident and infiltrating immune cells in the defence against Legionella longbeachae via IL-18R/IFN-γ/ROS axis\nAuthors: Oberkircher, L. M.; Scheiding, V. M.; Rafeld, H. L.; Hanssen, E.; Hansen, J. N.; Fleischmann, M. J.; Kessler, N. M.; Pitsch, D.; Wachten, D.; Kastenmueller, W.; Brown, A. S.; Hartland, E.; van Driel, I. R.; Ng, G. Z.; Garbi, N.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578217\nThe immune response against Legionella longbeachae, a causative agent of the often-fatal Legionnaires pneumonia, is poorly understood. Here we investigated the specific roles of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (AM) and infiltrating phagocytes during infection with this pathogen. AM were the predominant cell type that phagocytosed bacteria o day after infection. Three and five days after infection, AM numbers were greatly reduced while there was an influx of neutrophils and later monocyte-derived cells (MC) into lung tissue. AM carried greater numbers of viable L. longbeachae than neutrophils and MC, which correlated with a higher capacity of L. longbeachae to translocate bacterial effector proteins required for bacterial replication into the AM cytosol. Cell ablation experiments demonstrated that AM promoted infection whereas neutrophils and MC were required for efficient bacterial clearance. IL-18 was important for IFN-{gamma} production by IL-18R+ NK cells and T cells which, in turn, stimulated ROS-mediated bactericidal activity in neutrophils resulting in restriction of L. longbeachae infection. Ciliated epithelial cells also expressed IL-18R but did not play a role in IL-18-mediated L. longbeachae clearance. Our results have identified opposing innate functions of tissue-resident and infiltrating immune cells during L. longbeachae infection that may be manipulated to improve protective responses.

P.; Oscarson, S.; Casadevall, A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578725\nCryptococcus neoformans is a fungus classified by the World Health Organization as a critically important pathogen, posing a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we present the chemical synthesis and evaluation of two semi-synthetic vaccine candidates targeting the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) of C. neoformans. These semi-synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines contain the identical synthetic decasaccharide (M2 motif) antigen. This motif is present in serotype A strains, which constitute 95% of clinical cryptococcosis cases. This synthetic oligosaccharide was conjugated to two proteins (CRM197 and Anthrax 63 kDa PA) and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The conjugates elicited a specific antibody response that bound to the M2 motif but also exhibited additional cross-reactivity towards M1 and M4 GXM motifs. Both glycoconjugates produced antibodies that bound to GXM in ELISA assays and to live fungal cells. Mice immunized with the CRM197 glycoconjugate produced opsonic antibodies and displayed trends toward increased median survival relative to mice given a mock PBS injection (18 vs 15 days, p = 0.06). While these findings indicate promise, achieving a successful vaccine demands further optimization of the glycoconjugate. It could serve as a component in a multi-valent GXM motif vaccine, enhancing both strength and breadth of immune responses.\nA nox2 / cybb zebrafish mutant with defective neutrophil ROS production displays normal initial neutrophil recruitment to sterile tail injuries\nAuthors: Lieschke, G. J.; Isiaku, A. I.; Zhang, Z.; Pazhakh, V.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578645\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are important effectors and modifiers of the acute inflammatory response, recruiting neutrophils to sites of tissue injury. In turn, neutrophils are both consumers and producers of reactive oxygen species. Stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species in an oxidative burst through the activity of a multimeric phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Mutations in the NOX2/CYBB (previously gp91phox) NADPH oxidase subunit are the commonest cause of chronic granulomatous disease, a disease characterized by infection susceptibility and an inflammatory phenotype. To model chronic granulomatous disease, we made a nox2/cybb zebrafish (Danio rerio) mutant and demonstrated it to have severely impaired neutrophil ROS production. Reduced early survival of nox2 mutant embryos indicated an essential requirement for nox2 during early development. In nox2/cybb zebrafish mutants, the dynamics of initial neutrophil recruitment to both mild and severe surgical tailfin wounds was normal, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment at the initiation of inflammation is not the primary cause of the \"sterile\" inflammatory phenotype of chronic granulomatous disease patients. This nox2 zebrafish mutant adds to existing in vivo models for studying neutrophil reactive oxygen species function in development and disease.\nChemokine expression profile of an innate granuloma\nAuthors: Amason, M. E.; Harvest, C. K.; Beatty, C. J.; Saban, D. R.; Miao, E. A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577927\nGranulomas are defined by the presence of organized layers of immune cells that include macrophages. Granulomas are often characterized as a way for the immune system to contain an infection and prevent its dissemination. We recently established a mouse infection model where Chromobacterium violaceum induces the innate immune system to form granulomas in the liver. This response successfully eradicates the bacteria and returns the liver to homeostasis. Here, we sought to characterize the chemokines involved in directing immune cells to form the distinct layers of a granuloma. We use spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of all CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors within this granuloma response. The expression profiles change dynamically over space and time as the granuloma matures and then resolves. To investigate the importance of monocyte-derived macrophages in this immune response, we studied the role of CCR2 during C. violaceum infection. Ccr2-/- mice had negligible numbers of macrophages, but large numbers of neutrophils, in the C. violaceum-infected lesions. In addition, lesions had abnormal architecture resulting in loss of bacterial containment. Without CCR2, bacteria disseminated and the mice succumbed to the infection. This indicates that macrophages are critical to form a successful innate granuloma in response to C. violaceum. Impact statementA successful innate granuloma requires CCR2 to organize the macrophage ring, and without CCR2, mice succumb to Chromobacterium violaceum infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination (~1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in the blood, with numbers further increasing with age. Despite their essential role as a primary line of defense, neutrophils can contribute to tissue damage and age-related diseases 1 and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts all causes of mortality in the elderly 2-5. However, the precise mechanisms driving enhanced neutrophil generation during ageing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a subset of CD4&#43; T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype (CD4&#43; CTLs) producing the chemokine CCL5 and harbouring dysfunctional mitochondria, infiltrate the bone marrow and induce granulopoiesis in aged mice. During ageing, hematopoietic stem cells upregulate CCR5, the primary receptor for CCL5, and its deficiency limits the T cell-mediated induction of granulopoiesis and neutrophil output. Treatment with the FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc decreases granulopoiesis and lowers the levels of circulatory and tissue-infiltrating neutrophils, ameliorating multiple ageing biomarkers and improving functional outcomes in aged mice. These findings suggest that age-associated alterations in T cells reduce health outcomes by remodelling the bone marrow niche and enhancing neutrophil generation. Consequently, interventions to disrupt the interplay between T cells and hematopoietic stem cells hold substantial therapeutic potential to ameliorate age-associated diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with pep-tides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The &#34;gut-brain axis&#34; is emerging as an important target in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immunological mechanisms underlying this axis remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the colon immune compartment in the 5XFAD amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) mouse model, we uncovered AD-associated changes in ribosomal activity, oxidative stress, and BCR/plasma cell activity. Strikingly, levels of colon CXCR4&#43; antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were significantly reduced. This corresponded with accumulating CXCR4&#43; B cells and gut-specific IgA&#43; cells in the brain and dura mater, respectively. Consistently, a chemokine ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, was expressed at higher levels in 5XFAD glial cells and in in silico analyzed human brain studies, supporting altered neuroimmune trafficking. An inulin prebiotic fiber diet attenuated AD markers including A{beta} plaques and overall frailty. These changes corresponded to an expansion of gut IgA&#43; cells and rescued peripheral Tregs levels. Our study points to a key glia-gut axis and potential targets against AD.

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies can initiate lung injury in a variety of disease states such as autoimmunity, transfusion reactions, or after organ transplantation, but the key factors determining in vivo pathogenicity of injury-inducing antibodies are unclear. A previously overlooked step in complement activation by IgG antibodies has been elucidated involving interactions between IgG Fc domains that enable assembly of IgG hexamers, which can optimally activate the complement cascade. Here, we tested the in vivo relevance of IgG hexamers in a complement-dependent alloantibody model of acute lung injury. We used three approaches to block alloantibody hexamerization (antibody carbamylation, the K439E Fc mutation, or treatment with domain B from Staphylococcal protein A), all of which reduced acute lung injury. Conversely, Fc mutations promoting spontaneous hexamerization made a harmful alloantibody into a more potent inducer of acute lung injury and rendered an innocuous alloantibody pathogenic. Treatment with a recombinant Fc hexamer  decoy therapeutic protected mice from lung injury, including in a model with transgenic human FCGR2A expression that exacerbated pathology. These results indicate a direct in vivo role of IgG hexamerization in initiating acute lung injury and the potential for therapeutics that inhibit or mimic hexamerization to treat antibody-mediated diseases.

Brief summaryIgG antibodies can form hexamers. This study shows that hexamer assembly is an important event determining the ability of IgG to trigger acute lung injury.

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic byproducts of the intestinal microbiota are crucial in maintaining host immune tone and shaping inter-species ecological dynamics. Among these metabolites, succinate is a driver of tuft cell (TC) differentiation and consequent type 2 immunity-dependent protection against invading parasites in the small intestine. Succinate is also a growth enhancer of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile in the large intestine. To date, no research has shown the role of succinate in modulating TC dynamics in the large intestine, or the relevance of this immune pathway to C. difficile pathophysiology. Here we reveal the existence of a three-way circuit between commensal microbes, C. difficile and host epithelial cells which centers around succinate. Through selective microbiota depletion experiments we demonstrate higher levels of type 2 cytokines leading to expansion of TCs in the colon. We then demonstrate the causal role of the microbiome in modulating colonic TC abundance and subsequent type 2 cytokine induction using rational supplementation experiments with fecal transplants and microbial consortia of succinate-producing bacteria. We show that administration of a succinate-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron knockout ({Delta}frd) significantly reduces the enhanced type 2 immunity in mono-colonized mice. Finally, we demonstrate that mice prophylactically administered with the consortium of succinate-producing bacteria show reduced C. difficile-induced morbidity and mortality compared to mice administered with heat-killed bacteria or the vehicle. This effect is reduced in a partial tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3&#43;/-, and nullified in the tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3-/-, confirming that the observed protection occurs via the TC pathway. Succinate is an intermediary metabolite of the production of short-chain fatty acids, and its concentration often increases during dysbiosis. The first barrier to enteric pathogens alike is the intestinal epithelial barrier, and host maintenance and strengthening of barrier integrity is vital to homeostasis. Considering our data, we propose that activation of TC by the microbiota-produced succinate in the colon is a mechanism evolved by the host to counterbalance microbiome-derived cues that facilitate invasion by intestinal pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immune response against Legionella longbeachae, a causative agent of the often-fatal Legionnaires pneumonia, is poorly understood. Here we investigated the specific roles of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (AM) and infiltrating phagocytes during infection with this pathogen. AM were the predominant cell type that phagocytosed bacteria o day after infection. Three and five days after infection, AM numbers were greatly reduced while there was an influx of neutrophils and later monocyte-derived cells (MC) into lung tissue. AM carried greater numbers of viable L. longbeachae than neutrophils and MC, which correlated with a higher capacity of L. longbeachae to translocate bacterial effector proteins required for bacterial replication into the AM cytosol. Cell ablation experiments demonstrated that AM promoted infection whereas neutrophils and MC were required for efficient bacterial clearance. IL-18 was important for IFN-{gamma} production by IL-18R&#43; NK cells and T cells which, in turn, stimulated ROS-mediated bactericidal activity in neutrophils resulting in restriction of L. longbeachae infection. Ciliated epithelial cells also expressed IL-18R but did not play a role in IL-18-mediated L. longbeachae clearance. Our results have identified opposing innate functions of tissue-resident and infiltrating immune cells during L. longbeachae infection that may be manipulated to improve protective responses.

        <p class="abstract">Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus classified by the World Health Organization as a critically important pathogen, posing a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we present the chemical synthesis and evaluation of two semi-synthetic vaccine candidates targeting the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) of C. neoformans. These semi-synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines contain the identical synthetic decasaccharide (M2 motif) antigen. This motif is present in serotype A strains, which constitute 95% of clinical cryptococcosis cases. This synthetic oligosaccharide was conjugated to two proteins (CRM197 and Anthrax 63 kDa PA) and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The conjugates elicited a specific antibody response that bound to the M2 motif but also exhibited additional cross-reactivity towards M1 and M4 GXM motifs. Both glycoconjugates produced antibodies that bound to GXM in ELISA assays and to live fungal cells. Mice immunized with the CRM197 glycoconjugate produced opsonic antibodies and displayed trends toward increased median survival relative to mice given a mock PBS injection (18 vs 15 days, p = 0.06). While these findings indicate promise, achieving a successful vaccine demands further optimization of the glycoconjugate. It could serve as a component in a multi-valent GXM motif vaccine, enhancing both strength and breadth of immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important effectors and modifiers of the acute inflammatory response, recruiting neutrophils to sites of tissue injury. In turn, neutrophils are both consumers and producers of reactive oxygen species. Stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species in an oxidative burst through the activity of a multimeric phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Mutations in the NOX2/CYBB (previously gp91phox) NADPH oxidase subunit are the commonest cause of chronic granulomatous disease, a disease characterized by infection susceptibility and an inflammatory phenotype. To model chronic granulomatous disease, we made a nox2/cybb zebrafish (Danio rerio) mutant and demonstrated it to have severely impaired neutrophil ROS production. Reduced early survival of nox2 mutant embryos indicated an essential requirement for nox2 during early development. In nox2/cybb zebrafish mutants, the dynamics of initial neutrophil recruitment to both mild and severe surgical tailfin wounds was normal, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment at the initiation of inflammation is not the primary cause of the &#34;sterile&#34; inflammatory phenotype of chronic granulomatous disease patients. This nox2 zebrafish mutant adds to existing in vivo models for studying neutrophil reactive oxygen species function in development and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Granulomas are defined by the presence of organized layers of immune cells that include macrophages. Granulomas are often characterized as a way for the immune system to contain an infection and prevent its dissemination. We recently established a mouse infection model where Chromobacterium violaceum induces the innate immune system to form granulomas in the liver. This response successfully eradicates the bacteria and returns the liver to homeostasis. Here, we sought to characterize the chemokines involved in directing immune cells to form the distinct layers of a granuloma. We use spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of all CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors within this granuloma response. The expression profiles change dynamically over space and time as the granuloma matures and then resolves. To investigate the importance of monocyte-derived macrophages in this immune response, we studied the role of CCR2 during C. violaceum infection. Ccr2-/- mice had negligible numbers of macrophages, but large numbers of neutrophils, in the C. violaceum-infected lesions. In addition, lesions had abnormal architecture resulting in loss of bacterial containment. Without CCR2, bacteria disseminated and the mice succumbed to the infection. This indicates that macrophages are critical to form a successful innate granuloma in response to C. violaceum.

Impact statementA successful innate granuloma requires CCR2 to organize the macrophage ring, and without CCR2, mice succumb to Chromobacterium violaceum infection.</p>
