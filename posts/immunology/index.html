Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry and functional assays to investigate the bone marrow NK cell compartment of myeloma patients at diagnosis, during treatment and after relapse. The bone marrow of myeloma patients is characterized by a reduction in conventional cytotoxic NK cells that persists throughout treatment. We show in 20% of newly diagnosed myeloma patients that an altered balance between cytotoxic and cytokine-producing NK cells translates into a reduced cytotoxic ability in response to therapeutic antibodies. The relative loss of cytotoxic NK cells persists at relapse and is accompanied by an expansion of IFN-responsive NK cells. These findings reveal previously unappreciated alterations in bone marrow NK cell composition and highlight the importance of understanding the bone marrow immune system in patients receiving immunotherapies. Statement of significanceThe bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients is characterized by a persistent reduction in cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells, accompanied by inferior in vitro responses to therapeutic antibodies at diagnosis and an increase in IFN-responsive NK cells at relapse. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the BM microenvironment in multiple myeloma patients receiving immunotherapies.\nProteome profiling of nasopharynx reveals pathophysiological signature of COVID-19 disease severity\nAuthors: Ooi, A.; Esau, L. E.; Pugachev, A.; Groen, A.; Sara Mfarrej, R.; Salunke, R. P.; Subudhi, A. K.; Ben-Rached, F.; Alofi, F.; Alsomali, A.; Khogeer, A.; Hashem, A. M.; Almontashiri, N.; Magistretti, P. J.; Hala, S.; Pain, A.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.09.548285\nAn aberrant innate immune system caused by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a characteristic manifestation of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we performed proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 273 hospitalized patients with mild and severe COVID-19 symptoms, including non-survivors. We identified depletion in STAT1-mediated type I interferon response, retinol metabolism and NRF2 antioxidant system that are associated with disease severity in our patient demography. We found that the dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 fatality. Hyperactivation of host innate immune system was observed in severe patients, marked by elevated proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and platelet aggregation. Our study using high-throughput proteomics on the nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients provides additional evidence on the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiological signatures of disease severity and fatality.\nProlonged T cell - DC macro-clustering within lymph node microenvironments initiates Th2 cell differentiation in a site specific manner\nAuthors: Lyons-Cohen, M. R.; Shamskhou, E.; Gerner, M. Y.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547554\nFormation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent macro-clustering at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.\nUtility of nasal swabs for assessing mucosal immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2\nAuthors: Roubidoux, E. K.; Brigleb, P. H.; Vegesana, K.; Souquette, A.; Whitt, K.; Freiden, P.; St. Jude Investigative Team, ; Green, A.; Thomas, P. G.; McGargill, M. A.; Wolf, J.; Schultz-Cherry, S.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548630\nSARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of infections worldwide since its emergence in 2019. Understanding how infection and vaccination induce mucosal immune responses and how they fluctuate over time is important, especially since they are key in preventing infection and reducing disease severity. We established a novel methodology for assessing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine and antibody responses at the nasal epithelium by using nasopharyngeal swabs collected longitudinally before and after either SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We then compared responses between mucosal and systemic compartments. We demonstrate that cytokine and antibody profiles differ markedly between compartments. Nasal cytokines show a wound healing phenotype while plasma cytokines are consistent with pro-inflammatory pathways. We found that nasal IgA and IgG have different kinetics after infection, with IgA peaking first. Although vaccination results in low nasal IgA, IgG induction persists for up to 180 days post-vaccination. This research highlights the importance of studying mucosal responses in addition to systemic responses to respiratory infections to understand the correlates of disease severity and immune memory. The methods described herein can be used to further mucosal vaccine development by giving us a better understanding of immunity at the nasal epithelium providing a simpler, alternative clinical practice to studying mucosal responses to infection.\nIgG sialylation occurs via the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway in endothelial cells\nAuthors: Glendenning, L. M.; Reynero, K. M.; Kukan, E. N.; Long, M. D.; Cobb, B. A.\nScore: 65.7, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547255\nIgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo. One-Sentence SummaryEndothelial cells remodel IgG glycans within the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway.\nYm1 protein crystals promote type 2 immunity\nAuthors: Heyndrickx, I.; Deswarte, K.; Verstraete, K.; Verschueren, K.; Smole, U.; Aegerter, H.; Dansercoer, A.; Hammad, H.; Savvides, S.; Lambrecht, B.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547463\nBackgroundSpontaneous protein crystallization is a rare event, yet needle-shaped protein crystals are frequently found in eosinophil-rich inflammation. In humans, Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) are made from galectin-10 (Gal10) protein, an abundant protein in eosinophils. AimWhereas mice do not encode Gal10 in their genome, they do form pseudo-CLCs, made from the chitinase-like proteins Ym1 and/or Ym2, encoded by Chil3 and Chil4 and made by myeloid and epithelial cells respectively. Here, we investigated the biological effects of pseudo-CLCs since their function is currently unknown. Methods and resultsWe produced recombinant Ym1 crystals which were shown to have identical crystal packing and structure by X-ray crystallography as in vivo native crystals derived from murine lung. When administered to the airways of mice, crystalline but not soluble Ym1 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 immune adjuvant for eosinophilic inflammation via triggering of dendritic cells (DCs). ConclusionMurine Ym1 protein crystals found at sites of eosinophilic inflammation reinforce type 2 immunity and could serve as a surrogate model for studying the biology of human CLCs. eBlurbProtein crystallization is exceedingly rare, yet here, Heyndrickx et al. show that Ym1 crystals made from the chitinase like protein Chil3 promote type 2 immunity in mice.\nHigh-resolution map of the Fc-functions mediated by COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies\nAuthors: Paciello, I.; Maccari, G.; Pantano, E.; Andreano, E.; Rappuoli, R.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548360\nA growing body of evidence shows that Fc-dependent antibody effector functions play an important role in protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To unravel the mechanisms that drive these responses, we analyzed the phagocytosis and complement deposition mediated by a panel of 482 human monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) neutralizing the original Wuhan virus, expressed as recombinant IgG1. Our study confirmed that nAbs no longer neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants can retain their Fc-functions. Surprisingly, we found that nAbs with the most potent Fc-function recognize the N- terminal domain, followed by those targeting Class 3 epitopes in the receptor binding domain. Interestingly, nAbs direct against the Class 1/2 epitopes in the receptor binding motif, which are the most potent in neutralizing the virus, were the weakest in Fc-functions. The divergent properties of the neutralizing and Fc- function mediating antibodies were confirmed by the use of different B cell germlines and by the observation that Fc-functions of polyclonal sera differ from the profile observed with nAbs, suggesting that not-neutralizing antibodies also contribute to Fc-functions. These data provide a high-resolution picture of the Fc-antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that the Fc contribution should be considered for the design of improved vaccines, the selection of therapeutic antibodies and the evaluation of correlates of protection.\nSingle-cell T cell receptor sequencing of paired tissue and blood samples reveals clonal expansion of CD8+ effector T cells in patients with calcific aortic valve disease\nAuthors: Bartoli-Leonard, F.; Chelvanambi, S.; Pham, T.; Turner, M. E.; Blaser, M. C.; Caputo, M.; Aikawa, M.; Pang, A.; Muehlschlegel, J.; Aikawa, E.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.08.548203\nCalcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a complex cardiovascular pathology, culminating in aortic stenosis, heart failure and premature mortality, with no comprehensive treatment strategy, except valve replacement. While T cells have been identified within the valve, their contribution to pathogenesis remains unclear. To elucidate the heterogenous phenotype of the immune populations present within patients with CAVD, deep phenotypic screens of paired valve and peripheral blood cells were conducted via flow cytometry (n=20) and immunohistochemistry (n=10). Following identification of a significant population of memory T cells; specifically, CD8+ T cells within the valve, single cell RNA sequencing and paired single T cell receptor sequencing was conducted on a further 4 patients on CD45+ CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Through unsupervised clustering, 7 T cell populations were identified within the blood and 10 identified within the valve. Tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells were detected for the first time within the valve, exhibiting a highly cytotoxic, activated, and terminally differentiated phenotype. This pan-pro-inflammatory signal was differentially identified in T cells originating from the valve, and not observed in the blood, indicative of an adaptive, local not-systemic inflammatory signature in CAVD patients. T cell receptor analysis identified hyperexpanded clones within the CD8+ T cell central memory (TCM) population, with TRM cells comprising the majority of large and medium clonal expansion within the entire T cell population. Clonal interaction network analysis demonstrated the greatest proportion of clones originating from CD8+ T cell effector memory (TEM) and CD4+ naive / TCM populations and ending in the CD8+ TRM and CD8+ TCM clusters, suggesting a clonal expansion and predicted trajectory of T cells towards a tissue resident, cytotoxic environment within the valve. CDR3 epitope predictive analysis identified 7 potential epitope targets, of which GALNT4 and CR1L have previously been implicated in a cardiovascular context as mediators of inflammation. Taken together, the data identified T cell sub-populations within the context of CAVD and further predicted possible epitopes responsible for the clonal expansion of the valvular T cells, which may be important for propagating inflammation in CAVD.\nNovel co-culture strategies of tumor organoids with autologous T-cells reveal clinically relevant combinations of immune-checkpoint and targeted therapies\nAuthors: Podaza, E.; Capuano, J.; Al Assaad, M.; Kuo, H.-h.; Markowitz, G.; Irizarry, A.; Ravichandran, H.; Ackermann, S.; Kane, T.; Manohar, J.; Sigouros, M.; Moyer, J.; Bhinder, B.; Chandra, P.; Malbari, M.; Boehnke, K.; Mosquera, J. M.; Mittal, V.; Sboner, A.; Gokozan, H.; Altorki, N.; Elemento, O.; Martin, M. L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.546622\nPatient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) have become relevant pre-clinical models for therapeutic modelling since they highly recapitulate patients response to treatment. Nevertheless, their value for immunotherapy modelling has not been fully explored. We developed a tumor processing protocol that enable the establishment of PDTOs and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolation. By the optimization of functional assays, we compared the T-cells effector functions of matching PBMCs and TILs, demonstrating that PBMCs after co-culture and TILs after initial expansion display similar responses. In addition, the evaluation of cytokine production by fluorospot in combination with an image-based killing assay enable the screening of different immune-checkpoint inhibitors as well as its combination with target inhibitors. Our proof-of-concept functional assays showed the potential and versatility of PDTOs and T-cells co-culture systems for immunotherapy screening. The optimization of scalable functional assays downstream co-culture represents a significant step forward to increase the value of PDTOs as pre-clinical models for immunotherapeutic screens.\nCLIPB4 is a central node in the protease network that regulates humoral immunity in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Zhang, S.; Kuang, J.; Sellens, K. A.; Morejon, B.; Saab, S. A.; Metto, E. M.; Li, M.; Osta, M.; An, C.; Culbertson, C. T.; Scoglio, C. M.; Michel, K.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.545904\nInsect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Natural killer (NK) cells mediate the cytotoxic immune response against multiple myeloma and are important effector cells in immune therapies through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry and functional assays to investigate the bone marrow NK cell compartment of myeloma patients at diagnosis, during treatment and after relapse. The bone marrow of myeloma patients is characterized by a reduction in conventional cytotoxic NK cells that persists throughout treatment. We show in 20% of newly diagnosed myeloma patients that an altered balance between cytotoxic and cytokine-producing NK cells translates into a reduced cytotoxic ability in response to therapeutic antibodies. The relative loss of cytotoxic NK cells persists at relapse and is accompanied by an expansion of IFN-responsive NK cells. These findings reveal previously unappreciated alterations in bone marrow NK cell composition and highlight the importance of understanding the bone marrow immune system in patients receiving immunotherapies.

Statement of significanceThe bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients is characterized by a persistent reduction in cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells, accompanied by inferior in vitro responses to therapeutic antibodies at diagnosis and an increase in IFN-responsive NK cells at relapse. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the BM microenvironment in multiple myeloma patients receiving immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An aberrant innate immune system caused by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a characteristic manifestation of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we performed proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 273 hospitalized patients with mild and severe COVID-19 symptoms, including non-survivors. We identified depletion in STAT1-mediated type I interferon response, retinol metabolism and NRF2 antioxidant system that are associated with disease severity in our patient demography. We found that the dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 fatality. Hyperactivation of host innate immune system was observed in severe patients, marked by elevated proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and platelet aggregation. Our study using high-throughput proteomics on the nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients provides additional evidence on the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiological signatures of disease severity and fatality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Formation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent  macro-clustering at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of infections worldwide since its emergence in 2019. Understanding how infection and vaccination induce mucosal immune responses and how they fluctuate over time is important, especially since they are key in preventing infection and reducing disease severity. We established a novel methodology for assessing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine and antibody responses at the nasal epithelium by using nasopharyngeal swabs collected longitudinally before and after either SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We then compared responses between mucosal and systemic compartments. We demonstrate that cytokine and antibody profiles differ markedly between compartments. Nasal cytokines show a wound healing phenotype while plasma cytokines are consistent with pro-inflammatory pathways. We found that nasal IgA and IgG have different kinetics after infection, with IgA peaking first. Although vaccination results in low nasal IgA, IgG induction persists for up to 180 days post-vaccination. This research highlights the importance of studying mucosal responses in addition to systemic responses to respiratory infections to understand the correlates of disease severity and immune memory. The methods described herein can be used to further mucosal vaccine development by giving us a better understanding of immunity at the nasal epithelium providing a simpler, alternative clinical practice to studying mucosal responses to infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSpontaneous protein crystallization is a rare event, yet needle-shaped protein crystals are frequently found in eosinophil-rich inflammation. In humans, Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) are made from galectin-10 (Gal10) protein, an abundant protein in eosinophils.

AimWhereas mice do not encode Gal10 in their genome, they do form pseudo-CLCs, made from the chitinase-like proteins Ym1 and/or Ym2, encoded by Chil3 and Chil4 and made by myeloid and epithelial cells respectively. Here, we investigated the biological effects of pseudo-CLCs since their function is currently unknown.

Methods and resultsWe produced recombinant Ym1 crystals which were shown to have identical crystal packing and structure by X-ray crystallography as in vivo native crystals derived from murine lung. When administered to the airways of mice, crystalline but not soluble Ym1 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 immune adjuvant for eosinophilic inflammation via triggering of dendritic cells (DCs).

ConclusionMurine Ym1 protein crystals found at sites of eosinophilic inflammation reinforce type 2 immunity and could serve as a surrogate model for studying the biology of human CLCs.

eBlurbProtein crystallization is exceedingly rare, yet here, Heyndrickx et al. show that Ym1 crystals made from the chitinase like protein Chil3 promote type 2 immunity in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A growing body of evidence shows that Fc-dependent antibody effector functions play an important role in protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To unravel the mechanisms that drive these responses, we analyzed the phagocytosis and complement deposition mediated by a panel of 482 human monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) neutralizing the original Wuhan virus, expressed as recombinant IgG1. Our study confirmed that nAbs no longer neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants can retain their Fc-functions. Surprisingly, we found that nAbs with the most potent Fc-function recognize the N- terminal domain, followed by those targeting Class 3 epitopes in the receptor binding domain. Interestingly, nAbs direct against the Class 1/2 epitopes in the receptor binding motif, which are the most potent in neutralizing the virus, were the weakest in Fc-functions. The divergent properties of the neutralizing and Fc- function mediating antibodies were confirmed by the use of different B cell germlines and by the observation that Fc-functions of polyclonal sera differ from the profile observed with nAbs, suggesting that not-neutralizing antibodies also contribute to Fc-functions. These data provide a high-resolution picture of the Fc-antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that the Fc contribution should be considered for the design of improved vaccines, the selection of therapeutic antibodies and the evaluation of correlates of protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a complex cardiovascular pathology, culminating in aortic stenosis, heart failure and premature mortality, with no comprehensive treatment strategy, except valve replacement. While T cells have been identified within the valve, their contribution to pathogenesis remains unclear. To elucidate the heterogenous phenotype of the immune populations present within patients with CAVD, deep phenotypic screens of paired valve and peripheral blood cells were conducted via flow cytometry (n=20) and immunohistochemistry (n=10). Following identification of a significant population of memory T cells; specifically, CD8&#43; T cells within the valve, single cell RNA sequencing and paired single T cell receptor sequencing was conducted on a further 4 patients on CD45&#43; CD3&#43;, CD4&#43; or CD8&#43; T cells. Through unsupervised clustering, 7 T cell populations were identified within the blood and 10 identified within the valve. Tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells were detected for the first time within the valve, exhibiting a highly cytotoxic, activated, and terminally differentiated phenotype. This pan-pro-inflammatory signal was differentially identified in T cells originating from the valve, and not observed in the blood, indicative of an adaptive, local not-systemic inflammatory signature in CAVD patients. T cell receptor analysis identified hyperexpanded clones within the CD8&#43; T cell central memory (TCM) population, with TRM cells comprising the majority of large and medium clonal expansion within the entire T cell population. Clonal interaction network analysis demonstrated the greatest proportion of clones originating from CD8&#43; T cell effector memory (TEM) and CD4&#43; naive / TCM populations and ending in the CD8&#43; TRM and CD8&#43; TCM clusters, suggesting a clonal expansion and predicted trajectory of T cells towards a tissue resident, cytotoxic environment within the valve. CDR3 epitope predictive analysis identified 7 potential epitope targets, of which GALNT4 and CR1L have previously been implicated in a cardiovascular context as mediators of inflammation. Taken together, the data identified T cell sub-populations within the context of CAVD and further predicted possible epitopes responsible for the clonal expansion of the valvular T cells, which may be important for propagating inflammation in CAVD.</p>

By the optimization of functional assays, we compared the T-cells effector functions of matching PBMCs and TILs, demonstrating that PBMCs after co-culture and TILs after initial expansion display similar responses. In addition, the evaluation of cytokine production by fluorospot in combination with an image-based killing assay enable the screening of different immune-checkpoint inhibitors as well as its combination with target inhibitors. Our proof-of-concept functional assays showed the potential and versatility of PDTOs and T-cells co-culture systems for immunotherapy screening. The optimization of scalable functional assays downstream co-culture represents a significant step forward to increase the value of PDTOs as pre-clinical models for immunotherapeutic screens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insect humoral immune responses are regulated in part by protease cascades, whose components circulate as zymogens in the hemolymph. In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.</p>
