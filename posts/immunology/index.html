Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.\nRegulation of BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by MIZ1-TIMBIM4 safeguards IgG1+ GC B cell positive selection\nAuthors: Zhang, L.; Toboso-Navasa, A.; Gunawan, A.; Camara, A.; Nakagawa, R.; Finsterbusch, K.; Chakravarty, P.; Newman, R.; Zhang, Y.; Eilers, M.; Wack, A.; Tolar, P.; Toellner, K.-M.; Calado, D. P.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549490\nThe transition from IgM to affinity-matured IgG antibodies is vital for effective humoral immunity. This is facilitated by germinal centers (GCs) through affinity maturation and preferential accumulation of IgG+ B cells over IgM+ B cells. However, it is not known whether the positive selection of the different immunoglobulin isotypes within GCs varies in its dependency on specific transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we identified IgG1+ GC B cell transcription factor dependency using CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional mouse genetics. We found that MIZ1 was specifically required for IgG1+ GC B cell survival during positive selection, whereas IgM+ GC B cells were largely independent. Mechanistically, MIZ1 induced TMBIM4, an ancestral anti-apoptotic protein that regulated inositol trisphosphate receptor mediated Ca2+ mobilization downstream of IgG1. The MIZ1-TMBIM4 axis prevented mitochondrial dysfunction-induced IgG1+ GC cell death caused by excessive Ca2+ accumulation. This study uncovers a unique immunoglobulin isotype-specific dependency, on a hitherto unidentified mechanism in GC positive selection.\nMicroglia at Sites of Atrophy Restrict the Progression of Retinal Degeneration via Galectin-3 and Trem2 Interactions\nAuthors: Yu, C.; Lad, E. M.; Mathew, R.; Littleton, S.; Chen, Y.; Schlepckow, K.; Degan, S.; Chew, L.; Amason, J.; Kalnitsky, J.; Bowes Rickman, C.; Proia, A. D.; Colonna, M.; Haass, C.; Saban, D.\nScore: 12.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549403\nDegenerative diseases of the outer retina, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are characterized by atrophy of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In these blinding diseases, macrophages are known to accumulate ectopically at sites of atrophy, but their ontogeny and functional specialization within this atrophic niche remain poorly understood, especially in the human context. Here, we uncovered a transcriptionally unique profile of microglia, marked by galectin-3 upregulation, at atrophic sites in mouse models of retinal degeneration and in human AMD. Using disease models, we found that conditional deletion of galectin-3 in microglia led to defects in phagocytosis and consequent augmented photoreceptor death, RPE damage and vision loss, suggestive of a protective role. Mechanistically, Trem2 signaling orchestrated the migration of microglial cells to sites of atrophy, and there, induced galectin-3 expression. Moreover, pharmacologic Trem2 agonization led to heightened protection, but only in a galectin-3-dependent manner, further signifying the functional interdependence of these two molecules. Likewise in elderly human subjects, we identified a highly conserved population of microglia at the transcriptomic, protein and spatial levels, and this population was enriched in the macular region of postmortem AMD subjects. Collectively, our findings reveal an atrophy-associated specialization of microglia that restricts the progression of retinal degeneration in mice and further suggest that these protective microglia are conserved in AMD. One Sentence SummaryA common neuroprotective response of microglia at the site of retinal atrophy is identified in mice and humans.\nM2-polarized macrophages prevent preterm birth and improve neonatal survival and immunity\nAuthors: Garcia-Flores, V.; Liu, Z.; Romero, R.; Xu, Y.; Miller, D.; Galaz, J.; Winters, A. D.; Farias-Jofre, M.; Theis, K. R.; Gomez-Lopez, N.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549717\nPreterm birth (PTB), commonly preceded by preterm labor, is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that most cases of preterm labor are associated with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI), an inflammatory condition without detectable microorganisms. To date, no successful strategies to treat SIAI have been developed. Herein, we present mechanistic proof that treatment with M2-polarized macrophages (M2 M{Phi}) can effectively prevent SIAI-induced PTB and neonatal mortality. M2 M{Phi} halt the premature pathway of labor by infiltrating maternal and fetal compartments, where they inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by HMGB1. Furthermore, M2 M{Phi} dampen the HMGB1-induced inflammatory response in the amniotic cavity and fetal lung. Notably, neonates exposed to HMGB1 in utero display a reduced capacity to clear bacterial infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis, which are restored by M2 M{Phi} treatment. Our findings provide cogent evidence that M2 M{Phi} can serve as a cellular strategy to mitigate PTB and decrease neonatal mortality.\nRepeated Omicron exposures override ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting\nAuthors: Yisimayi, A.; Song, W.; Wang, J.; Jian, F.; Yu, Y.; Chen, X.; Xu, Y.; Yang, S.; Niu, X.; Xiao, T.; Wang, J.; Zhao, L.; Sun, H.; An, R.; Zhang, N.; Wang, Y.; Wang, P.; Yu, L.; Lv, Z.; Gu, Q.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Shen, Z.; Wang, Y.; Xie, X. S.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 596.4, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.01.538516\nThe continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.\nPreferential differential gene expression within the WC1.1+ γδ T cell compartment in cattle naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis.\nAuthors: Bhat, S. A.; Elnaggar, M.; Hall, T. J.; McHugo, G.; Reid, C.; MacHugh, D. E.; Meade, K. G.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550071\nBovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in GD T cells- a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. GD T cell subsets are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and function of specific GD T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally M. bovis-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-Gamma ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. GD T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (n = 10-12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1+, WC1.2+, WC1- and GD TCR-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (n = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the M. bovis-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1+ GD T cell compartment (absolute log2 FC \u003e1.5 and FDR Padj. \u003c0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB+ cattle and included genes encoding transcription factors (TBX21 and EOMES), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR7), granzymes (GZMA, GZMM, and GZMH) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1+ GD T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with M. bovis.\nThe T cell receptor sequence influences the likelihood of T cell memory formation\nAuthors: Lagattuta, K. A.; Nathan, A.; Rumker, L.; Birnbaum, M. E.; Raychaudhuri, S.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549939\nT cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.\nPhytohemagglutinin-Activated CAR-T Cells: Prolonged Persistence and Enhanced Anti-Tumor Response in CD19-Specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nAuthors: Sert, B.; Gulden, G.; Teymur, T.; Ay, Y.; Turan, R. D.; Unaldi, O. M.; Guzenge, E.; Erdil, H. E.; Isik, S.; Oz, P.; Bozkurt, I.; Arpaci, T.; Kamali, O.; Ovali, E.; Tarhan, N.; Tastan, C.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.547808\nIn recent times, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown rapid advancements and gained clinical approval for use in cancer immunotherapy. CAR, a synthetic receptor integrated into autologous T cells, has yielded highly successful results in patients with leukemia. The significant potential of CAR-T cells has been validated through clinical trials in adult and pediatric cancer treatments. Our therapy developed specifically for CD19-specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo tests. To enhance the response against cancer, provide a bistimulatory effect, and increase stability, we designed two different CAR structures specific to CD19. These designs incorporate the CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains. Through in vitro analysis, we evaluated the population ratios and cytotoxic activities of Central Memory T cells (TCM) and Stem Cell Memory T cells (TSCM) in CAR-T (CAR1928-T and CAR19BB-T) cells. Our initial design, CAR1928-T, produced an effective anti-tumor response. With our second design, CAR19BB-T, we not only achieved an anti-tumor effect but also conferred memory capabilities, leading to a comprehensive treatment approach. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells produced using Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exhibited increased persistence in vitro and in vivo compared to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. The use of PHA to activate CAR19BB-T cells developed a long-lasting and effective CAR-T cell production method in vivo using cancerous animal models. CAR-T cell-treated mice survived tumor-free for up to 60 days, surpassing the survival of mice that received tumors only. Additionally, CAR19BB-T cell production with PHA remained stable over time. These results highlight a novel CAR-T cell production approach with a high-memory T cell profile capable of delaying or preventing cancer relapse. We optimized the method for the production of long-term and effective CAR-T cells and tested it in preclinical experiments. As a result, it was demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated with PHA, when administered as a co-stimulatory dose, can provide continuous proliferation and long-term persistence without compromising their anti-cancer efficacy. Preclinical studies have been completed to obtain valuable data for enhancing the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials and transitioning to clinical applications.\nMacrophage Xanthine Oxidoreductase Links LPS Induced Lung Inflammatory Injury to NLRP3 Inflammasome Expression and Mitochondrial Respiration\nAuthors: Fini, M. A.; Monks, J. A.; Li, M.; Gerasimovskaya, E.; Paucek, P.; Wang, K.; Frid, M. G.; Pugliese, S. C.; Bratton, D.; Yu, Y.-R.; Irwin, D.; Karin, M.; Wright, R. M.; Stenmark, K. R.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550055\nAcute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remain poorly treated inflammatory lung disorders. Both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an ROS generator that plays a central role in the inflammation that contributes to ALI. To elucidate the role of macrophage-specific XOR in endotoxin induced ALI, we developed a conditional myeloid specific XOR knockout in mice. Myeloid specific ablation of XOR in LPS insufflated mice markedly attenuated lung injury demonstrating the essential role of XOR in this response. Macrophages from myeloid specific XOR knockout exhibited loss of inflammatory activation and increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes/proteins. Transcriptional profiling of whole lung tissue of LPS insufflated XORfl/fl//LysM-Cre mice demonstrated an important role for XOR in expression and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and acquisition of a glycolytic phenotype by inflammatory macrophages. These results identify XOR as an unexpected link between macrophage redox status, mitochondrial respiration and inflammatory activation.\nCARs are organized in nanodomains in the plasma membrane of T cells that accumulate at tumor contact sites\nAuthors: Verbruggen, C.; Gehrke, L.; Banholzer, N.; Ghosh, A.; Reinhard, S.; Weber, J.; Doose, S.; Einsele, H.; Hudecek, M.; Nerreter, T.; Sauer, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549702\nChimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic immune receptors that are expressed in T cells through genetic engineering. CAR-T cells have been successfully used to eradicate very advanced leukemias and lymphomas and their functional properties have been intensively studied. However, relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal expression and organization of CARs on the T-cell membrane and how this influences their efficacy. Here, we applied super-resolution microscopy to visualize CD19-, ROR1-, and ROR2-specific CARs in human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were engineered with lentiviral and transposon-mediated gene transfer. Our data show that the majority of CARs is organized in nanodomains virtually independent of the T cell type, CAR construct and expression level. Quantitative analyses revealed a slightly higher CAR density in transposon-engineered T cells correlating with higher antigen sensitivity and faster resolution of anti-tumor functions compared to lentivirally-engineered T cells. Live-cell fluorescence imaging revealed that both, CAR nanodomains and CAR monomers accumulate at tumor contact sites and form multifocal immunological synapses. Our study provides novel insights into the membrane organization of CARs with single-molecule resolution and illustrates the potential of advanced microscopy to inform the rational design of synthetic immune receptors for applications in immune cell therapy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">More than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transition from IgM to affinity-matured IgG antibodies is vital for effective humoral immunity. This is facilitated by germinal centers (GCs) through affinity maturation and preferential accumulation of IgG&#43; B cells over IgM&#43; B cells. However, it is not known whether the positive selection of the different immunoglobulin isotypes within GCs varies in its dependency on specific transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we identified IgG1&#43; GC B cell transcription factor dependency using CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional mouse genetics. We found that MIZ1 was specifically required for IgG1&#43; GC B cell survival during positive selection, whereas IgM&#43; GC B cells were largely independent. Mechanistically, MIZ1 induced TMBIM4, an ancestral anti-apoptotic protein that regulated inositol trisphosphate receptor mediated Ca2&#43; mobilization downstream of IgG1. The MIZ1-TMBIM4 axis prevented mitochondrial dysfunction-induced IgG1&#43; GC cell death caused by excessive Ca2&#43; accumulation. This study uncovers a unique immunoglobulin isotype-specific dependency, on a hitherto unidentified mechanism in GC positive selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Degenerative diseases of the outer retina, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are characterized by atrophy of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In these blinding diseases, macrophages are known to accumulate ectopically at sites of atrophy, but their ontogeny and functional specialization within this atrophic niche remain poorly understood, especially in the human context. Here, we uncovered a transcriptionally unique profile of microglia, marked by galectin-3 upregulation, at atrophic sites in mouse models of retinal degeneration and in human AMD. Using disease models, we found that conditional deletion of galectin-3 in microglia led to defects in phagocytosis and consequent augmented photoreceptor death, RPE damage and vision loss, suggestive of a protective role.

Mechanistically, Trem2 signaling orchestrated the migration of microglial cells to sites of atrophy, and there, induced galectin-3 expression. Moreover, pharmacologic Trem2 agonization led to heightened protection, but only in a galectin-3-dependent manner, further signifying the functional interdependence of these two molecules. Likewise in elderly human subjects, we identified a highly conserved population of microglia at the transcriptomic, protein and spatial levels, and this population was enriched in the macular region of postmortem AMD subjects. Collectively, our findings reveal an atrophy-associated specialization of microglia that restricts the progression of retinal degeneration in mice and further suggest that these protective microglia are conserved in AMD.

One Sentence SummaryA common neuroprotective response of microglia at the site of retinal atrophy is identified in mice and humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Preterm birth (PTB), commonly preceded by preterm labor, is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed that most cases of preterm labor are associated with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI), an inflammatory condition without detectable microorganisms. To date, no successful strategies to treat SIAI have been developed. Herein, we present mechanistic proof that treatment with M2-polarized macrophages (M2 M{Phi}) can effectively prevent SIAI-induced PTB and neonatal mortality. M2 M{Phi} halt the premature pathway of labor by infiltrating maternal and fetal compartments, where they inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by HMGB1. Furthermore, M2 M{Phi} dampen the HMGB1-induced inflammatory response in the amniotic cavity and fetal lung. Notably, neonates exposed to HMGB1 in utero display a reduced capacity to clear bacterial infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis, which are restored by M2 M{Phi} treatment. Our findings provide cogent evidence that M2 M{Phi} can serve as a cellular strategy to mitigate PTB and decrease neonatal mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The continuous emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants, like XBB.1.51,2 and XBB.1.163,4, highlights the need to update COVID-19 vaccine compositions. However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in GD T cells- a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. GD T cell subsets are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and function of specific GD T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally M. bovis-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-Gamma ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. GD T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (n = 10-12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1&#43;, WC1.2&#43;, WC1- and GD TCR-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (n = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the M. bovis-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1&#43; GD T cell compartment (absolute log2 FC &gt;1.5 and FDR Padj. &lt;0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB&#43; cattle and included genes encoding transcription factors (TBX21 and EOMES), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR7), granzymes (GZMA, GZMM, and GZMH) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1&#43; GD T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with M. bovis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent times, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown rapid advancements and gained clinical approval for use in cancer immunotherapy. CAR, a synthetic receptor integrated into autologous T cells, has yielded highly successful results in patients with leukemia. The significant potential of CAR-T cells has been validated through clinical trials in adult and pediatric cancer treatments. Our therapy developed specifically for CD19-specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo tests. To enhance the response against cancer, provide a bistimulatory effect, and increase stability, we designed two different CAR structures specific to CD19. These designs incorporate the CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains. Through in vitro analysis, we evaluated the population ratios and cytotoxic activities of Central Memory T cells (TCM) and Stem Cell Memory T cells (TSCM) in CAR-T (CAR1928-T and CAR19BB-T) cells. Our initial design, CAR1928-T, produced an effective anti-tumor response. With our second design, CAR19BB-T, we not only achieved an anti-tumor effect but also conferred memory capabilities, leading to a comprehensive treatment approach. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells produced using Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exhibited increased persistence in vitro and in vivo compared to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. The use of PHA to activate CAR19BB-T cells developed a long-lasting and effective CAR-T cell production method in vivo using cancerous animal models. CAR-T cell-treated mice survived tumor-free for up to 60 days, surpassing the survival of mice that received tumors only. Additionally, CAR19BB-T cell production with PHA remained stable over time. These results highlight a novel CAR-T cell production approach with a high-memory T cell profile capable of delaying or preventing cancer relapse. We optimized the method for the production of long-term and effective CAR-T cells and tested it in preclinical experiments. As a result, it was demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated with PHA, when administered as a co-stimulatory dose, can provide continuous proliferation and long-term persistence without compromising their anti-cancer efficacy. Preclinical studies have been completed to obtain valuable data for enhancing the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials and transitioning to clinical applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remain poorly treated inflammatory lung disorders. Both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an ROS generator that plays a central role in the inflammation that contributes to ALI. To elucidate the role of macrophage-specific XOR in endotoxin induced ALI, we developed a conditional myeloid specific XOR knockout in mice. Myeloid specific ablation of XOR in LPS insufflated mice markedly attenuated lung injury demonstrating the essential role of XOR in this response. Macrophages from myeloid specific XOR knockout exhibited loss of inflammatory activation and increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes/proteins. Transcriptional profiling of whole lung tissue of LPS insufflated XORfl/fl//LysM-Cre mice demonstrated an important role for XOR in expression and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and acquisition of a glycolytic phenotype by inflammatory macrophages. These results identify XOR as an unexpected link between macrophage redox status, mitochondrial respiration and inflammatory activation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic immune receptors that are expressed in T cells through genetic engineering. CAR-T cells have been successfully used to eradicate very advanced leukemias and lymphomas and their functional properties have been intensively studied. However, relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal expression and organization of CARs on the T-cell membrane and how this influences their efficacy. Here, we applied super-resolution microscopy to visualize CD19-, ROR1-, and ROR2-specific CARs in human CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells that were engineered with lentiviral and transposon-mediated gene transfer. Our data show that the majority of CARs is organized in nanodomains virtually independent of the T cell type, CAR construct and expression level. Quantitative analyses revealed a slightly higher CAR density in transposon-engineered T cells correlating with higher antigen sensitivity and faster resolution of anti-tumor functions compared to lentivirally-engineered T cells. Live-cell fluorescence imaging revealed that both, CAR nanodomains and CAR monomers accumulate at tumor contact sites and form multifocal immunological synapses. Our study provides novel insights into the membrane organization of CARs with single-molecule resolution and illustrates the potential of advanced microscopy to inform the rational design of synthetic immune receptors for applications in immune cell therapy.</p>
