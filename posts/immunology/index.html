S.\nScore: 65.9, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.578771\nThe rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.\nEndosomal LRBA regulates the endo-lysosomal pathway\nAuthors: Szentgyoergyi, V.; Lueck, L. M.; Overwijn, D.; Zoeller, N. N.; Hondele, M.; Spang, A.; Bakhtiar, S.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579084\nDeleterious mutations in the LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide Responsive Beige-like Anchor protein) gene cause severe childhood immune dysregulation. The clinical manifestations of LRBA deficiency syndrome are highly variable. Thus, the complexity of the symptoms involving multiple organs and the broad range of unpredictable clinical manifestations complicate the choice of therapeutic interventions. Although LRBA has been linked to Rab11-dependent trafficking of the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, its precise cellular role remains elusive. We show that LRBA, however, does not colocalize with Rab11. Instead, LRBA is recruited by members of the small GTPase Arf protein family to the TGN and to Rab4+ endosomes, where it controls intracellular traffic. In patient-derived fibroblasts, loss of LRBA led to defects in the endosomal pathway yielding the accumulation of enlarged endolysosomes. Thus, LRBA appears to regulate flow through the endosomal system on Rab4+ endosomes. Our data strongly suggest functions of LRBA beyond CTLA-4 trafficking and provide a conceptual framework to develop new therapies for LRBA deficiency. SummaryLRBA-deficient patients exhibit enlarged functional endolysosomes due to defects in recycling to the plasma membrane. LRBA localization on Rab4+ endosomes depends on Arf1 and Arf3, and is essential for a functional endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Our results could inform new treatment options.\nSemi-synthetic glycoconjugate vaccine candidate against Cryptococcus neoformans\nAuthors: Crawford, C. J.; Liporagi-Lopes, L.; Coelho, C.; Santos Junior, S. R.; Nicola, A. M.; Wear, M. P.; Oscarson, S.; Casadevall, A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578725\nCryptococcus neoformans is a fungus classified by the World Health Organization as a critically important pathogen, posing a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we present the chemical synthesis and evaluation of two semi-synthetic vaccine candidates targeting the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) of C. neoformans. These semi-synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines contain the identical synthetic decasaccharide (M2 motif) antigen. This motif is present in serotype A strains, which constitute 95% of clinical cryptococcosis cases. This synthetic oligosaccharide was conjugated to two proteins (CRM197 and Anthrax 63 kDa PA) and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The conjugates elicited a specific antibody response that bound to the M2 motif but also exhibited additional cross-reactivity towards M1 and M4 GXM motifs. Both glycoconjugates produced antibodies that bound to GXM in ELISA assays and to live fungal cells. Mice immunized with the CRM197 glycoconjugate produced opsonic antibodies and displayed trends toward increased median survival relative to mice given a mock PBS injection (18 vs 15 days, p = 0.06). While these findings indicate promise, achieving a successful vaccine demands further optimization of the glycoconjugate. It could serve as a component in a multi-valent GXM motif vaccine, enhancing both strength and breadth of immune responses.\nTamm-Horsfall protein augments neutrophil NETosis during urinary tract infection\nAuthors: Mercado-Evans, V.; Chew, C.; Serchejian, C.; Saltzman, A.; Mejia, M.; Zulk, J.; Cornax, I.; Nizet, V.; Patras, K.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578501\nUrinary neutrophils are a hallmark of urinary tract infection (UTI), yet the mechanisms governing their activation, function, and efficacy in controlling infection remain incompletely understood. Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), the most abundant protein in urine, uses terminal sialic acids to bind an inhibitory receptor and dampen neutrophil inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that neutrophil modulation is an integral part of THP-mediated host protection. In a UTI model, THP-deficient mice showed elevated urinary tract bacterial burdens, increased neutrophil recruitment, and more severe tissue histopathological changes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, THP-deficient mice displayed impaired urinary NETosis during UTI. To investigate the impact of THP on NETosis, we coupled in vitro fluorescence-based NET assays, proteomic analyses, and standard and imaging flow cytometry with peripheral human neutrophils. We found that THP increases proteins involved in respiratory chain, neutrophil granules, and chromatin remodeling pathways, enhances NETosis in an ROS-dependent manner, and drives NET-associated morphologic features including nuclear decondensation. These effects were observed only in the presence of a NETosis stimulus and could not be solely replicated with equivalent levels of sialic acid alone. We conclude that THP is a critical regulator of NETosis in the urinary tract, playing a key role in host defense against UTI.\nA nox2 / cybb zebrafish mutant with defective neutrophil ROS production displays normal initial neutrophil recruitment to sterile tail injuries\nAuthors: Lieschke, G. J.; Isiaku, A. I.; Zhang, Z.; Pazhakh, V.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578645\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are important effectors and modifiers of the acute inflammatory response, recruiting neutrophils to sites of tissue injury. In turn, neutrophils are both consumers and producers of reactive oxygen species. Stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species in an oxidative burst through the activity of a multimeric phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Mutations in the NOX2/CYBB (previously gp91phox) NADPH oxidase subunit are the commonest cause of chronic granulomatous disease, a disease characterized by infection susceptibility and an inflammatory phenotype. To model chronic granulomatous disease, we made a nox2/cybb zebrafish (Danio rerio) mutant and demonstrated it to have severely impaired neutrophil ROS production. Reduced early survival of nox2 mutant embryos indicated an essential requirement for nox2 during early development. In nox2/cybb zebrafish mutants, the dynamics of initial neutrophil recruitment to both mild and severe surgical tailfin wounds was normal, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment at the initiation of inflammation is not the primary cause of the \"sterile\" inflammatory phenotype of chronic granulomatous disease patients. This nox2 zebrafish mutant adds to existing in vivo models for studying neutrophil reactive oxygen species function in development and disease.\nMicrobiota encoded fatty-acid metabolism expands tuft cells to protect tissues homeostasis during Clostridioides difficile infection in the large intestine\nAuthors: Kellogg, T. D.; Ceglia, S.; Mortzfeld, B. M.; Zeamer, A. L.; Foley, S. E.; Ward, D.; Bhattarai, S. K.; McCormick, B. A.; Reboldi, A.; Bucci, V.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.574039\nMetabolic byproducts of the intestinal microbiota are crucial in maintaining host immune tone and shaping inter-species ecological dynamics. Among these metabolites, succinate is a driver of tuft cell (TC) differentiation and consequent type 2 immunity-dependent protection against invading parasites in the small intestine. Succinate is also a growth enhancer of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile in the large intestine. To date, no research has shown the role of succinate in modulating TC dynamics in the large intestine, or the relevance of this immune pathway to C. difficile pathophysiology. Here we reveal the existence of a three-way circuit between commensal microbes, C. difficile and host epithelial cells which centers around succinate. Through selective microbiota depletion experiments we demonstrate higher levels of type 2 cytokines leading to expansion of TCs in the colon. We then demonstrate the causal role of the microbiome in modulating colonic TC abundance and subsequent type 2 cytokine induction using rational supplementation experiments with fecal transplants and microbial consortia of succinate-producing bacteria. We show that administration of a succinate-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron knockout ({Delta}frd) significantly reduces the enhanced type 2 immunity in mono-colonized mice. Finally, we demonstrate that mice prophylactically administered with the consortium of succinate-producing bacteria show reduced C. difficile-induced morbidity and mortality compared to mice administered with heat-killed bacteria or the vehicle. This effect is reduced in a partial tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3+/-, and nullified in the tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3-/-, confirming that the observed protection occurs via the TC pathway. Succinate is an intermediary metabolite of the production of short-chain fatty acids, and its concentration often increases during dysbiosis. The first barrier to enteric pathogens alike is the intestinal epithelial barrier, and host maintenance and strengthening of barrier integrity is vital to homeostasis. Considering our data, we propose that activation of TC by the microbiota-produced succinate in the colon is a mechanism evolved by the host to counterbalance microbiome-derived cues that facilitate invasion by intestinal pathogens.\nIdentification and Structural Characterization of a mutant KRAS-G12V specific TCR restricted by HLA-A3\nAuthors: Sim, M. J. W.; Hanada, K.-i.; Stotz, Z. S.; Yu, Z.; Lu, J.; Brennan, P.; Quastel, M.; Gillespie, G.; Long, E. O.; Yang, J. C.; Sun, P. D.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578367\nMutations in KRAS are some of the most common across multiple cancer types and are thus attractive targets for therapy. Recent studies demonstrated that mutant KRAS generates immunogenic neoantigens that can be targeted in adoptive T cell therapy in metastatic diseases. To expand mutant KRAS specific immunotherapies, it is critical to identify additional HLA-I allotypes that can present KRAS neoantigens and their cognate T cell receptors (TCR). Here, we identified a murine TCR specific to a KRAS-G12V neoantigen (7VVVGAVGVGK16) using a vaccination approach with transgenic mice expressing the common HLA-I allotype, HLA-A*03:01 (HLA-A3). This TCR demonstrated exquisite specificity for mutant G12V and not WT KRAS peptides. To investigate the molecular basis for neoantigen recognition by this TCR, we determined its structure in complex with HLA-A3(G12V). G12V-TCR CDR3{beta} and CDR1{beta} formed a hydrophobic pocket to interact with p6 Val of the G12V but not WT KRAS peptide. To improve the tumor sensitivity of this TCR, we designed rational substitutions to improve TCR:HLA-A3 contacts. Two substitutions exhibited modest improvements in TCR binding to HLA-A3 (G12V), but did not sufficiently improve T cell sensitivity for further clinical development. Our study provides mechanistic insight into how TCRs detect neoantigens and reveals the challenges in targeting KRAS-G12V mutations.\nSystematic Analysis of Immune Changes after B-cell Depletion in Autoimmune Multiple Sclerosis\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Moon, J.; Yasumizu, Y.; Zhang, L.; Radassi, K.; Buitrago-Pocasangre, N.; Deerhake, M. E.; Strauli, N.; Chan, A.; Herman, A.; Pedotte, R.; Raposo, C.; Tackenberg, B.; Yim, I.; Pappalardo, J.; Longbrake, E. E.; Sumida, T. S.; Axisa, P.-P.; Hafler, D. A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.576204\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how a therapy-driven \"in vivo perturbation\" modulates the diverse immune landscape by measuring transcriptomic granularity with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. In addition, we observed increases in TNFa messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFa treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion also induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different mechanisms of action contributing to the high efficacy in B cell depletion treatment of MS.\nREL2 overexpression in the Anopheles gambiae midgut causes major transcriptional changes but fails to induce an immune response\nAuthors: Hoermann, A.; Capriotti, P.; Del Corsano, G.; Inghilterra, M. G.; Habtewold, T.; Cai, J. A.; Saini, G. S.; Nguyen, H.; Windbichler, N.; Christophides, G. K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578852\nThe NF-{kappa}B-like transcription factor, REL2, is a key player in the mosquito Immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway and holds promise for controlling malaria parasite infections in genetically modified Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We engineered transgenic mosquitoes overexpressing REL2 from within the bloodmeal-inducible zinc carboxypeptidase A1 (CP) host gene in the adult posterior midgut. Our results confirmed elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut following a bloodmeal, with the corresponding protein localized within epithelial cell nuclei. While this induced overexpression triggered substantial transcriptional changes, accompanied by notable fitness costs, the resultant reduction in Plasmodium falciparum infection was modest. An in-depth analysis of regulatory regions of differentially regulated genes allowed us to identify direct REL2 target genes and revealed signatures indicative of potential transcriptional repressors. To account for potential impacts of host gene modification, we also created a CP knockout line that caused marginal effects on mosquito fitness. These findings shed light on the observed absence of transcriptional activation and, in some cases, induced repression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) presumed to be under Imd pathway control. In conclusion, our study suggests that elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut may induce the upregulation of negative immune regulators, facilitating control over an otherwise unrestrained immune response, and that concurrent transcriptional derepression may be needed to effectively induce the mosquito immune response. This work contributes valuable insights into the intricate regulation of midgut immunity in malaria vector mosquitoes.\nComplement-Activating Multimeric Immunotherapeutic Complexes for HER2-breast cancer immunotherapy\nAuthors: Seguin-Devaux, C.; Brandus, B.; Plesseria, J.-M.; Iserentant, G.; Servais, J.-Y.; Kanli, G.; Behrmann, I.; Zimmer, J.; COHEN, J. H.; Dervillez, X.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578619\nBackgroundDirecting selective complement activation towards tumor cells is an attractive strategy to promote their elimination. We have generated Complement-activating Multimeric immunotherapeutic compleXes (CoMiX) that selectively stimulate the alternative pathway using Factor H Related protein 4 (FHR4) or the classical complement pathways using triple Fc dimers on HER2-expressing tumor cells. MethodsWe used the C4bp C-terminal--/{beta}-chain multimerising scaffolds to generate CoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX-Fc with 2 different VHH anti-HER2, VHH(T) and VHH(P), recognising trastuzumab-or pertuzumab-competing HER2 epitopes, respectively: FHR4/VHH(T), FHR4/VHH(P), VHH(T)/Fc, VHH(P)/Fc. The different CoMiX were compared in vitro for C3b and C5b9 depositions, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and their ability to activate NK cells and phagocytosis by macrophages using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukeys tests. We further explored their therapeutic efficacy in vivo on human BT474 breast cancer xenografts established in NUDE mice, when used individually or in combination, as compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab. ResultsFHR4/VHH(T) and FHR4/VHH(P) led to the highest C3b and C5b9 depositions and CDC, both individually and in combinations on BT474 tumor cells (p\u003c 0.0001) surpassing the very low complement activating capacity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. CoMiX-Fc showed NK cell activation and complement-mediated BT474 phagocytosis by M2 macrophages. In the xenograft model, CoMiX-FHR4 molecules reduced the tumor volume by a factor of 7.33 compared to the PBS control. VHH(T)/Fc had no effect on tumor growth, while VHH(P)/Fc led to a 2.75-times tumor volume reduction that was higher than pertuzumab (p\u003c 0.01). Trastuzumab and its combination with pertuzumab remained the most potent regimen, alone or in combination, to completely inhibit tumor growth. CoMiX-FHR4, CoMiX-Fc and C3b deposition were visualized as soon as one hour after injection resulting in a massive homogeneous complement deposit 6 hours after injection. Interestingly, CoMiX-FHR4 significantly reduced the growth of trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells in contrast to trastuzumab and induced a large NK cell infiltration into the tumor. ConclusionsCoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX VHH(P)/Fc significantly inhibit tumor growth through complement activation, NK cells infiltration, and phagocytosis by macrophages. CoMiX-FHR4 proteins delay xenograft growth of BT474 cells resistant to trastuzumab and could thus be an attractive approach when resistance to antibody emerges. Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSComplement activation represents a substantial part of the overall biological activity of few therapeutic antibodies used in cancer immunotherapy. Factor H-related protein 4 can activate complement by serving as a platform for the assembly of alternative pathway C3 convertase by competing with factor H for C3b binding. We previously showed that multimeric recombinant proteins displaying the FHR4 complement effector moiety and a nanobody anti-HER2 targeting moiety selectively direct the activation of the complement alternative pathway on HER2-expressing tumor cells, leading to subsequent cell destruction through direct cell lysis or through the activation of host effector cells. What this study addsWe used in the current work a novel complement-directed tumor cell distruction strategy in vivo. We showed that CoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX-Fc (based on triple Fc dimers), targeting HER2-positive breast tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth in a model of BT474 xenograft in NUDE mice by stimulating complement activation, BT474 death, NK cell activation, and phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages. CoMiX-FHR4 remain efficient in xenografts of BT474 cells resistant to trastuzumab. How this study might affect research, practice or policyWe demonstrate for the first time that directed complement activation on tumor cells is an alternative to therapeutic antibodies which is particularly promising when resistance to standard-of-care treatment occurs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deleterious mutations in the LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide Responsive Beige-like Anchor protein) gene cause severe childhood immune dysregulation. The clinical manifestations of LRBA deficiency syndrome are highly variable. Thus, the complexity of the symptoms involving multiple organs and the broad range of unpredictable clinical manifestations complicate the choice of therapeutic interventions. Although LRBA has been linked to Rab11-dependent trafficking of the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, its precise cellular role remains elusive. We show that LRBA, however, does not colocalize with Rab11. Instead, LRBA is recruited by members of the small GTPase Arf protein family to the TGN and to Rab4&#43; endosomes, where it controls intracellular traffic. In patient-derived fibroblasts, loss of LRBA led to defects in the endosomal pathway yielding the accumulation of enlarged endolysosomes. Thus, LRBA appears to regulate flow through the endosomal system on Rab4&#43; endosomes. Our data strongly suggest functions of LRBA beyond CTLA-4 trafficking and provide a conceptual framework to develop new therapies for LRBA deficiency.

SummaryLRBA-deficient patients exhibit enlarged functional endolysosomes due to defects in recycling to the plasma membrane. LRBA localization on Rab4&#43; endosomes depends on Arf1 and Arf3, and is essential for a functional endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Our results could inform new treatment options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus classified by the World Health Organization as a critically important pathogen, posing a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we present the chemical synthesis and evaluation of two semi-synthetic vaccine candidates targeting the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) of C. neoformans. These semi-synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines contain the identical synthetic decasaccharide (M2 motif) antigen. This motif is present in serotype A strains, which constitute 95% of clinical cryptococcosis cases. This synthetic oligosaccharide was conjugated to two proteins (CRM197 and Anthrax 63 kDa PA) and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The conjugates elicited a specific antibody response that bound to the M2 motif but also exhibited additional cross-reactivity towards M1 and M4 GXM motifs. Both glycoconjugates produced antibodies that bound to GXM in ELISA assays and to live fungal cells. Mice immunized with the CRM197 glycoconjugate produced opsonic antibodies and displayed trends toward increased median survival relative to mice given a mock PBS injection (18 vs 15 days, p = 0.06). While these findings indicate promise, achieving a successful vaccine demands further optimization of the glycoconjugate. It could serve as a component in a multi-valent GXM motif vaccine, enhancing both strength and breadth of immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urinary neutrophils are a hallmark of urinary tract infection (UTI), yet the mechanisms governing their activation, function, and efficacy in controlling infection remain incompletely understood. Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), the most abundant protein in urine, uses terminal sialic acids to bind an inhibitory receptor and dampen neutrophil inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that neutrophil modulation is an integral part of THP-mediated host protection. In a UTI model, THP-deficient mice showed elevated urinary tract bacterial burdens, increased neutrophil recruitment, and more severe tissue histopathological changes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, THP-deficient mice displayed impaired urinary NETosis during UTI. To investigate the impact of THP on NETosis, we coupled in vitro fluorescence-based NET assays, proteomic analyses, and standard and imaging flow cytometry with peripheral human neutrophils. We found that THP increases proteins involved in respiratory chain, neutrophil granules, and chromatin remodeling pathways, enhances NETosis in an ROS-dependent manner, and drives NET-associated morphologic features including nuclear decondensation. These effects were observed only in the presence of a NETosis stimulus and could not be solely replicated with equivalent levels of sialic acid alone. We conclude that THP is a critical regulator of NETosis in the urinary tract, playing a key role in host defense against UTI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important effectors and modifiers of the acute inflammatory response, recruiting neutrophils to sites of tissue injury. In turn, neutrophils are both consumers and producers of reactive oxygen species. Stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species in an oxidative burst through the activity of a multimeric phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Mutations in the NOX2/CYBB (previously gp91phox) NADPH oxidase subunit are the commonest cause of chronic granulomatous disease, a disease characterized by infection susceptibility and an inflammatory phenotype. To model chronic granulomatous disease, we made a nox2/cybb zebrafish (Danio rerio) mutant and demonstrated it to have severely impaired neutrophil ROS production. Reduced early survival of nox2 mutant embryos indicated an essential requirement for nox2 during early development. In nox2/cybb zebrafish mutants, the dynamics of initial neutrophil recruitment to both mild and severe surgical tailfin wounds was normal, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment at the initiation of inflammation is not the primary cause of the &#34;sterile&#34; inflammatory phenotype of chronic granulomatous disease patients. This nox2 zebrafish mutant adds to existing in vivo models for studying neutrophil reactive oxygen species function in development and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic byproducts of the intestinal microbiota are crucial in maintaining host immune tone and shaping inter-species ecological dynamics. Among these metabolites, succinate is a driver of tuft cell (TC) differentiation and consequent type 2 immunity-dependent protection against invading parasites in the small intestine. Succinate is also a growth enhancer of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile in the large intestine. To date, no research has shown the role of succinate in modulating TC dynamics in the large intestine, or the relevance of this immune pathway to C. difficile pathophysiology. Here we reveal the existence of a three-way circuit between commensal microbes, C. difficile and host epithelial cells which centers around succinate. Through selective microbiota depletion experiments we demonstrate higher levels of type 2 cytokines leading to expansion of TCs in the colon. We then demonstrate the causal role of the microbiome in modulating colonic TC abundance and subsequent type 2 cytokine induction using rational supplementation experiments with fecal transplants and microbial consortia of succinate-producing bacteria. We show that administration of a succinate-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron knockout ({Delta}frd) significantly reduces the enhanced type 2 immunity in mono-colonized mice. Finally, we demonstrate that mice prophylactically administered with the consortium of succinate-producing bacteria show reduced C. difficile-induced morbidity and mortality compared to mice administered with heat-killed bacteria or the vehicle. This effect is reduced in a partial tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3&#43;/-, and nullified in the tuft cell knockout mouse, Pou2f3-/-, confirming that the observed protection occurs via the TC pathway. Succinate is an intermediary metabolite of the production of short-chain fatty acids, and its concentration often increases during dysbiosis. The first barrier to enteric pathogens alike is the intestinal epithelial barrier, and host maintenance and strengthening of barrier integrity is vital to homeostasis. Considering our data, we propose that activation of TC by the microbiota-produced succinate in the colon is a mechanism evolved by the host to counterbalance microbiome-derived cues that facilitate invasion by intestinal pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in KRAS are some of the most common across multiple cancer types and are thus attractive targets for therapy. Recent studies demonstrated that mutant KRAS generates immunogenic neoantigens that can be targeted in adoptive T cell therapy in metastatic diseases. To expand mutant KRAS specific immunotherapies, it is critical to identify additional HLA-I allotypes that can present KRAS neoantigens and their cognate T cell receptors (TCR). Here, we identified a murine TCR specific to a KRAS-G12V neoantigen (7VVVGAVGVGK16) using a vaccination approach with transgenic mice expressing the common HLA-I allotype, HLA-A*03:01 (HLA-A3). This TCR demonstrated exquisite specificity for mutant G12V and not WT KRAS peptides. To investigate the molecular basis for neoantigen recognition by this TCR, we determined its structure in complex with HLA-A3(G12V). G12V-TCR CDR3{beta} and CDR1{beta} formed a hydrophobic pocket to interact with p6 Val of the G12V but not WT KRAS peptide. To improve the tumor sensitivity of this TCR, we designed rational substitutions to improve TCR:HLA-A3 contacts. Two substitutions exhibited modest improvements in TCR binding to HLA-A3 (G12V), but did not sufficiently improve T cell sensitivity for further clinical development. Our study provides mechanistic insight into how TCRs detect neoantigens and reveals the challenges in targeting KRAS-G12V mutations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how a therapy-driven &#34;in vivo perturbation&#34; modulates the diverse immune landscape by measuring transcriptomic granularity with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16&#43; monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. In addition, we observed increases in TNFa messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFa treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion also induced changes in peripheral CD4&#43; T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT&#43; regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4&#43; T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different mechanisms of action contributing to the high efficacy in B cell depletion treatment of MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The NF-{kappa}B-like transcription factor, REL2, is a key player in the mosquito Immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway and holds promise for controlling malaria parasite infections in genetically modified Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We engineered transgenic mosquitoes overexpressing REL2 from within the bloodmeal-inducible zinc carboxypeptidase A1 (CP) host gene in the adult posterior midgut. Our results confirmed elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut following a bloodmeal, with the corresponding protein localized within epithelial cell nuclei. While this induced overexpression triggered substantial transcriptional changes, accompanied by notable fitness costs, the resultant reduction in Plasmodium falciparum infection was modest. An in-depth analysis of regulatory regions of differentially regulated genes allowed us to identify direct REL2 target genes and revealed signatures indicative of potential transcriptional repressors. To account for potential impacts of host gene modification, we also created a CP knockout line that caused marginal effects on mosquito fitness. These findings shed light on the observed absence of transcriptional activation and, in some cases, induced repression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) presumed to be under Imd pathway control. In conclusion, our study suggests that elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut may induce the upregulation of negative immune regulators, facilitating control over an otherwise unrestrained immune response, and that concurrent transcriptional derepression may be needed to effectively induce the mosquito immune response. This work contributes valuable insights into the intricate regulation of midgut immunity in malaria vector mosquitoes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDirecting selective complement activation towards tumor cells is an attractive strategy to promote their elimination. We have generated Complement-activating Multimeric immunotherapeutic compleXes (CoMiX) that selectively stimulate the alternative pathway using Factor H Related protein 4 (FHR4) or the classical complement pathways using triple Fc dimers on HER2-expressing tumor cells.

MethodsWe used the C4bp C-terminal--/{beta}-chain multimerising scaffolds to generate CoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX-Fc with 2 different VHH anti-HER2, VHH(T) and VHH(P), recognising trastuzumab-or pertuzumab-competing HER2 epitopes, respectively: FHR4/VHH(T), FHR4/VHH(P), VHH(T)/Fc, VHH(P)/Fc. The different CoMiX were compared in vitro for C3b and C5b9 depositions, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and their ability to activate NK cells and phagocytosis by macrophages using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukeys tests. We further explored their therapeutic efficacy in vivo on human BT474 breast cancer xenografts established in NUDE mice, when used individually or in combination, as compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab.

ResultsFHR4/VHH(T) and FHR4/VHH(P) led to the highest C3b and C5b9 depositions and CDC, both individually and in combinations on BT474 tumor cells (p&lt; 0.0001) surpassing the very low complement activating capacity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. CoMiX-Fc showed NK cell activation and complement-mediated BT474 phagocytosis by M2 macrophages. In the xenograft model, CoMiX-FHR4 molecules reduced the tumor volume by a factor of 7.33 compared to the PBS control. VHH(T)/Fc had no effect on tumor growth, while VHH(P)/Fc led to a 2.75-times tumor volume reduction that was higher than pertuzumab (p&lt; 0.01). Trastuzumab and its combination with pertuzumab remained the most potent regimen, alone or in combination, to completely inhibit tumor growth. CoMiX-FHR4, CoMiX-Fc and C3b deposition were visualized as soon as one hour after injection resulting in a massive homogeneous complement deposit 6 hours after injection. Interestingly, CoMiX-FHR4 significantly reduced the growth of trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells in contrast to trastuzumab and induced a large NK cell infiltration into the tumor.

ConclusionsCoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX VHH(P)/Fc significantly inhibit tumor growth through complement activation, NK cells infiltration, and phagocytosis by macrophages. CoMiX-FHR4 proteins delay xenograft growth of BT474 cells resistant to trastuzumab and could thus be an attractive approach when resistance to antibody emerges.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSComplement activation represents a substantial part of the overall biological activity of few therapeutic antibodies used in cancer immunotherapy. Factor H-related protein 4 can activate complement by serving as a platform for the assembly of alternative pathway C3 convertase by competing with factor H for C3b binding. We previously showed that multimeric recombinant proteins displaying the FHR4 complement effector moiety and a nanobody anti-HER2 targeting moiety selectively direct the activation of the complement alternative pathway on HER2-expressing tumor cells, leading to subsequent cell destruction through direct cell lysis or through the activation of host effector cells.

What this study addsWe used in the current work a novel complement-directed tumor cell distruction strategy in vivo. We showed that CoMiX-FHR4 and CoMiX-Fc (based on triple Fc dimers), targeting HER2-positive breast tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth in a model of BT474 xenograft in NUDE mice by stimulating complement activation, BT474 death, NK cell activation, and phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages. CoMiX-FHR4 remain efficient in xenografts of BT474 cells resistant to trastuzumab.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyWe demonstrate for the first time that directed complement activation on tumor cells is an alternative to therapeutic antibodies which is particularly promising when resistance to standard-of-care treatment occurs.</p>
