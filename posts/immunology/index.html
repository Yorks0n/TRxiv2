R.\nScore: 621.9, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555815\nThe recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant, BA.2.86, which carries a substantial number of Spike mutations, has raised a global alarm. An immediate assessment of its antigenic properties and infectivity is necessary. Here, we reveal the distinct antigenicity of BA.2.86 compared with previous variants including XBB.1.5. BA.2.86 significantly evades convalescent plasma from XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfections. Key mutations that mediate the enhanced resistance include N450D, K356T, L452W, A484K, V483del, and V445H on the RBD, while BA.2.86s NTD mutations and E554K on SD1 also largely contribute. However, we found that BA.2.86 pseudovirus exhibits compromised efficiency of infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells compared to XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which may be caused by K356T, V483del, and E554K, and could potentially limit BA.2.86s transmissibility. In sum, it appears that BA.2.86 has traded its infectivity for higher immune evasion during long-term host-viral evolution. Close attention should be paid to monitoring additional mutations that could improve BA.2.86s infectivity.\nSensitivity of BA.2.86 to prevailing neutralising antibody responses\nAuthors: Sheward, D. J.; Yang, Y.; Westerberg, M.; Öling, S.; Muschiol, S.; Sato, K.; Peacock, T. P.; Karlsson Hedestam, G. B.; Albert, J.; Murrell, B.\nScore: 816.8, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556033\nA new SARS-CoV-2 variant, designated BA.2.86, has recently emerged with over 30 spike mutations relative to its parental BA.2, raising questions about its degree of resistance to neutralising antibodies. Using a spike-pseudotyped virus model we characterise neutralisation of BA.2.86 by clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies and by two cohorts of serum sampled from Stockholm, including both a recent cohort, and one sampled prior to the arrival of XBB in Sweden.\nConcurrent administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines enhances Spike-specific antibody responses\nAuthors: Barouch, S. E.; Chicz, T. M.; Blanc, R.; Barbati, D. R.; Parker, L. J.; Tong, X.; McNamara, R. P.\nScore: 218.4, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557347\nThe bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.\nXBB.1.5 Spike Protein COVID-19 Vaccine Induces Broadly Neutralizing and Cellular Immune Responses Against EG.5.1 and Emerging XBB Variants\nAuthors: Patel, N.; Trost, J. F.; Guebre-Xabier, M.; Zhou, H.; Norton, J.; Jiang, D.; Cai, Z.; Zhu, M.; Marchese, A. M.; Greene, A. M.; Mallory, R. M.; Kalkeri, R.; Dubovsky, F.; Smith, G.\nScore: 491.7, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.554497\nMonovalent SARS-CoV-2 Prototype (Wuhan-Hu-1) and bivalent (Prototype + BA.4/5) COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated a waning of vaccine-mediated immunity highlighted by lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB sub-variants. The reduction of humoral immunity due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has signaled the need for an update to vaccine composition. A strain change for all authorized/approved vaccines to a monovalent composition with Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 has been supported by the WHO, EMA, and FDA. Here, we demonstrate that immunization with a monovalent recombinant spike protein COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax, Inc.) based on the subvariant XBB.1.5 induces cross-neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1, and XBB.1.16.6 subvariants, promotes higher pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers than bivalent (Prototype + XBB.1.5) vaccine, induces SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Th1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses against XBB subvariants, and robustly boosts antibody responses in mice and nonhuman primates primed with a variety of monovalent and bivalent vaccines. Together, these data support updating the Novavax vaccine to a monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation for the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination campaign.\nMajority of human circulating plasmablasts stop blasting: A probable misnomer\nAuthors: Nguyen, D. C.; Saney, C.; Hentenaar, I. T.; Cabrera-Mora, M.; Woodruff, M. C.; Andrews, J.; Lonial, S.; Sanz, I.; Lee, F. E.-H.\nScore: 45.5, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.557057\nFollowing infection or vaccination, early-minted antibody secreting cells (ASC) or plasmablasts appear in circulation transiently, and a small fraction migrates to the spleen or bone marrow (BM) to mature into long-lived plasma cells (LLPC). While LLPC, by definition, are quiescent or non-dividing, the majority of blood ASC are thought to be \"blasting\" or proliferative. In this study, we find \u003e95% nascent blood ASC in culture express Ki-67 but only 6-12% incorporate BrdU after 4h or 24h labeling. In contrast, \u003c5% BM LLPC in culture are Ki-67+ with no BrdU uptake. Due to limitations of traditional flow cytometry, we utilized a novel optofluidic technology to evaluate cell division with simultaneous functional Ig secretion. We find 11% early-minted blood ASC undergo division, and none of the terminally differentiated BM LLPC (CD19-CD38hiCD138+) divide during the 7-21 days in culture. While BM LLPC undergo complete cell cycle arrest, the process of differentiation into an ASC of plasmablasts discourages entry into S phase. Since the majority of Ki-67+ nascent blood ASC have exited cell cycle and are no longer actively \"blasting\", the term \"plasmablast\", which traditionally refers to an ASC that still has the capacity to divide, may probably be a misnomer.\nProximal immune-epithelial progenitor interactions drive chronic tissue sequelae post COVID-19\nAuthors: Narasimhan, H.; Cheon, I. S.; Qian, W.; Hu, S.; Parimon, T.; Zang, C.; Chen, P.; Sun, J.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557622\nThe long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5+ basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.\nB Cells Promote T Cell Immunosenescence and Mammalian Aging Parameters\nAuthors: Khan, S.; Chakraborty, M.; Wu, F.; Chen, N.; Wang, T.; Chan, Y. T.; Sayad, A.; Vasquez, J.-D. S.; Kotlyar, M.; Nguyen, K.; Huang, Y.; Alibhai, F. J.; Woo, M.; Li, R.-K.; Husain, M.; Jurisica, I.; Gehring, A. J.; Ohashi, P. S.; Furman, D.; Tsai, S.; Winer, S.; Winer, D. A.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.556363\nA dysregulated adaptive immune system is a key feature of aging, and is associated with age-related chronic diseases and mortality. Most notably, aging is linked to a loss in the diversity of the T cell repertoire and expansion of activated inflammatory age-related T cell subsets, though the main drivers of these processes are largely unknown. Here, we find that T cell aging is directly influenced by B cells. Using multiple models of B cell manipulation and single-cell omics, we find B cells to be a major cell type that is largely responsible for the age-related reduction of naive T cells, their associated differentiation towards pathogenic immunosenescent T cell subsets, and for the clonal restriction of their T cell receptor (TCR). Accordingly, we find that these pathogenic shifts can be therapeutically targeted via CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment. Mechanistically, we uncover a new role for insulin receptor signaling in influencing age-related B cell pathogenicity that in turn induces T cell dysfunction and a decline in healthspan parameters. These results establish B cells as a pivotal force contributing to age-associated adaptive immune dysfunction and healthspan outcomes, and suggest new modalities to manage aging and related multi-morbidity.\nTAPIR: a T-cell receptor language model for predicting rare and novel targets\nAuthors: Fast, E.; Dhar, M.; Chen, B.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557285\nT-cell receptors (TCRs) are involved in most human diseases, but linking their sequences with their targets remains an unsolved grand challenge in the field. In this study, we present TAPIR (T-cell receptor and Peptide Interaction Recognizer), a T-cell receptor (TCR) language model that predicts TCR-target interactions, with a focus on novel and rare targets. TAPIR employs deep convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to process TCR and target sequences across flexible representations (e.g., beta-chain only, unknown MHC allele, etc.) and learns patterns of interactivity via several training tasks. This flexibility allows TAPIR to train on more than 50k either paired (alpha and beta chain) or unpaired TCRs (just alpha or beta chain) from public and proprietary databases against 1933 unique targets. TAPIR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when predicting TCR interactivity against common benchmark targets and is the first method to demonstrate strong performance when predicting TCR interactivity against novel targets, where no examples are provided in training. TAPIR is also capable of predicting TCR interaction against MHC alleles in the absence of target information. Leveraging these capabilities, we apply TAPIR to cancer patient TCR repertoires and identify and validate a novel and potent anti-cancer T-cell receptor against a shared cancer neoantigen target (PIK3CA H1047L). We further show how TAPIR, when extended with a generative neural network, is capable of directly designing T-cell receptor sequences that interact with a target of interest.\nAllergen-induced airway matrix remodelling in mice can be prevented or reversed by targeting chitinase-like proteins.\nAuthors: Parkinson, J. E.; Adamson, A. D.; MacDonald, A. S.; Allen, J. E.; Sutherland, T. E.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553857\nChitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are biomarkers of inflammation and airway remodelling in asthma, yet their direct contribution towards disease pathogenesis is unknown. Using a mouse model of allergen-induced type 2/type 17 airway inflammation we sought to directly investigate the role of the murine CLPs Ym1 and Ym2 during chronic lung pathology. Data demonstrated distinct chronic inflammatory roles for Ym2, IL-13, and IL-17a signalling pathways. Notably, only CLPs were key for initiating the pathogenic accumulation and re-organisation of the pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Furthermore, inhibition of CLPs after chronic pathology developed, reversed airway remodelling independently of chronic inflammation. These studies disentangle chronic IL-13 and IL-17a signalling from the development of allergic airway remodelling and instead highlight a central role for CLPs, which provides new avenues to therapeutically target aberrant ECM accumulation.\nAn explainable language model for antibody specificity prediction using curated influenza hemagglutinin antibodies\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Lv, H.; Lei, R.; Yeung, Y.-H.; Shen, I. R.; Choi, D.; Teo, Q. W.; Tan, T. J. C.; Gopal, A. B.; Chen, X.; Graham, C. S.; Wu, N. C.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557288\nDespite decades of antibody research, it remains challenging to predict the specificity of an antibody solely based on its sequence. Two major obstacles are the lack of appropriate models and inaccessibility of datasets for model training. In this study, we curated a dataset of \u003e5,000 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies by mining research publications and patents, which revealed many distinct sequence features between antibodies to HA head and stem domains. We then leveraged this dataset to develop a lightweight memory B cell language model (mBLM) for sequence-based antibody specificity prediction. Model explainability analysis showed that mBLM captured key sequence motifs of HA stem antibodies. Additionally, by applying mBLM to HA antibodies with unknown epitopes, we discovered and experimentally validated many HA stem antibodies. Overall, this study not only advances our molecular understanding of antibody response to influenza virus, but also provides an invaluable resource for applying deep learning to antibody research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant, BA.2.86, which carries a substantial number of Spike mutations, has raised a global alarm. An immediate assessment of its antigenic properties and infectivity is necessary. Here, we reveal the distinct antigenicity of BA.2.86 compared with previous variants including XBB.1.5. BA.2.86 significantly evades convalescent plasma from XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfections. Key mutations that mediate the enhanced resistance include N450D, K356T, L452W, A484K, V483del, and V445H on the RBD, while BA.2.86s NTD mutations and E554K on SD1 also largely contribute. However, we found that BA.2.86 pseudovirus exhibits compromised efficiency of infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells compared to XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which may be caused by K356T, V483del, and E554K, and could potentially limit BA.2.86s transmissibility. In sum, it appears that BA.2.86 has traded its infectivity for higher immune evasion during long-term host-viral evolution. Close attention should be paid to monitoring additional mutations that could improve BA.2.86s infectivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A new SARS-CoV-2 variant, designated BA.2.86, has recently emerged with over 30 spike mutations relative to its parental BA.2, raising questions about its degree of resistance to neutralising antibodies. Using a spike-pseudotyped virus model we characterise neutralisation of BA.2.86 by clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies and by two cohorts of serum sampled from Stockholm, including both a recent cohort, and one sampled prior to the arrival of XBB in Sweden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monovalent SARS-CoV-2 Prototype (Wuhan-Hu-1) and bivalent (Prototype &#43; BA.4/5) COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated a waning of vaccine-mediated immunity highlighted by lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB sub-variants. The reduction of humoral immunity due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has signaled the need for an update to vaccine composition. A strain change for all authorized/approved vaccines to a monovalent composition with Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 has been supported by the WHO, EMA, and FDA. Here, we demonstrate that immunization with a monovalent recombinant spike protein COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax, Inc.) based on the subvariant XBB.1.5 induces cross-neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1, and XBB.1.16.6 subvariants, promotes higher pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers than bivalent (Prototype &#43; XBB.1.5) vaccine, induces SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Th1-biased CD4&#43; T-cell responses against XBB subvariants, and robustly boosts antibody responses in mice and nonhuman primates primed with a variety of monovalent and bivalent vaccines. Together, these data support updating the Novavax vaccine to a monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation for the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination campaign.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Following infection or vaccination, early-minted antibody secreting cells (ASC) or plasmablasts appear in circulation transiently, and a small fraction migrates to the spleen or bone marrow (BM) to mature into long-lived plasma cells (LLPC). While LLPC, by definition, are quiescent or non-dividing, the majority of blood ASC are thought to be &#34;blasting&#34; or proliferative. In this study, we find &gt;95% nascent blood ASC in culture express Ki-67 but only 6-12% incorporate BrdU after 4h or 24h labeling. In contrast, &lt;5% BM LLPC in culture are Ki-67&#43; with no BrdU uptake. Due to limitations of traditional flow cytometry, we utilized a novel optofluidic technology to evaluate cell division with simultaneous functional Ig secretion. We find 11% early-minted blood ASC undergo division, and none of the terminally differentiated BM LLPC (CD19-CD38hiCD138&#43;) divide during the 7-21 days in culture. While BM LLPC undergo complete cell cycle arrest, the process of differentiation into an ASC of plasmablasts discourages entry into S phase. Since the majority of Ki-67&#43; nascent blood ASC have exited cell cycle and are no longer actively &#34;blasting&#34;, the term &#34;plasmablast&#34;, which traditionally refers to an ASC that still has the capacity to divide, may probably be a misnomer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8&#43; T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5&#43; basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8&#43; T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A dysregulated adaptive immune system is a key feature of aging, and is associated with age-related chronic diseases and mortality. Most notably, aging is linked to a loss in the diversity of the T cell repertoire and expansion of activated inflammatory age-related T cell subsets, though the main drivers of these processes are largely unknown. Here, we find that T cell aging is directly influenced by B cells. Using multiple models of B cell manipulation and single-cell omics, we find B cells to be a major cell type that is largely responsible for the age-related reduction of naive T cells, their associated differentiation towards pathogenic immunosenescent T cell subsets, and for the clonal restriction of their T cell receptor (TCR). Accordingly, we find that these pathogenic shifts can be therapeutically targeted via CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment. Mechanistically, we uncover a new role for insulin receptor signaling in influencing age-related B cell pathogenicity that in turn induces T cell dysfunction and a decline in healthspan parameters. These results establish B cells as a pivotal force contributing to age-associated adaptive immune dysfunction and healthspan outcomes, and suggest new modalities to manage aging and related multi-morbidity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T-cell receptors (TCRs) are involved in most human diseases, but linking their sequences with their targets remains an unsolved grand challenge in the field. In this study, we present TAPIR (T-cell receptor and Peptide Interaction Recognizer), a T-cell receptor (TCR) language model that predicts TCR-target interactions, with a focus on novel and rare targets. TAPIR employs deep convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to process TCR and target sequences across flexible representations (e.g., beta-chain only, unknown MHC allele, etc.) and learns patterns of interactivity via several training tasks. This flexibility allows TAPIR to train on more than 50k either paired (alpha and beta chain) or unpaired TCRs (just alpha or beta chain) from public and proprietary databases against 1933 unique targets. TAPIR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when predicting TCR interactivity against common benchmark targets and is the first method to demonstrate strong performance when predicting TCR interactivity against novel targets, where no examples are provided in training. TAPIR is also capable of predicting TCR interaction against MHC alleles in the absence of target information. Leveraging these capabilities, we apply TAPIR to cancer patient TCR repertoires and identify and validate a novel and potent anti-cancer T-cell receptor against a shared cancer neoantigen target (PIK3CA H1047L). We further show how TAPIR, when extended with a generative neural network, is capable of directly designing T-cell receptor sequences that interact with a target of interest.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are biomarkers of inflammation and airway remodelling in asthma, yet their direct contribution towards disease pathogenesis is unknown. Using a mouse model of allergen-induced type 2/type 17 airway inflammation we sought to directly investigate the role of the murine CLPs Ym1 and Ym2 during chronic lung pathology. Data demonstrated distinct chronic inflammatory roles for Ym2, IL-13, and IL-17a signalling pathways. Notably, only CLPs were key for initiating the pathogenic accumulation and re-organisation of the pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Furthermore, inhibition of CLPs after chronic pathology developed, reversed airway remodelling independently of chronic inflammation. These studies disentangle chronic IL-13 and IL-17a signalling from the development of allergic airway remodelling and instead highlight a central role for CLPs, which provides new avenues to therapeutically target aberrant ECM accumulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite decades of antibody research, it remains challenging to predict the specificity of an antibody solely based on its sequence. Two major obstacles are the lack of appropriate models and inaccessibility of datasets for model training. In this study, we curated a dataset of &gt;5,000 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies by mining research publications and patents, which revealed many distinct sequence features between antibodies to HA head and stem domains. We then leveraged this dataset to develop a lightweight memory B cell language model (mBLM) for sequence-based antibody specificity prediction. Model explainability analysis showed that mBLM captured key sequence motifs of HA stem antibodies. Additionally, by applying mBLM to HA antibodies with unknown epitopes, we discovered and experimentally validated many HA stem antibodies. Overall, this study not only advances our molecular understanding of antibody response to influenza virus, but also provides an invaluable resource for applying deep learning to antibody research.</p>
