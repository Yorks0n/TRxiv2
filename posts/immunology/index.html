Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.\nThe T cell receptor sequence influences the likelihood of T cell memory formation\nAuthors: Lagattuta, K. A.; Nathan, A.; Rumker, L.; Birnbaum, M. E.; Raychaudhuri, S.\nScore: 35.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549939\nT cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.\nProlonged exposure to lung-derived cytokines is associated with inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19\nAuthors: Grant, R. A.; Poor, T. A.; Sichizya, L.; Diaz, E.; Bailey, J. I.; Soni, S.; Senkow, K. J.; Perez-Leonor, X. G.; Abdala-Valencia, H.; Lu, Z.; Donnelly, H. K.; Tighe, R. M.; Lomasney, J. W.; Wunderink, R. G.; Singer, B. D.; Misharin, A. V.; Budinger, G. R. S.; The NU SCRIPT Investigators, Score: 25.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550765\nNeurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-[a] and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2--molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.\nThe transcriptional response in mosquitoes distinguishes between fungi and bacteria but not Gram types\nAuthors: Hixson, B.; Huot, L.; Morejon, B.; Yang, X.; Nagy, P.; Michel, K.; Buchon, N.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550663\nMosquitoes are prolific vectors of human pathogens; a clear and accurate understanding of the organization of their antimicrobial defenses is crucial for informing the development of transmission control strategies. The canonical infection response in insects, as described in the insect model Drosophila melanogaster, is pathogen type-dependent, with distinct stereotypical responses to Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria/fungi mediated by the activation of the Imd and Toll pathways, respectively. To determine whether this pathogen-specific discrimination is shared by mosquitoes, we used RNAseq to capture the genome-wide transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) to systemic infection with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, as well as challenge with heat-killed Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal pathogens. From the resulting data, we found that Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae both mount a core response to all categories of infection, and this response is highly conserved between the two species with respect to both function and orthology. When we compared the transcriptomes of mosquitoes infected with different types of bacteria, we observed that the intensity of the transcriptional response was correlated with both the virulence and growth rate of the infecting pathogen. Exhaustive comparisons of the transcriptomes of Gram-negative-challenged versus Gram-positive-challenged mosquitoes yielded no difference in either species. In Ae. aegypti, however, we identified transcriptional signatures specific to bacterial infection and to fungal infection. The bacterial infection response was dominated by the expression of defensins and cecropins, while the fungal infection response included the disproportionate upregulation of an uncharacterized family of glycine-rich proteins. These signatures were also observed in Ae. aegypti challenged with heat-killed bacteria and fungi, indicating that this species can discriminate between molecular patterns that are specific to bacteria and to fungi.\nMurine classical monocyte subsets display distinct functions and fates\nAuthors: Trzebanski, S.; Kim, J.-S.; Larrossi, N.; Kancheva, D.; Bastos, J.; Haddad, M.; Aizik, D.; Kralova, J.; Gross-Vered, M.; Boura-Halfon, S.; Lapidot, T.; Alon, R.; Movahedi, K.; Jung, S.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551083\nMonocytes are short-lived myeloid immune cells that arise from adult haematopoiesis and circulate in the blood after maturation. Monocytes comprise two main subsets, that are in mice defined as classical Ly6Chigh and non-classical Ly6Clow cells (CM, NCM). Recent transcriptomic analyses suggest that CM themselves are heterogeneous. Here, we report surface markers that allow segregation of murine neutrophil-like and DC-like CM (NeuMo, DCMo) in the BM and blood. Functional characterization, including fate definition following adoptive cell transfer, established that NeuMo and DCMo can give equal rise to homeostatic CM progeny, such as NCM and gut macrophages. Fates differed, however, in selected other tissues, such as the lungs and brain meninges. Collectively, we provide comprehensive evidence for the existence of two functionally distinct CM subsets in the mouse, which differentially contribute to peripheral tissue macrophage populations, indicative of impact of monocyte ontogeny on in situ differentiation.\nA humoral stress response protects Drosophila tissues from antimicrobial peptides\nAuthors: Rommelaere, S.; Carboni, A.; Bada Juarez, J. F.; Boquete, J.-P.; Abriata, L. A.; Teixeira Pinto Meireles, F.; Rukes, V.; Vincent, C. M.; Kondo, S.; Dionne, M. S.; Dal Peraro, M.; Cao, C.; Lemaitre, B.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550293\nThe immune response against an invading pathogen is generally associated with collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. Consequently, several resilience mechanisms have evolved to attenuate the negative impacts of immune effectors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that contribute to innate defenses by targeting negatively charged membranes of microbes1, 2. While being protective against pathogens, AMPs can be cytotoxic to host cells1, 3. Little is known of mechanisms that protect host tissues from AMP-induced immunopathology. Here, we reveal that a family of stress-induced proteins, the Turandots4, 5, protect Drosophila host tissues from AMPs, increasing resilience to stress. Deletion of several Turandot genes increases fly susceptibility to environmental stresses due to trachea apoptosis and poor oxygen supply. Tracheal cell membranes expose high levels of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid, sensitizing them to the action of AMPs. Turandots are secreted from the fat body upon stress and bind to tracheal cells to protect them against AMPs. In vitro, Turandot A binds to phosphatidylserine on membranes and inhibits the pore-forming activity of Drosophila and human AMPs on eukaryotic cells without affecting their microbicidal activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Turandot stress proteins mitigate AMP cytotoxicity to host tissues and therefore improve their efficacy. This provides a first example of a humoral mechanism used by animals limiting host-encoded AMP collateral damages.\nHigh dimensional analyses reveal activation of lymphocyte subsets and reversal of immunoresistance by cytokine enhancement of adoptive cellular vaccine therapy in prostate cancer.\nAuthors: Saeed, M.; Peng, B.; Kim, K.; Borkowski, A.; Van Tine, B.; Sheikh, N.; Vu, T.; Thorek, D.; Fehniger, T.; Pachynski, R.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550213\nEngineered cell therapies have emerged as a potent therapeutic option for the hematologic malignancies, however solid tumor responses to similar approaches have been modest. The outlier is Sipuleucel-T (sip-T), an FDA-approved autologous cellular immunotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To elucidate parameters of the response profile to this therapy, we report the first high dimensional cellular analyses of sip-T using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and show a lymphoid predominance, with CD3+ T cells constituting the highest proportion (median [~]60%) of sip-T, followed by B-cells, and natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. We hypothesized that treatment of sip-T with homeostatic cytokines known to activate/expand effector lymphocytes could augment efficacy against prostate cancer. Of cytokines tested, IL-15 treated sip-T showed the most significant activation and proliferation of effector lymphocytes, as well as augmentation of tumor cytotoxicity in vitro. Co-culture of sip-T with IL-15 and control or prostate-relevant antigens showed significant activation and expansion of CD8 T and NKT cells in an antigen-specific manner. Adoptive transfer of IL-15 treated sip-T into NSG mice resulted in potent prostate tumor growth inhibition compared with control sip-T. Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a 2 to 14-fold higher influx of sip-T and a significant increase in interferon (IFN)-{gamma} producing CD8+ T and NKT cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the IL-15 group. In conclusion, we put forward the first evidence that IL-15 treatment can enhance the functional anti-tumor efficacy of sip-T, providing rationale for combining IL-15 or IL-15 agonists with sip-T to treat mCRPC patients.

K.; Ramteke, N.; Zaib, A.; Nandi, D.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550474\nInterferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), the sole member of the type-II interferon family, is well known to protect the host from infectious diseases as well as mount anti-tumour responses. The amounts of IFN-{gamma} in the tumour microenvironment determine the host responses against tumours; however, several tumours employ evasive strategies by responding to low IFN-{gamma} signalling. In this study, the response of various tumour cell lines to IFN-{gamma} was studied in vitro. IFN-{gamma}-activation increases glycolytic flux and reduces mitochondrial function in a nitric oxide (NO)- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in the H6 hepatoma tumour cell line. The higher glycolysis further fuelled NO and ROS production, indicating a reciprocal regulation. These processes are accompanied by Hypoxia inducing factor (HIF)-1 stabilization and HIF-1-dependent augmentation of the glycolytic flux. The IFN-{gamma} enhancement of lactate production also occurred in other NO-producing cell lines: RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage and Renca renal adenocarcinoma. However, two other tumour cell lines, CT26 colon carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma, did not produce NO and lactate upon IFN-{gamma}-activation. HIF-1 stabilization upon IFN-{gamma}-activation led to lower cell growth of B16F10 but not CT26 cells. Importantly, the IFN-{gamma}-activation of both CT26 and B16F10 cells demonstrated significant cellular growth reduction upon metabolic rewiring by exogenous administration of potassium lactate. Clinical studies have shown the crucial roles of IFN-{gamma} for successful cancer immunotherapies involving checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The positive implications of this study on the metabolic modulation of IFN-{gamma} activation on heterogeneous tumour cells are discussed.\nTGF-β broadly modifies rather than specifically suppresses reactivated memory CD8 T cells in a dose-dependent manner\nAuthors: Taber, A.; Konecny, A.; Scott-Browne, J.; Prlic, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550871\nTransforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) directly acts on naive, effector and memory T cells to control cell fate decisions, which was shown using genetic abrogation of TGF-{beta} signaling. TGF-{beta} availability is altered by infections and cancer, however the dose-dependent effects of TGF-{beta} on memory CD8 T cell (Tmem) reactivation are still poorly defined. We examined how activation and TGF-{beta} signals interact to shape the functional outcome of Tmem reactivation. We found that TGF-{beta} could suppress cytotoxicity in a manner that was inversely proportional to the strength of the activating TCR or pro-inflammatory signals. In contrast, even high doses of TGF-{beta} had a comparatively modest effect on IFN-{gamma} expression in the context of weak and strong reactivation signals. Since CD8 Tmem may not always receive TGF-{beta} signals concurrently with reactivation, we also explored whether the temporal order of reactivation versus TGF-{beta} signals is of importance. We found that exposure to TGF-{beta} prior to as well as after an activation event were both sufficient to reduce cytotoxic effector function. Concurrent ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed that TGF-{beta} altered [~]10% of the regulatory elements induced by reactivation and also elicited transcriptional changes indicative of broadly modulated functional properties. We confirmed some changes on the protein level and found that TGF-{beta}-induced expression of CCR8 was inversely proportional to the strength of the reactivating TCR signal. Together, our data suggest that TGF-{beta} is not simply suppressing CD8 Tmem, but modifies functional and chemotactic properties in context of their reactivation signals and in a dose-dependent manner.\nMERTK Coordinates Efferocytosis by Regulating Integrin Localization and Activation\nAuthors: Dickson, B. H.; Tasnim, T.; Lam, A. L.; Vreize, A.; Blythe, E. N.; Dekaban, G. A.; Heit, B.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549870\nEfferocytosis - the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells - is a central component of tissue homeostasis, and in many tissues is mediated by the efferocytic receptor MERTK expressed by macrophages. Although MERTK is critical for efferocytosis, the mechanism by which it directs the engulfment of apoptotic cells is largely unknown. Using immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and super-resolution microscopy, we have identified a pre-formed receptor complex on the macrophage plasma membrane comprised of [~]180 nm clusters of MERTK, {beta}2 integrins, and multiple signaling molecules including Src-family kinases, PI3-kinases, and the integrin regulatory proteins ILK and FAK. MERTK is unable to mediate efferocytosis in the absence of {beta}2 integrins or their opsonins, while {beta}2 integrins require activation via MERTK signaling to induce the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Using FRET microscopy, we determined that MERTK directly induces the conformational change of {beta}2 integrins from the low to high-affinity form via a PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. MERTK and {beta}2 integrins then form a highly structured synapse in which MERTK is retained by ligand-induced clustering in the synapse centre, while {beta}2 integrins and actin form a Src family kinase-, ILK- and FAK-dependent expanding ring which defines the leading edge of the synapse that ultimately engulfs the apoptotic cell. The identification of the MERTK membrane-proximal signaling pathway and the role of {beta}2 integrins in this pathway provides new insights into the function of this critical homeostatic receptor and provides new insights into how MERTK mutations and signaling defects may contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">More than 90% of total human plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) is found in a fucosylated form, but specific IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) are found in response to infections with enveloped viruses and to alloantigens on blood cells. Afucosylated IgGs mediate immunopathology in severe COVID-19 and dengue fever in humans. In COVID-19, the early formation of non-neutralizing afucosylated IgG against the spike protein predicts and directly mediates disease progression to severe form. IgG lacking core fucosylation causes dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by intense Fc{gamma}R-mediated stimulation of macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets. The mechanism and the context within which afucosylated IgG formation occurs in response to enveloped virus antigens have remained elusive thus far in COVID-19, dengue fever, and other infections. This study demonstrates that administration of human bone marrow megakaryocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice drives the formation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgG antibodies, and is sufficient to reproduce severe COVID-19 manifestations of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and death in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cell differentiation depends on activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), whose amino acid sequence varies cell to cell. Particular TCR amino acid sequences nearly guarantee Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cell fates. To comprehensively define how TCR amino acids affects all T cell fates, we analyze the paired {beta}TCR sequence and transcriptome of 819,772 single cells. We find that hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote regulatory T cell transcriptional states in both the CD8 and CD4 lineages. Most strikingly, we find a set of TCR sequence features, concentrated in CDR2, that promotes positive selection in the thymus as well as transition from naive to memory in the periphery. Even among T cells that recognize the same antigen, these TCR sequence features help to explain which T cells form immunological memory, which is essential for effective pathogen response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-[a] and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2--molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes are prolific vectors of human pathogens; a clear and accurate understanding of the organization of their antimicrobial defenses is crucial for informing the development of transmission control strategies. The canonical infection response in insects, as described in the insect model Drosophila melanogaster, is pathogen type-dependent, with distinct stereotypical responses to Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria/fungi mediated by the activation of the Imd and Toll pathways, respectively. To determine whether this pathogen-specific discrimination is shared by mosquitoes, we used RNAseq to capture the genome-wide transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) to systemic infection with Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, as well as challenge with heat-killed Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal pathogens. From the resulting data, we found that Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae both mount a core response to all categories of infection, and this response is highly conserved between the two species with respect to both function and orthology. When we compared the transcriptomes of mosquitoes infected with different types of bacteria, we observed that the intensity of the transcriptional response was correlated with both the virulence and growth rate of the infecting pathogen. Exhaustive comparisons of the transcriptomes of Gram-negative-challenged versus Gram-positive-challenged mosquitoes yielded no difference in either species. In Ae. aegypti, however, we identified transcriptional signatures specific to bacterial infection and to fungal infection. The bacterial infection response was dominated by the expression of defensins and cecropins, while the fungal infection response included the disproportionate upregulation of an uncharacterized family of glycine-rich proteins. These signatures were also observed in Ae. aegypti challenged with heat-killed bacteria and fungi, indicating that this species can discriminate between molecular patterns that are specific to bacteria and to fungi.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monocytes are short-lived myeloid immune cells that arise from adult haematopoiesis and circulate in the blood after maturation. Monocytes comprise two main subsets, that are in mice defined as classical Ly6Chigh and non-classical Ly6Clow cells (CM, NCM). Recent transcriptomic analyses suggest that CM themselves are heterogeneous. Here, we report surface markers that allow segregation of murine neutrophil-like and DC-like CM (NeuMo, DCMo) in the BM and blood. Functional characterization, including fate definition following adoptive cell transfer, established that NeuMo and DCMo can give equal rise to homeostatic CM progeny, such as NCM and gut macrophages. Fates differed, however, in selected other tissues, such as the lungs and brain meninges. Collectively, we provide comprehensive evidence for the existence of two functionally distinct CM subsets in the mouse, which differentially contribute to peripheral tissue macrophage populations, indicative of impact of monocyte ontogeny on in situ differentiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The immune response against an invading pathogen is generally associated with collateral tissue damage caused by the immune system itself. Consequently, several resilience mechanisms have evolved to attenuate the negative impacts of immune effectors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides that contribute to innate defenses by targeting negatively charged membranes of microbes1, 2. While being protective against pathogens, AMPs can be cytotoxic to host cells1, 3. Little is known of mechanisms that protect host tissues from AMP-induced immunopathology. Here, we reveal that a family of stress-induced proteins, the Turandots4, 5, protect Drosophila host tissues from AMPs, increasing resilience to stress. Deletion of several Turandot genes increases fly susceptibility to environmental stresses due to trachea apoptosis and poor oxygen supply. Tracheal cell membranes expose high levels of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid, sensitizing them to the action of AMPs. Turandots are secreted from the fat body upon stress and bind to tracheal cells to protect them against AMPs. In vitro, Turandot A binds to phosphatidylserine on membranes and inhibits the pore-forming activity of Drosophila and human AMPs on eukaryotic cells without affecting their microbicidal activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Turandot stress proteins mitigate AMP cytotoxicity to host tissues and therefore improve their efficacy. This provides a first example of a humoral mechanism used by animals limiting host-encoded AMP collateral damages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Engineered cell therapies have emerged as a potent therapeutic option for the hematologic malignancies, however solid tumor responses to similar approaches have been modest. The outlier is Sipuleucel-T (sip-T), an FDA-approved autologous cellular immunotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To elucidate parameters of the response profile to this therapy, we report the first high dimensional cellular analyses of sip-T using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and show a lymphoid predominance, with CD3&#43; T cells constituting the highest proportion (median [~]60%) of sip-T, followed by B-cells, and natural killer (NK) and NKT cells.

We hypothesized that treatment of sip-T with homeostatic cytokines known to activate/expand effector lymphocytes could augment efficacy against prostate cancer. Of cytokines tested, IL-15 treated sip-T showed the most significant activation and proliferation of effector lymphocytes, as well as augmentation of tumor cytotoxicity in vitro. Co-culture of sip-T with IL-15 and control or prostate-relevant antigens showed significant activation and expansion of CD8 T and NKT cells in an antigen-specific manner. Adoptive transfer of IL-15 treated sip-T into NSG mice resulted in potent prostate tumor growth inhibition compared with control sip-T. Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a 2 to 14-fold higher influx of sip-T and a significant increase in interferon (IFN)-{gamma} producing CD8&#43; T and NKT cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the IL-15 group. In conclusion, we put forward the first evidence that IL-15 treatment can enhance the functional anti-tumor efficacy of sip-T, providing rationale for combining IL-15 or IL-15 agonists with sip-T to treat mCRPC patients.

        <p class="abstract">Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), the sole member of the type-II interferon family, is well known to protect the host from infectious diseases as well as mount anti-tumour responses. The amounts of IFN-{gamma} in the tumour microenvironment determine the host responses against tumours; however, several tumours employ evasive strategies by responding to low IFN-{gamma} signalling. In this study, the response of various tumour cell lines to IFN-{gamma} was studied in vitro. IFN-{gamma}-activation increases glycolytic flux and reduces mitochondrial function in a nitric oxide (NO)- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in the H6 hepatoma tumour cell line. The higher glycolysis further fuelled NO and ROS production, indicating a reciprocal regulation. These processes are accompanied by Hypoxia inducing factor (HIF)-1 stabilization and HIF-1-dependent augmentation of the glycolytic flux. The IFN-{gamma} enhancement of lactate production also occurred in other NO-producing cell lines: RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage and Renca renal adenocarcinoma. However, two other tumour cell lines, CT26 colon carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma, did not produce NO and lactate upon IFN-{gamma}-activation. HIF-1 stabilization upon IFN-{gamma}-activation led to lower cell growth of B16F10 but not CT26 cells. Importantly, the IFN-{gamma}-activation of both CT26 and B16F10 cells demonstrated significant cellular growth reduction upon metabolic rewiring by exogenous administration of potassium lactate. Clinical studies have shown the crucial roles of IFN-{gamma} for successful cancer immunotherapies involving checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The positive implications of this study on the metabolic modulation of IFN-{gamma} activation on heterogeneous tumour cells are discussed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) directly acts on naive, effector and memory T cells to control cell fate decisions, which was shown using genetic abrogation of TGF-{beta} signaling. TGF-{beta} availability is altered by infections and cancer, however the dose-dependent effects of TGF-{beta} on memory CD8 T cell (Tmem) reactivation are still poorly defined. We examined how activation and TGF-{beta} signals interact to shape the functional outcome of Tmem reactivation. We found that TGF-{beta} could suppress cytotoxicity in a manner that was inversely proportional to the strength of the activating TCR or pro-inflammatory signals. In contrast, even high doses of TGF-{beta} had a comparatively modest effect on IFN-{gamma} expression in the context of weak and strong reactivation signals. Since CD8 Tmem may not always receive TGF-{beta} signals concurrently with reactivation, we also explored whether the temporal order of reactivation versus TGF-{beta} signals is of importance. We found that exposure to TGF-{beta} prior to as well as after an activation event were both sufficient to reduce cytotoxic effector function. Concurrent ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed that TGF-{beta} altered [~]10% of the regulatory elements induced by reactivation and also elicited transcriptional changes indicative of broadly modulated functional properties. We confirmed some changes on the protein level and found that TGF-{beta}-induced expression of CCR8 was inversely proportional to the strength of the reactivating TCR signal. Together, our data suggest that TGF-{beta} is not simply suppressing CD8 Tmem, but modifies functional and chemotactic properties in context of their reactivation signals and in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Efferocytosis - the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells - is a central component of tissue homeostasis, and in many tissues is mediated by the efferocytic receptor MERTK expressed by macrophages. Although MERTK is critical for efferocytosis, the mechanism by which it directs the engulfment of apoptotic cells is largely unknown. Using immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and super-resolution microscopy, we have identified a pre-formed receptor complex on the macrophage plasma membrane comprised of [~]180 nm clusters of MERTK, {beta}2 integrins, and multiple signaling molecules including Src-family kinases, PI3-kinases, and the integrin regulatory proteins ILK and FAK. MERTK is unable to mediate efferocytosis in the absence of {beta}2 integrins or their opsonins, while {beta}2 integrins require activation via MERTK signaling to induce the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Using FRET microscopy, we determined that MERTK directly induces the conformational change of {beta}2 integrins from the low to high-affinity form via a PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. MERTK and {beta}2 integrins then form a highly structured synapse in which MERTK is retained by ligand-induced clustering in the synapse centre, while {beta}2 integrins and actin form a Src family kinase-, ILK- and FAK-dependent expanding ring which defines the leading edge of the synapse that ultimately engulfs the apoptotic cell. The identification of the MERTK membrane-proximal signaling pathway and the role of {beta}2 integrins in this pathway provides new insights into the function of this critical homeostatic receptor and provides new insights into how MERTK mutations and signaling defects may contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</p>
