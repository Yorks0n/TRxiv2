CAR T cell therapy has enjoyed success in the clinic for hematological cancer indications, giving rise to decade-long remissions in some cases. However, CAR T therapy for patients with solid tumors has not seen similar successes. Solid tumors constitute 90% of adult human cancers, representing an enormous unmet clinical need. Current approaches do not solve the central problem of limited ability of therapeutic cells to migrate through the stromal matrix. We discover that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype is mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced inflammatory cytokines that include IL5, TNF, IFN{gamma}, and IL8. We exploit this finding to \"lock-in\" a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing receptors, which we call velocity receptors (VRs). VRs target these cytokines and signal through these cytokines cognate receptors to increase T cell motility and infiltrate lung, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors in large numbers and at doses for which control CAR T cells remain confined to the tumor periphery. In contrast to CAR therapy alone, VR-CAR T cells significantly attenuate tumor growth and extend overall survival. This work suggests that approaches to the design of immune cell receptors that focus on migration signaling will help current and future CAR cellular therapies to infiltrate deep into solid tumors.\nLocal delivery of cell surface-targeted immunocytokines programs systemic anti-tumor immunity\nAuthors: Santollani, L.; Zhang, Y. J.; Maiorino, L.; Palmeri, J. R.; Stinson, J. A.; Duhamel, L. R.; Qureshi, K.; Suggs, J. R.; Porth, O. T.; Pinney, W.; Al Msari, R.; Wittrup, K. D.; Irvine, D. J.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573641\nCytokine therapies are potent immunotherapy agents but exhibit severe dose-limiting toxicities. One strategy to overcome this involves engineering cytokines for intratumoral retention following local delivery. Here, we develop a localized cytokine therapy that elicits profound anti-tumor immunity by engineered targeting to the ubiquitous leukocyte receptor CD45. We designed CD45-targeted immunocytokines (CD45-Cyt) that, upon injection, decorated the surface of leukocytes in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) without systemic exposure. CD45-Cyt therapy eradicated both directly treated tumors and untreated distal lesions in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. Mechanistically, CD45-Cyt triggered prolonged pSTAT signaling and reprogrammed tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the TDLN to exhibit an anti-viral transcriptional signature. CD45 anchoring represents a broad platform for protein retention by host immune cells for use in immunotherapy.\nPrototype mRNA vaccines imprint broadly neutralizing human serum antibodies after Omicron variant-matched boosting\nAuthors: Liang, C.-Y.; Raju, S.; Liu, Z.; Li, Y.; Arunkumar, G. A.; Case, J. B.; Zost, S. J.; Acreman, C. M.; Carvalho dos Anjos, D. C.; McLellan, J. S.; Crowe, J. E.; Whelan, S. P. J.; Elbashir, S. M.; Edwards, D. K.; Diamond, M. S.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574018\nImmune imprinting is a phenomenon in which an individuals prior antigenic experiences influence responses to subsequent infection or vaccination. Here, using antibody depletion and multiplexed spike-binding assays, we characterized the type-specificity and cross-reactivity of serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccination in mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single priming dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling a robust generation of type-specific antibodies. However, substantial imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron mRNA vaccine. In humans who received two BA.5 or XBB.1.5 Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with circulating Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because the serum neutralizing response against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses was completely abrogated after pre-clearing with the Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes shaped and shared by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Our depletion analysis also identified cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 proteins with differential inhibitory effects on members of the sarbecovirus subgenus. Thus, although the serum antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is dominantly imprinted by prior immunizations with prototype mRNA-1273 vaccines, this outcome can be beneficial as it drives expansion of multiple classes of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and extend activity to distantly related sarbecoviruses.\nGM-CSF-mediated epithelial-immune cell crosstalk orchestrates pulmonary immunity to Aspergillus fumigatus\nAuthors: Mills, K.

M.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574062\nAspergillus fumigatus causes life-threatening mold pneumonia in immune compromised patients, particularly in those with quantitative or qualitative defects in neutrophils. While innate immune cell crosstalk licenses neutrophil antifungal activity in the lung, the role of epithelial cells in this process is unknown. Here, we find that that surfactant protein C (SPC)-expressing lung epithelial cells integrate infection-induced IL-1 and type III interferon signaling to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) preferentially at local sites of fungal infection and neutrophil influx. Using in vivo models that distinguish the role of GM-CSF during acute infection from its homeostatic function in alveolar macrophage survival and surfactant catabolism, we demonstrate that epithelial-derived GM-CSF increases the accumulation and fungicidal activity of GM-CSF-responsive neutrophils, with the latter being essential for host survival. Our findings establish SPC+ epithelial cells as a central player in regulating the quality and strength of neutrophil-dependent immunity against inhaled mold pathogens.

L.; Lee, R.-L.; Cocciolone, L.; Funk, K. E.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573675\nPrimarily a respiratory infection, numerous patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with neurologic symptoms, some continuing long after viral clearance as a persistent symptomatic phase termed \"long COVID\". Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease, as well as incidence of long COVID. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged immune response predispose elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection and post-infectious sequelae. Using a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), we found that aging increased clinical illness and lethality to MHV infection, with aged animals harboring increased virus in the brain during acute infection. This was coupled with an unexpected increase in activated CD8+ T cells within the brains of aged animals but reduced antigen specificity of those CD8+ T cells. Aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which correlated with increased neuronal cell death and reduced neuronal regeneration in aged hippocampus. Using primary cell culture, we demonstrated that activated CD8+ T cells induce neuronal death, independent of antigen-specificity. Specifically, higher levels of CD8+ T cell-derived IFN-{gamma} correlated with neuronal death. These results support the evidence that CD8+ T cells in the brain directly contribute to cognitive dysfunction following coronavirus infection in aged individuals. eTOC summaryUsing a murine model of respiratory coronavirus infection, we show that aging amplifies post-infectious cognitive dysfunction due to activated CD8+ T cells that secrete IFN-{gamma} in the brain. These data provide evidence that CD8+ T cells in the brain negatively impact post-infectious cognitive function.\nSpatial characterization of interface dermatitis in cutaneous lupus reveals novel chemokine ligand-receptor pairs that drive disease\nAuthors: Shakiba, S.; Haddadi, N.-S.; Afshari, K.; Lubov, J.

M.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574422\nChemokines play critical roles in the recruitment and activation of immune cells in both homeostatic and pathologic conditions. Here, we examined chemokine ligand-receptor pairs to better understand the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a complex autoimmune connective tissue disorder. We used suction blister biopsies to measure cellular infiltrates with spectral flow cytometry in the interface dermatitis reaction, as well as 184 protein analytes in interstitial skin fluid using Olink targeted proteomics. Flow and Olink data concordantly demonstrated significant increases in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also performed spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics of punch biopsies using digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology on CLE skin and healthy margin controls to examine discreet locations within the tissue. Spatial and Olink data confirmed elevation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands. Comparing involved versus uninvolved keratinocytes in CLE samples revealed upregulation of essential inflammatory response genes in areas near interface dermatitis, including AIM2. Our Olink data confirmed upregulation of Caspase 8, IL-18 which is the final product of AIM2 activation, and induced chemokines including CCL8 and CXCL6 in CLE lesional samples. Chemotaxis assays using PBMCs from healthy and CLE donors revealed that T cells are equally poised to respond to CXCR3 ligands, whereas CD14+CD16+ APC populations are more sensitive to CXCL6 via CXCR1 and CD14+ are more sensitive to CCL8 via CCR2. Taken together, our data map a pathway from keratinocyte injury to lymphocyte recruitment in CLE via AIM2-Casp8-IL-18-CXCL6/CXCR1 and CCL8/CCR2, and IFNG/IFNL1-CXCL9/CXCL11-CXCR3. One Sentence SummaryWe mapped chemokine orchestrators of interface dermatitis in lupus using spatial approaches on archival tissue and confirmed with fresh tissues.\nRetention of ES cell-derived 129S genome drives NLRP1 hypersensitivity and transcriptional deregulation in Nlrp3-/- mice\nAuthors: Weiss, F. D.; Alvarez, Y.; Sahu, A.; Shakeri, F.; Lee, H. E.; Gellner, A.-K.; Buness, A.; Latz, E.; Meissner, F.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573991\nImmune response genes are highly polymorphic in humans and mice, with heterogeneity amongst loci driving strain-specific host defense responses. The inadvertent retention of polymorphic loci can introduce confounding phenotypes, leading to erroneous conclusions, and impeding scientific advancement. In this study, we employ a combination of RNAseq and variant calling analyses and identify a substantial region of 129S genome, including the highly polymorphic Nlrp1 locus proximal to Nlrp3, in one of the most commonly used mouse models of NLRP3 deficiency. We show that increased expression of 129S NLRP1b sensitizes Nlrp3-/- macrophages to NLRP1 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the presence of 129S genome leads to altered gene and protein regulation across multiple cell-types, including of the key tissue-resident macrophage marker, TIM4. To address the challenge of resolving NLRP3-dependent phenotypes, we introduce and validate a conditional Nlrp3 allele, enabling precise temporal and cell-type-specific control over Nlrp3 deletion. Our study establishes a generic framework to identify functionally relevant SNPs and assess genomic contamination in transgenic mice. This allows for unambiguous attribution of phenotypes to the target gene and advances the precision and reliability of research in the field of host defense responses.\nDisease-associated astrocyte epigenetic memory promotes CNS pathology\nAuthors: Lee, H.-G.; Rone, J.

J.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574196\nAstrocytes play important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathology. Indeed, astrocyte subsets defined by specific transcriptional activation states contribute to the pathology of neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its pre-clinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)1-8. However, little is known about the stability of these disease-associated astrocyte subsets, their regulation, and whether they integrate past stimulation events to respond to subsequent challenges. Here, we describe the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset which exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon re-challenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq), focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing (FIND-seq), and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) used by the histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. ACLY+p300+ memory astrocytes are increased in acute and chronic EAE models; the genetic targeting of ACLY+ p300+ astrocytes using CRISPR/Cas9 ameliorated EAE. We also detected responses consistent with a pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased ACLY+ p300+ astrocytes in chronic MS lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, MS. These findings may guide novel therapeutic approaches for MS and other neurologic diseases.\nBCG activation of trained immunity is associated with induction of cross reactive COVID-19 antibodies in a BCG vaccinated population.\nAuthors: Iqbal, N. T.; Ahmed, K.; Sattar, T.; Aziz, F.; Hussain, R.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573408\nBackgroundDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of morbidity and mortality was considerably lower in BCG vaccinated countries like Pakistan. BCG has been shown to provide cross protection to both disseminated TB as well as non related viral infections in BCG vaccinated children which is consistent with COVID-19 morbidity in the younger age group. Recently, this cross protection was attributed to trained immunity (TI) associated with BCG recall responses in the innate arm of the immune system. Little is known about the longevity of BCG Trained Immunity (TI) beyond early childhood. ObjectiveTo assess the BCG-induced recall responses in healthy individuals by cytokines secreted from the TI network and its potential role in providing cross-protection against COVID-19 and other viral infections. Study DesignIn this cross-sectional study, healthy young adults and adolescents (n=20) were recruited from 16-40 years of age, with no prior history of TB treatment, autoimmune, or chronic inflammatory condition. MethodsBCG-induced cytokine responses were assessed using prototypic markers for cells of the TI network {macrophages [M1 (TNF, IFN{gamma}), M2 (IL10)], NK (IL2), Gamma delta ({gamma}{delta}) T (IL17, IL4)} and SARS CoV2 IgG antibodies against RBD using short-term (12 hrs.) cultures assay. ResultsSignificant differences were observed in the magnitude of recall responses to BCG with macrophage cytokines showing the highest mean levels of TNF (9148 pg/ml) followed by IL10 (488 pg/ml) and IFN{gamma} (355 pg/ml). The ratio of unstimulated vs.BCG-stimulated cytokines was 132 fold higher for TNF, 40 fold for IL10, and 27 fold for IFN{gamma}. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were also detected in unstimulated plasma which showed cross reactivity with BCG. ConclusionThe presence of cross reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the relative ratio of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by activated TI cellular network may play a pivotal role in protection in the early stages of infection as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the younger age groups resulting in lower morbidity and mortality.\nMucin-degrading gut bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity\nAuthors: Wolter, M.; Boudaud, M.; Grant, E.; Parrish, A.; De Sciscio, A.; Thompson, S.; Gerardy, J.-J.; Mittelbronn, M.; Thornton, D. J.; Macpherson, A. J.; Grencis, R. K.; Desai, M. S.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.28.482289\nBACKGROUND \u0026 AIMSHost-secreted gastrointestinal mucus plays a key role in the expulsion of intestinal nematode parasites. A balance between mucin secretion by the host and the gut microbial mucin foraging is essential to maintain the intestinal homeostasis, yet little is known about how changes in the mucin-microbiome interactions affect worm infections. Here, we aimed to examine how mucin foraging activity by the microbiome changes the course of parasitic worm infections by modulating the host immune responses. METHODSWe utilized a gnotobiotic mouse model containing a synthetic human gut microbiota that allows for: 1) a complete removal of the mucin-degrading bacteria from the community; and 2) diet-driven manipulation of the microbiota toward mucin foraging. We infected mice with a murine nematode, Trichuris muris, which resembles human infection with Trichuris trichiura. We examined the temporal dynamics of worm infection including worm burden and the host immune responses, and coupled these readouts to the microbial changes and mucin foraging activity. RESULTSThe absence of mucin-degrading bacteria in the microbiota enhances susceptibility to parasitic infection--evidenced by higher worm number--by promoting stronger Th1 immune responses. Dietary fiber deprivation increases the microbial mucin-foraging activity, which coincides with a shift in host immune responses from susceptible (chronic, Th1 type) to resistant (acute, Th2 type), thereby promoting worm clearance. CONCLUSIONSOur results provide mechanistic insights into how the colonic mucin-degrading bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity through modulation of the host immune responses. Our study documents a clinically-relevant, novel link in the microbiome-parasite-host immune axis that is useful prerequisite knowledge in managing parasitic infections.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells express antigen-specific synthetic receptors, which upon binding to cancer cells, elicit T cell anti-tumor responses. CAR T cell therapy has enjoyed success in the clinic for hematological cancer indications, giving rise to decade-long remissions in some cases. However, CAR T therapy for patients with solid tumors has not seen similar successes. Solid tumors constitute 90% of adult human cancers, representing an enormous unmet clinical need. Current approaches do not solve the central problem of limited ability of therapeutic cells to migrate through the stromal matrix. We discover that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype is mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced inflammatory cytokines that include IL5, TNF, IFN{gamma}, and IL8. We exploit this finding to &#34;lock-in&#34; a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing receptors, which we call velocity receptors (VRs). VRs target these cytokines and signal through these cytokines cognate receptors to increase T cell motility and infiltrate lung, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors in large numbers and at doses for which control CAR T cells remain confined to the tumor periphery. In contrast to CAR therapy alone, VR-CAR T cells significantly attenuate tumor growth and extend overall survival. This work suggests that approaches to the design of immune cell receptors that focus on migration signaling will help current and future CAR cellular therapies to infiltrate deep into solid tumors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytokine therapies are potent immunotherapy agents but exhibit severe dose-limiting toxicities. One strategy to overcome this involves engineering cytokines for intratumoral retention following local delivery. Here, we develop a localized cytokine therapy that elicits profound anti-tumor immunity by engineered targeting to the ubiquitous leukocyte receptor CD45. We designed CD45-targeted immunocytokines (CD45-Cyt) that, upon injection, decorated the surface of leukocytes in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) without systemic exposure. CD45-Cyt therapy eradicated both directly treated tumors and untreated distal lesions in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. Mechanistically, CD45-Cyt triggered prolonged pSTAT signaling and reprogrammed tumor-specific CD8&#43; T cells in the TDLN to exhibit an anti-viral transcriptional signature. CD45 anchoring represents a broad platform for protein retention by host immune cells for use in immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune imprinting is a phenomenon in which an individuals prior antigenic experiences influence responses to subsequent infection or vaccination. Here, using antibody depletion and multiplexed spike-binding assays, we characterized the type-specificity and cross-reactivity of serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccination in mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single priming dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling a robust generation of type-specific antibodies. However, substantial imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron mRNA vaccine. In humans who received two BA.5 or XBB.1.5 Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with circulating Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because the serum neutralizing response against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses was completely abrogated after pre-clearing with the Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes shaped and shared by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Our depletion analysis also identified cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 proteins with differential inhibitory effects on members of the sarbecovirus subgenus. Thus, although the serum antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is dominantly imprinted by prior immunizations with prototype mRNA-1273 vaccines, this outcome can be beneficial as it drives expansion of multiple classes of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and extend activity to distantly related sarbecoviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aspergillus fumigatus causes life-threatening mold pneumonia in immune compromised patients, particularly in those with quantitative or qualitative defects in neutrophils. While innate immune cell crosstalk licenses neutrophil antifungal activity in the lung, the role of epithelial cells in this process is unknown. Here, we find that that surfactant protein C (SPC)-expressing lung epithelial cells integrate infection-induced IL-1 and type III interferon signaling to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) preferentially at local sites of fungal infection and neutrophil influx. Using in vivo models that distinguish the role of GM-CSF during acute infection from its homeostatic function in alveolar macrophage survival and surfactant catabolism, we demonstrate that epithelial-derived GM-CSF increases the accumulation and fungicidal activity of GM-CSF-responsive neutrophils, with the latter being essential for host survival. Our findings establish SPC&#43; epithelial cells as a central player in regulating the quality and strength of neutrophil-dependent immunity against inhaled mold pathogens.

        <p class="abstract">Primarily a respiratory infection, numerous patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with neurologic symptoms, some continuing long after viral clearance as a persistent symptomatic phase termed &#34;long COVID&#34;. Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease, as well as incidence of long COVID. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged immune response predispose elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection and post-infectious sequelae. Using a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), we found that aging increased clinical illness and lethality to MHV infection, with aged animals harboring increased virus in the brain during acute infection. This was coupled with an unexpected increase in activated CD8&#43; T cells within the brains of aged animals but reduced antigen specificity of those CD8&#43; T cells. Aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which correlated with increased neuronal cell death and reduced neuronal regeneration in aged hippocampus. Using primary cell culture, we demonstrated that activated CD8&#43; T cells induce neuronal death, independent of antigen-specificity. Specifically, higher levels of CD8&#43; T cell-derived IFN-{gamma} correlated with neuronal death. These results support the evidence that CD8&#43; T cells in the brain directly contribute to cognitive dysfunction following coronavirus infection in aged individuals.

eTOC summaryUsing a murine model of respiratory coronavirus infection, we show that aging amplifies post-infectious cognitive dysfunction due to activated CD8&#43; T cells that secrete IFN-{gamma} in the brain. These data provide evidence that CD8&#43; T cells in the brain negatively impact post-infectious cognitive function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chemokines play critical roles in the recruitment and activation of immune cells in both homeostatic and pathologic conditions. Here, we examined chemokine ligand-receptor pairs to better understand the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a complex autoimmune connective tissue disorder. We used suction blister biopsies to measure cellular infiltrates with spectral flow cytometry in the interface dermatitis reaction, as well as 184 protein analytes in interstitial skin fluid using Olink targeted proteomics. Flow and Olink data concordantly demonstrated significant increases in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also performed spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics of punch biopsies using digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology on CLE skin and healthy margin controls to examine discreet locations within the tissue. Spatial and Olink data confirmed elevation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands. Comparing involved versus uninvolved keratinocytes in CLE samples revealed upregulation of essential inflammatory response genes in areas near interface dermatitis, including AIM2. Our Olink data confirmed upregulation of Caspase 8, IL-18 which is the final product of AIM2 activation, and induced chemokines including CCL8 and CXCL6 in CLE lesional samples. Chemotaxis assays using PBMCs from healthy and CLE donors revealed that T cells are equally poised to respond to CXCR3 ligands, whereas CD14&#43;CD16&#43; APC populations are more sensitive to CXCL6 via CXCR1 and CD14&#43; are more sensitive to CCL8 via CCR2. Taken together, our data map a pathway from keratinocyte injury to lymphocyte recruitment in CLE via AIM2-Casp8-IL-18-CXCL6/CXCR1 and CCL8/CCR2, and IFNG/IFNL1-CXCL9/CXCL11-CXCR3.

        <p class="abstract">Immune response genes are highly polymorphic in humans and mice, with heterogeneity amongst loci driving strain-specific host defense responses. The inadvertent retention of polymorphic loci can introduce confounding phenotypes, leading to erroneous conclusions, and impeding scientific advancement. In this study, we employ a combination of RNAseq and variant calling analyses and identify a substantial region of 129S genome, including the highly polymorphic Nlrp1 locus proximal to Nlrp3, in one of the most commonly used mouse models of NLRP3 deficiency. We show that increased expression of 129S NLRP1b sensitizes Nlrp3-/- macrophages to NLRP1 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the presence of 129S genome leads to altered gene and protein regulation across multiple cell-types, including of the key tissue-resident macrophage marker, TIM4. To address the challenge of resolving NLRP3-dependent phenotypes, we introduce and validate a conditional Nlrp3 allele, enabling precise temporal and cell-type-specific control over Nlrp3 deletion. Our study establishes a generic framework to identify functionally relevant SNPs and assess genomic contamination in transgenic mice. This allows for unambiguous attribution of phenotypes to the target gene and advances the precision and reliability of research in the field of host defense responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Astrocytes play important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathology. Indeed, astrocyte subsets defined by specific transcriptional activation states contribute to the pathology of neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its pre-clinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)1-8. However, little is known about the stability of these disease-associated astrocyte subsets, their regulation, and whether they integrate past stimulation events to respond to subsequent challenges. Here, we describe the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset which exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon re-challenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq), focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing (FIND-seq), and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) used by the histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. ACLY&#43;p300&#43; memory astrocytes are increased in acute and chronic EAE models; the genetic targeting of ACLY&#43; p300&#43; astrocytes using CRISPR/Cas9 ameliorated EAE. We also detected responses consistent with a pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased ACLY&#43; p300&#43; astrocytes in chronic MS lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, MS. These findings may guide novel therapeutic approaches for MS and other neurologic diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of morbidity and mortality was considerably lower in BCG vaccinated countries like Pakistan. BCG has been shown to provide cross protection to both disseminated TB as well as non related viral infections in BCG vaccinated children which is consistent with COVID-19 morbidity in the younger age group. Recently, this cross protection was attributed to trained immunity (TI) associated with BCG recall responses in the innate arm of the immune system. Little is known about the longevity of BCG Trained Immunity (TI) beyond early childhood.

ObjectiveTo assess the BCG-induced recall responses in healthy individuals by cytokines secreted from the TI network and its potential role in providing cross-protection against COVID-19 and other viral infections.

Study DesignIn this cross-sectional study, healthy young adults and adolescents (n=20) were recruited from 16-40 years of age, with no prior history of TB treatment, autoimmune, or chronic inflammatory condition.

MethodsBCG-induced cytokine responses were assessed using prototypic markers for cells of the TI network {macrophages [M1 (TNF, IFN{gamma}), M2 (IL10)], NK (IL2), Gamma delta ({gamma}{delta}) T (IL17, IL4)} and SARS CoV2 IgG antibodies against RBD using short-term (12 hrs.) cultures assay.

ResultsSignificant differences were observed in the magnitude of recall responses to BCG with macrophage cytokines showing the highest mean levels of TNF (9148 pg/ml) followed by IL10 (488 pg/ml) and IFN{gamma} (355 pg/ml). The ratio of unstimulated vs.BCG-stimulated cytokines was 132 fold higher for TNF, 40 fold for IL10, and 27 fold for IFN{gamma}. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were also detected in unstimulated plasma which showed cross reactivity with BCG.

ConclusionThe presence of cross reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the relative ratio of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by activated TI cellular network may play a pivotal role in protection in the early stages of infection as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the younger age groups resulting in lower morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND &amp; AIMSHost-secreted gastrointestinal mucus plays a key role in the expulsion of intestinal nematode parasites. A balance between mucin secretion by the host and the gut microbial mucin foraging is essential to maintain the intestinal homeostasis, yet little is known about how changes in the mucin-microbiome interactions affect worm infections. Here, we aimed to examine how mucin foraging activity by the microbiome changes the course of parasitic worm infections by modulating the host immune responses.

METHODSWe utilized a gnotobiotic mouse model containing a synthetic human gut microbiota that allows for: 1) a complete removal of the mucin-degrading bacteria from the community; and 2) diet-driven manipulation of the microbiota toward mucin foraging. We infected mice with a murine nematode, Trichuris muris, which resembles human infection with Trichuris trichiura. We examined the temporal dynamics of worm infection including worm burden and the host immune responses, and coupled these readouts to the microbial changes and mucin foraging activity.

RESULTSThe absence of mucin-degrading bacteria in the microbiota enhances susceptibility to parasitic infection--evidenced by higher worm number--by promoting stronger Th1 immune responses. Dietary fiber deprivation increases the microbial mucin-foraging activity, which coincides with a shift in host immune responses from susceptible (chronic, Th1 type) to resistant (acute, Th2 type), thereby promoting worm clearance.

CONCLUSIONSOur results provide mechanistic insights into how the colonic mucin-degrading bacteria promote anti-parasitic immunity through modulation of the host immune responses. Our study documents a clinically-relevant, novel link in the microbiome-parasite-host immune axis that is useful prerequisite knowledge in managing parasitic infections.</p>
