A.; Valdez, R.; Gherasim, C.; Gordon, A.; Liu, L.; Ho, D. D.\nScore: 1418.7, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568730\nCOVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.\nHumoral immune responses to the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA booster\nAuthors: Marking, U.; Bladh, O.; Aguilera, K.; Yang, Y.; Greilert-Norin, N.; Blom, K.; Hober, S.; Klingstrom, J.; Havervall, S.; Aberg, M.; Sheward, D. J.; Thalin, C.\nScore: 74.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572575\nContinued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly. Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were. Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.\nDeep profiling of antigen-specific B cells from different pathogens identifies novel compartments in the IgG memory B cell and antibody-secreting cell lineages\nAuthors: Claireaux, M.; Elias, G.; Kerster, G.; Kuijper, L. H.; Duurland, M. C.; Paul, A. G.; Burger, J. A.; Poniman, M.; Olijhoek, W.; de Jong, N.; de Jongh, R.; Wynberg, E.; van Willigen, H. D.; Prins, M.; de Bree, G. J.; de Jong, M. D.; Kuijpers, T. W.; Eftimov, F.; van der Schoot, C. E.; Rispens, T.; Garcia-Vallejo, J. J.; ten Brinke, A.; van Gils, M. J.; van Ham, S. M.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572339\nA better understanding of the bifurcation of human B cell differentiation into memory B cells (MBC) and antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and identification of MBC and ASC precursors is crucial to optimize vaccination strategies or block undesired antibody responses. To unravel the dynamics of antigen-induced B cell responses, we compared circulating B cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (Spike, RBD and Nucleocapsid) in COVID-19 convalescent individuals to B cells specific to Influenza-HA, RSV-F and TT, induced much longer ago. High-dimensional spectral flow cytometry indicated that the decision point between ASC- and MBC-formation lies in the CD43+CD71+IgG+ Activated B cell compartment, showing properties indicative of recent germinal center activity and recent antigen encounter. Within this Activated B cells compartment, CD86+ B cells exhibited close phenotypical similarity with ASC, while CD86- B cells were closely related to IgG+ MBCs. Additionally, different activation stages of the IgG+ MBC compartment could be further elucidated. The expression of CD73 and CD24, regulators of survival and cellular metabolic quiescence, discerned activated MBCs from resting MBCs. Activated MBCs (CD73-CD24lo) exhibited phenotypical similarities with CD86- IgG+ Activated B cells and were restricted to SARS-CoV-2 specificities, contrasting with the resting MBC compartment (CD73-/CD24hi) that exclusively encompassed antigen-specific B cells established long ago. Overall, these findings identify novel stages for IgG+ MBC and ASC formation and bring us closer in defining the decision point for MBC or ASC differentiation. ImportanceIn this study, researchers aimed to better understand human B cell differentiation and their role in establishing long-lived humoral immunity. Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, they studied B cells reactive to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens in individuals convalescent for COVID-19, and compared their phenotypes to B cells reactive to three distinct protein antigens derived from vaccines or viruses encountered months to decades before. Their findings showed that Activated B cells reflect recent germinal center graduates that may have diverse fates; with some feeding the pool of antibody-secreting cells and others fueling the resting memory B cell compartment. Activated B cells gradually differentiate into resting memory B cells through an activated MBC phase. Increased expression of the cellular metabolic regulators CD73 and CD24 in resting memory B cells distinguishes them from the activated memory B cells phase, and is likely involved in sustaining a durable memory of humoral immunity. These findings are crucial for the development of vaccines that provide lifelong protection and may show potential to define reactive B cells in diseases where the cognate-antigen is still unknown such as in autoimmunity, cancers, or novel viral outbreaks.\nIdentification of new proviral and antiviral factors through the study of the Dicer-2 interactome in vivo during viral infection in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Rousseau, C.; Lauret, E.; Kuhn, L.; Chicher, J.; Hammann, P.; Meignin, C.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.570062\nRNA interference, which has a major role in the control of viral infection in insects, is initialized by the sensing of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer-2. Although many in vitro studies have helped understand how Dicer-2 is able to discriminate between different dsRNA substrate termini, much less is known about how this translates to the in vivo recognition of viral dsRNA. Indeed, although Dicer-2 associates with several dsRNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs) that can modify its specificity for a substrate, it remains unknown how Dicer-2 is able to recognize the protected termini of viral dsRNAs. In order to study how the ribonucleoprotein network of Dicer-2 impacts antiviral immunity, we used an IP-MS approach to identify in vivo interactants of different versions of GFP::Dicer-2 in transgenic lines. We provide a global overview of the partners of Dicer-2 in vivo, and reveal how this interactome is modulated by different factors such as the viral infection and/or different point mutations inactivating the helicase or RNase III domains of GFP::Dicer-2. Our analysis uncovers several previously unknown Dicer-2 interactants associated with RNA granules (i.e. Me31B, Rump, eIF4E1 \u0026 Syp). Functional characterization of the candidates reveals pro- and antiviral factors in the context of the infection by the picorna-like DCV virus. In particular, the protein Rasputin has been identified as a novel antiviral candidate. The resources provided by this work can be used to gain a better understanding of the molecular complexes assembled around Dicer-2 in the context of antiviral RNAi and beyond.\nHiding in Plain Sight: Thymic CD8+FOXP3+Tregs sequester CD25 and are enriched in human tissues\nAuthors: Jarvis, L.

L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573232\nFor decades regulatory T cell (Treg) research has focussed on CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs, whilst characterisation of CD8+FOXP3+ Tregs has been limited by their paucity in blood. Here, by studying 98 tissues from 27 deceased transplant organ donors we demonstrate that despite representing less than 5% of circulating Tregs, fully functional, thymically derived CD8+FOXP3+ Tregs are highly enriched in human tissues particularly in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, where they reside as CD25lo/-CD8+CD69+CD103+TLR9+HELIOS+FOXP3+ Tregs. Despite lacking surface CD25 expression, CD8+ Tregs in tissue are demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR and express CD25 intracellularly. Surface CD25 expression is quickly regained in vitro, allowing cell sorting for therapeutic expansion and confirmation of their suppressive function. We suggest that these elusive cells likely play an essential but previously unappreciated role in maintaining peripheral tolerance within human tissues. One Sentence SummaryFOXP3+CD8+Tregs, expressing tissue residency markers and CD25 intracellularly, are enriched in human non-lymphoid tissues.\nGenetic Mapping of Monocyte Fate Decisions Following Myocardial Infarction\nAuthors: Koenig, A. L.; Kadyrov, F. F.; Amrute, J. M.; Yang, S.; Weinheimer, C. J.; Nigro, J. M.; Kovacs, A.; Smith, G.; Lavine, K. J.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573263\nInflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac disease and represents a viable therapeutic target for heart failure. Cardiac injury elicits recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and T-cells. Monocytes and their progeny represent are highly abundant, display incredible functional diversity, and are key determinants of myocardial inflammation. Much remains to be learned regarding mechanisms and signaling events that instruct monocyte fate decisions. We devised a genetic lineage tracing strategy using Ccr2crERT2Rosa2LSL-tdTomato mice in combination with single cell RNA-sequencing to map the fate and differentiation trajectories of monocytes that infiltrate the heart after reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). We observe that monocyte recruitment is restricted to the first 5 days following MI. Infiltrating monocytes give rise to transcriptionally distinct and spatially restricted macrophage and dendritic cell-like subsets, dynamically shift over time, and chronically persist within the myocardium. Pseudotime analysis predicted two differentiation trajectories of monocyte-derived macrophages that are initially partitioned into the border and infarct zones, respectively. Among these trajectories, we show that macrophages expressing a type I IFN responsive signature are an intermediate population localized within the border zone and promote myocardial protection. Collectively, these data uncover new complexities of monocyte differentiation in the infarcted heart and suggest that modulating monocyte fate decisions may have clinical implications.\nPorphyromonas gingivalis fuels colorectal cancer through CHI3L1-mediated iNKT cell-driven immune evasion\nAuthors: Diaz Basabe, A.; Lattanzi, G.; Perillo, F.; Amoroso, C.; Baeri, A.; Farini, A.; Torrente, Y.; Penna, G.; Rescigno, M.; Ghidini, M.; Cassinotti, E.; Baldari, L.; Boni, L.; Vecchi, M.; Caprioli, F.; Facciotti, F.; Strati, F.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573607\nThe interaction between the gut microbiota and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells plays a pivotal role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone oral pathogen associated with CRC. The oral pathobiont Fusobacterium nucleatum influences the anti-tumour functions of CRC-infiltrating iNKT cells. However, the impact of other oral bacteria, like P. gingivalis, on their activation status remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that mucosa-associated P. gingivalis induces a protumour phenotype in iNKT cells, subsequently influencing the composition of mononuclear-phagocyte cells within the tumour microenvironment in CRC. Mechanistically, in vivo and in vitro experiments show that P. gingivalis reduces the cytotoxic functions of iNKT cells, hampering the iNKT cell lytic machinery though increased expression of chitinase 3-like-1 protein (CHI3L1). Neutralization of CHI3L1 effectively restores iNKT cell cytotoxic functions suggesting a therapeutic potential to reactivate iNKT cell-mediated antitumour immunity. In conclusion, our data demonstrate how P. gingivalis accelerates CRC progression by inducing iNKT cells to upregulate CHI3L1, thus impairing iNKT cell cytotoxicity and promoting host tumour immune evasion.\nStructural basis for constitutive activation and CXCL1 recognition of human herpesvirus 8-encoded G protein-coupled receptor KSHV-GPCR\nAuthors: Liu, A.; Liu, Y.; Llinas del Torrent Masachs, C.; Zhang, W.; Pardo, L.; Ye, R. D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573477\nKaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a viral G protein-coupled receptor, KSHV-GPCR, that contributes to KSHV immune evasion and pathogenesis of Kaposis Sarcoma. KSHV-GPCR shares a high similarity with CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and can be activated by selected chemokine ligands. KSHV-GPCR is also unique for its constitutive activity by coupling to various G proteins. We investigated the structural basis of ligand-dependent as well as constitutive activity of KSHV-GPCR through cryo-EM structural determination of KSHV-GPCR-Gi signaling complexes with and without bound CXCL1 chemokine ligand. Analysis of the apo-KSHV-GPCR-Gi structure, with an overall resolution of 2.81 [A], unraveled the involvement of extracellular loop 2 in constitutive activation of the receptor. This and other structural motifs serve to stabilize the constitutively-active KSHV-GPCR. The CXCL1-bound KSHV-GPCR-Gi structure was solved to an overall resolution of 3.01 [A], and showed a two-site binding of the chemokine by the receptor. Together with functional validations, this work shed light on the structural basis for constitutive as well as CXCL1-induced activation of KSHV-GPCR. The work also demonstrates evolutionary advantage in immune evasion by KSHV through its virally encoded chemokine receptor, with potential implications in developing therapeutic strategies for KSHV infection.\nImmuno-Responsive Gene-1: A mitochondrial gene regulates pathogenic Th17 in CNS autoimmunity mouse model\nAuthors: Nematullah, M.; Fatma, M.; Rashid, F.; Ayasolla, K.; Ahmed, M. E.; Sajad, M.; Zahoor, I.; Rattan, R.; Giri, s.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573264\nPathogenic Th17 cells are crucial to CNS autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), though their control by endogenous mechanisms is unknown. RNAseq analysis of brain glial cells identified immuno-responsive gene 1 (Irg1), a mitochondrial-related enzyme-coding gene, as one of the highly upregulated gene under inflammatory conditions which were further validated in the spinal cord of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Moreover, Irg1 mRNA and protein levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells were higher in the EAE group, raising questions about its function in CNS autoimmunity. We observed that Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease and greater mononuclear cell infiltration, including triple-positive CD4 cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFN{gamma}. Lack of Irg1 in macrophages led to higher levels of Class II expression and polarized myelin primed CD4 cells into pathogenic Th17 cells through the NLRP3/IL1{beta} axis. Our findings show that Irg1 in macrophages plays an important role in the formation of pathogenic Th17 cells, emphasizing its potential as a therapy for autoimmune diseases, including MS.\nC5aR Expression in Kidney Tubules, Macrophages and Fibrosis\nAuthors: Dunlap, C.; Zhao, N.; Ertl, L. S.; Schall, T. J.; Sullivan, K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573612\nThe anaphylatoxin C5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) are complement pathway effectors implicated in renal diseases, including ANCA-associated vasculitis. We investigated the kidney expression of C5aR and a second C5a receptor C5L2 by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human and mouse kidney. C5aR was detected on interstitial macrophages and in multiple tubular regions, both distal and proximal; C5L2 had a similar expression pattern. The 5/6 nephrectomy model of chronic kidney injury exhibited increased C5aR expression by infiltrating cells within the fibrotic regions. Functional assessment of myeloid C5aR in vitro revealed that C5a induced the expression of chemokines and remodeling factors by macrophages, including CCL-3/-4/-7,-20, MMP-1/-3/-8/-12, and F3, and promoted survival by blocking neutrophil apoptosis. C5a activity was C5aR dependent, as demonstrated by reversal with the C5aR inhibitor avacopan. Collectively, these results suggest that myeloid C5aR may induce excessive inflammation in the kidney via immune cell recruitment, extracellular matrix destruction, and remodeling, resulting in fibrotic tissue deposition.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 vaccines have recently been updated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 subvariant alone, but their immunogenicity in humans has yet to be fully evaluated and reported, particularly against emergent viruses that are rapidly expanding. We now report that administration of an updated monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) to uninfected individuals boosted serum virus-neutralization antibodies significantly against not only XBB.1.5 (27.0-fold) and the currently dominant EG.5.1 (27.6-fold) but also key emergent viruses like HV.1, HK.3, JD.1.1, and JN.1 (13.3-to-27.4-fold). In individuals previously infected by an Omicron subvariant, serum neutralizing titers were boosted to highest levels (1,504-to-22,978) against all viral variants tested. While immunological imprinting was still evident with the updated vaccines, it was not nearly as severe as the previously authorized bivalent BA.5 vaccine. Our findings strongly support the official recommendation to widely apply the updated COVID-19 vaccines to further protect the public.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune escape necessitated the development of updated vaccines, and a monovalent vaccine incorporating the XBB.1.5 variant spike protein is currently being rolled out. Amidst the emergence of the highly mutated BA.2.86 lineage and against the backdrop of pronounced immune imprinting, it is important to characterize the antibody responses following vaccination, particularly in the elderly.

Here, we show that the monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted booster vaccination substantially enhanced both binding and neutralising antibody responses against a panel of variants, including BA.2.86, in an older population with four or more previous vaccine doses. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 were boosted more strongly than titers to historical variants were.

Our findings thereby suggest increased vaccine induced protection against both antigenically matched variants, as well as the more distant BA.2.86 variant, and support current vaccine policies recommending a monovalent XBB.1.5 booster dose to older individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A better understanding of the bifurcation of human B cell differentiation into memory B cells (MBC) and antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and identification of MBC and ASC precursors is crucial to optimize vaccination strategies or block undesired antibody responses. To unravel the dynamics of antigen-induced B cell responses, we compared circulating B cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (Spike, RBD and Nucleocapsid) in COVID-19 convalescent individuals to B cells specific to Influenza-HA, RSV-F and TT, induced much longer ago. High-dimensional spectral flow cytometry indicated that the decision point between ASC- and MBC-formation lies in the CD43&#43;CD71&#43;IgG&#43; Activated B cell compartment, showing properties indicative of recent germinal center activity and recent antigen encounter. Within this Activated B cells compartment, CD86&#43; B cells exhibited close phenotypical similarity with ASC, while CD86- B cells were closely related to IgG&#43; MBCs. Additionally, different activation stages of the IgG&#43; MBC compartment could be further elucidated. The expression of CD73 and CD24, regulators of survival and cellular metabolic quiescence, discerned activated MBCs from resting MBCs. Activated MBCs (CD73-CD24lo) exhibited phenotypical similarities with CD86- IgG&#43; Activated B cells and were restricted to SARS-CoV-2 specificities, contrasting with the resting MBC compartment (CD73-/CD24hi) that exclusively encompassed antigen-specific B cells established long ago. Overall, these findings identify novel stages for IgG&#43; MBC and ASC formation and bring us closer in defining the decision point for MBC or ASC differentiation.

ImportanceIn this study, researchers aimed to better understand human B cell differentiation and their role in establishing long-lived humoral immunity. Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, they studied B cells reactive to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens in individuals convalescent for COVID-19, and compared their phenotypes to B cells reactive to three distinct protein antigens derived from vaccines or viruses encountered months to decades before. Their findings showed that Activated B cells reflect recent germinal center graduates that may have diverse fates; with some feeding the pool of antibody-secreting cells and others fueling the resting memory B cell compartment. Activated B cells gradually differentiate into resting memory B cells through an activated MBC phase. Increased expression of the cellular metabolic regulators CD73 and CD24 in resting memory B cells distinguishes them from the activated memory B cells phase, and is likely involved in sustaining a durable memory of humoral immunity. These findings are crucial for the development of vaccines that provide lifelong protection and may show potential to define reactive B cells in diseases where the cognate-antigen is still unknown such as in autoimmunity, cancers, or novel viral outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA interference, which has a major role in the control of viral infection in insects, is initialized by the sensing of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer-2. Although many in vitro studies have helped understand how Dicer-2 is able to discriminate between different dsRNA substrate termini, much less is known about how this translates to the in vivo recognition of viral dsRNA. Indeed, although Dicer-2 associates with several dsRNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs) that can modify its specificity for a substrate, it remains unknown how Dicer-2 is able to recognize the protected termini of viral dsRNAs. In order to study how the ribonucleoprotein network of Dicer-2 impacts antiviral immunity, we used an IP-MS approach to identify in vivo interactants of different versions of GFP::Dicer-2 in transgenic lines. We provide a global overview of the partners of Dicer-2 in vivo, and reveal how this interactome is modulated by different factors such as the viral infection and/or different point mutations inactivating the helicase or RNase III domains of GFP::Dicer-2. Our analysis uncovers several previously unknown Dicer-2 interactants associated with RNA granules (i.e. Me31B, Rump, eIF4E1 &amp; Syp). Functional characterization of the candidates reveals pro- and antiviral factors in the context of the infection by the picorna-like DCV virus. In particular, the protein Rasputin has been identified as a novel antiviral candidate. The resources provided by this work can be used to gain a better understanding of the molecular complexes assembled around Dicer-2 in the context of antiviral RNAi and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For decades regulatory T cell (Treg) research has focussed on CD4&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs, whilst characterisation of CD8&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs has been limited by their paucity in blood. Here, by studying 98 tissues from 27 deceased transplant organ donors we demonstrate that despite representing less than 5% of circulating Tregs, fully functional, thymically derived CD8&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs are highly enriched in human tissues particularly in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, where they reside as CD25lo/-CD8&#43;CD69&#43;CD103&#43;TLR9&#43;HELIOS&#43;FOXP3&#43; Tregs. Despite lacking surface CD25 expression, CD8&#43; Tregs in tissue are demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR and express CD25 intracellularly. Surface CD25 expression is quickly regained in vitro, allowing cell sorting for therapeutic expansion and confirmation of their suppressive function. We suggest that these elusive cells likely play an essential but previously unappreciated role in maintaining peripheral tolerance within human tissues.

        <p class="abstract">Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac disease and represents a viable therapeutic target for heart failure. Cardiac injury elicits recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and T-cells. Monocytes and their progeny represent are highly abundant, display incredible functional diversity, and are key determinants of myocardial inflammation. Much remains to be learned regarding mechanisms and signaling events that instruct monocyte fate decisions. We devised a genetic lineage tracing strategy using Ccr2crERT2Rosa2LSL-tdTomato mice in combination with single cell RNA-sequencing to map the fate and differentiation trajectories of monocytes that infiltrate the heart after reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). We observe that monocyte recruitment is restricted to the first 5 days following MI. Infiltrating monocytes give rise to transcriptionally distinct and spatially restricted macrophage and dendritic cell-like subsets, dynamically shift over time, and chronically persist within the myocardium. Pseudotime analysis predicted two differentiation trajectories of monocyte-derived macrophages that are initially partitioned into the border and infarct zones, respectively. Among these trajectories, we show that macrophages expressing a type I IFN responsive signature are an intermediate population localized within the border zone and promote myocardial protection. Collectively, these data uncover new complexities of monocyte differentiation in the infarcted heart and suggest that modulating monocyte fate decisions may have clinical implications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The interaction between the gut microbiota and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells plays a pivotal role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone oral pathogen associated with CRC. The oral pathobiont Fusobacterium nucleatum influences the anti-tumour functions of CRC-infiltrating iNKT cells. However, the impact of other oral bacteria, like P. gingivalis, on their activation status remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that mucosa-associated P. gingivalis induces a protumour phenotype in iNKT cells, subsequently influencing the composition of mononuclear-phagocyte cells within the tumour microenvironment in CRC. Mechanistically, in vivo and in vitro experiments show that P. gingivalis reduces the cytotoxic functions of iNKT cells, hampering the iNKT cell lytic machinery though increased expression of chitinase 3-like-1 protein (CHI3L1). Neutralization of CHI3L1 effectively restores iNKT cell cytotoxic functions suggesting a therapeutic potential to reactivate iNKT cell-mediated antitumour immunity. In conclusion, our data demonstrate how P. gingivalis accelerates CRC progression by inducing iNKT cells to upregulate CHI3L1, thus impairing iNKT cell cytotoxicity and promoting host tumour immune evasion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a viral G protein-coupled receptor, KSHV-GPCR, that contributes to KSHV immune evasion and pathogenesis of Kaposis Sarcoma. KSHV-GPCR shares a high similarity with CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and can be activated by selected chemokine ligands. KSHV-GPCR is also unique for its constitutive activity by coupling to various G proteins. We investigated the structural basis of ligand-dependent as well as constitutive activity of KSHV-GPCR through cryo-EM structural determination of KSHV-GPCR-Gi signaling complexes with and without bound CXCL1 chemokine ligand. Analysis of the apo-KSHV-GPCR-Gi structure, with an overall resolution of 2.81 [A], unraveled the involvement of extracellular loop 2 in constitutive activation of the receptor. This and other structural motifs serve to stabilize the constitutively-active KSHV-GPCR. The CXCL1-bound KSHV-GPCR-Gi structure was solved to an overall resolution of 3.01 [A], and showed a two-site binding of the chemokine by the receptor. Together with functional validations, this work shed light on the structural basis for constitutive as well as CXCL1-induced activation of KSHV-GPCR. The work also demonstrates evolutionary advantage in immune evasion by KSHV through its virally encoded chemokine receptor, with potential implications in developing therapeutic strategies for KSHV infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogenic Th17 cells are crucial to CNS autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), though their control by endogenous mechanisms is unknown. RNAseq analysis of brain glial cells identified immuno-responsive gene 1 (Irg1), a mitochondrial-related enzyme-coding gene, as one of the highly upregulated gene under inflammatory conditions which were further validated in the spinal cord of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Moreover, Irg1 mRNA and protein levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells were higher in the EAE group, raising questions about its function in CNS autoimmunity. We observed that Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease and greater mononuclear cell infiltration, including triple-positive CD4 cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFN{gamma}. Lack of Irg1 in macrophages led to higher levels of Class II expression and polarized myelin primed CD4 cells into pathogenic Th17 cells through the NLRP3/IL1{beta} axis. Our findings show that Irg1 in macrophages plays an important role in the formation of pathogenic Th17 cells, emphasizing its potential as a therapy for autoimmune diseases, including MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The anaphylatoxin C5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) are complement pathway effectors implicated in renal diseases, including ANCA-associated vasculitis. We investigated the kidney expression of C5aR and a second C5a receptor C5L2 by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human and mouse kidney. C5aR was detected on interstitial macrophages and in multiple tubular regions, both distal and proximal; C5L2 had a similar expression pattern. The 5/6 nephrectomy model of chronic kidney injury exhibited increased C5aR expression by infiltrating cells within the fibrotic regions. Functional assessment of myeloid C5aR in vitro revealed that C5a induced the expression of chemokines and remodeling factors by macrophages, including CCL-3/-4/-7,-20, MMP-1/-3/-8/-12, and F3, and promoted survival by blocking neutrophil apoptosis. C5a activity was C5aR dependent, as demonstrated by reversal with the C5aR inhibitor avacopan. Collectively, these results suggest that myeloid C5aR may induce excessive inflammation in the kidney via immune cell recruitment, extracellular matrix destruction, and remodeling, resulting in fibrotic tissue deposition.</p>
