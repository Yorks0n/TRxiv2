R.\nScore: 653.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555815\nThe recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant, BA.2.86, which carries a substantial number of Spike mutations, has raised a global alarm. An immediate assessment of its antigenic properties and infectivity is necessary. Here, we reveal the distinct antigenicity of BA.2.86 compared with previous variants including XBB.1.5. BA.2.86 significantly evades convalescent plasma from XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfections. Key mutations that mediate the enhanced resistance include N450D, K356T, L452W, A484K, V483del, and V445H on the RBD, while BA.2.86s NTD mutations and E554K on SD1 also largely contribute. However, we found that BA.2.86 pseudovirus exhibits compromised efficiency of infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells compared to XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which may be caused by K356T, V483del, and E554K, and could potentially limit BA.2.86s transmissibility. In sum, it appears that BA.2.86 has traded its infectivity for higher immune evasion during long-term host-viral evolution. Close attention should be paid to monitoring additional mutations that could improve BA.2.86s infectivity.\nTAPIR: a T-cell receptor language model for predicting rare and novel targets\nAuthors: Fast, E.; Dhar, M.; Chen, B.\nScore: 48.8, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557285\nT-cell receptors (TCRs) are involved in most human diseases, but linking their sequences with their targets remains an unsolved grand challenge in the field. In this study, we present TAPIR (T-cell receptor and Peptide Interaction Recognizer), a T-cell receptor (TCR) language model that predicts TCR-target interactions, with a focus on novel and rare targets. TAPIR employs deep convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to process TCR and target sequences across flexible representations (e.g., beta-chain only, unknown MHC allele, etc.) and learns patterns of interactivity via several training tasks. This flexibility allows TAPIR to train on more than 50k either paired (alpha and beta chain) or unpaired TCRs (just alpha or beta chain) from public and proprietary databases against 1933 unique targets. TAPIR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when predicting TCR interactivity against common benchmark targets and is the first method to demonstrate strong performance when predicting TCR interactivity against novel targets, where no examples are provided in training. TAPIR is also capable of predicting TCR interaction against MHC alleles in the absence of target information. Leveraging these capabilities, we apply TAPIR to cancer patient TCR repertoires and identify and validate a novel and potent anti-cancer T-cell receptor against a shared cancer neoantigen target (PIK3CA H1047L). We further show how TAPIR, when extended with a generative neural network, is capable of directly designing T-cell receptor sequences that interact with a target of interest.\nThe Inflammasome Pathway is Activated by Dengue Virus Non-structural Protein 1 and is Protective During Dengue Virus Infection\nAuthors: Wong, M. P.; Juan, E. Y.; Chelluri, S. S.; Wang, P.; Pahmeier, F.; Castillo-Rojas, B.; Blanc, S. F.; Biering, S. B.; Vance, R. E.; Harris, E.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558875\nDengue virus (DENV) is a medically important flavivirus causing an estimated 50-100 million dengue cases annually, some of whom progress to severe disease. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and has been implicated as a major driver of dengue pathogenesis by inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, less is known about how DENV NS1 interacts with immune cells and what role these interactions play. Here we report that DENV NS1 can trigger activation of inflammasomes, a family of cytosolic innate immune sensors that respond to infectious and noxious stimuli, in mouse and human macrophages. DENV NS1 induces the release of IL-1{beta} in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Additionally, we find that DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation is independent of the NLRP3, Pyrin, and AIM2 inflammasome pathways, but requires CD14. Intriguingly, DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation does not induce pyroptosis and rapid cell death; instead, macrophages maintain cellular viability while releasing IL-1{beta}. Lastly, we show that caspase-1/11-deficient, but not NLRP3-deficient, mice are more susceptible to lethal DENV infection. Together, these results indicate that the inflammasome pathway acts as a sensor of DENV NS1 and plays a protective role during infection.\nγδ T cells impair airway macrophage differentiation in lung adenocarcinoma\nAuthors: Raffo-Iraolagoitia, X.

In mice, {gamma}{delta} T cells can largely be segregated into CD27+ and CD27- cells, and their functions are modulated by interactions with surrounding cells. However, which cells communicate directly with {gamma}{delta} T cells in lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. To address this, we combined flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and scRNA-seq, using an autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model and different {gamma}{delta} T cell-deficient settings. We found that {gamma}{delta} T cells were increased in tumour-bearing lungs, with an altered phenotype. CD27- and CD27+ {gamma}{delta} T cells differed in their localisation and interactions including their tropism for macrophages. Overall, we propose a model where CD27+ {gamma}{delta} T cells undermine the differentiation of tumour-associated macrophages into airway macrophages, fostering a negative outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. Determining its translatability to human health may offer new avenues for immunotherapeutic strategies. SummaryGuardians of pulmonary homeostasis, {gamma}{delta} T cells remain enigmatic regarding their role in lung adenocarcinoma. Raffo-Iraolagoitia et al. report that a subset of {gamma}{delta} T cells impairs the differentiation of tumour-associated macrophages into airway macrophages, relevant for the outcome of lung adenocarcinoma.

C.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557929\nBackgroundBooster vaccinations are recommended to improve protection against severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. With primary vaccinations involving various adenoviral vector and mRNA-based formulations, it remains unclear if these differentially affect the immune response to booster doses. We here examined the effects of homologous (mRNA/mRNA) and heterologous (adenoviral vector/mRNA) vaccination on antibody and memory B cell (Bmem) responses against ancestral and Omicron subvariants. MethodsHealthy adults who received primary BNT162b2 (mRNA) (n=18) or ChAdOx1 (vector) (n=25) vaccination were sampled 1-month and 6-months after their 2nd and 3rd dose (homologous or heterologous) vaccination. Recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins from ancestral, Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 variants were produced for ELISA-based serology, and tetramerized for immunophenotyping of RBD-specific Bmem. ResultsDose 3 boosters significantly increased ancestral RBD-specific plasma IgG and Bmem in both cohorts. Up to 80% of ancestral RBD-specific Bmem expressed IgG1+. IgG4+ Bmem were detectable after primary mRNA vaccination, and expanded significantly to 5-20% after dose 3, whereas heterologous boosting did not elicit IgG4+ Bmem. Recognition of Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 by ancestral RBD-specific plasma IgG increased from 20% to 60% after the 3rd dose in both cohorts. Reactivity of ancestral RBD-specific Bmem to Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 increased following a homologous booster from 40% to 60%, but not after a heterologous booster. ConclusionA 3rd mRNA dose generates similarly robust serological and Bmem responses in homologous and heterologous vaccination groups. The expansion of IgG4+ Bmem after mRNA priming might result from the unique vaccine formulation or dosing schedule affecting the Bmem response duration and antibody maturation.\nHow persistent infection overcomes peripheral tolerance mechanisms to cause T cell-mediated autoimmune disease\nAuthors: Yin, R.; Melton, S.; Huseby, E.; Kardar, M.; Chakraborty, A. K.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557414\nT cells help orchestrate immune responses to pathogens, and their aberrant regulation can trigger autoimmunity. Recent studies highlight that a threshold number of T cells (a quorum) must be activated in a tissue to mount a functional immune response. These collective effects allow the T cell repertoire to respond to pathogens while suppressing autoimmunity due to circulating autoreactive T cells. Our computational studies show that increasing numbers of pathogenic peptides targeted by T cells during persistent or severe viral infections increase the probability of activating T cells that are weakly reactive to self-antigens (molecular mimicry). These T cells are easily re-activated by the self-antigens and contribute to exceeding the quorum threshold required to mount autoimmune responses. Rare peptides that activate many T cells are sampled more readily during severe/persistent infections than in acute infections, which amplifies these effects. Experiments in mice to test predictions from these mechanistic insights are suggested.\nEvidence associating neutrophilia, lung damage, hyperlactatemia, blood acidosis, impaired oxygen transport, and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients\nAuthors: Ali, S. S.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558185\nBackgroundCOVID-19 severity and high in-hospital mortality are often associated with severe hypoxemia, hyperlactatemia, and acidosis. Since neutrophil numbers in severe COVID-19 can exceed 80% of the total circulating leukocytes and that they are massively recruited to infected lungs, we investigated whether metabolic acidosis mediated by the glycolytic neutrophils is associated with lung damage and impaired oxygen delivery in critically ill patients. MethodsBased on prospective mortality outcome, 102 critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: ICU-Survivors (ICU-S, n=36) and ICU-Non-survivors (ICU-NS, n=66). Blood samples were collected from patients and control subjects to explore correlations between neutrophil counts, lung damage, glycolysis, blood lactate, blood pH, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and mortality outcome. We also interrogated isolated neutrophils for glycolytic activities and for apoptosis using high-throughput fluorescence imaging complemented with transcriptomic analyses. Stratified survival analyses were conducted to estimate mortality risk associated with higher lactate among predefined subgroups. ResultsNeutrophil counts were consistently higher in critically ill patients while exhibiting remarkably lower apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed miRNAs associated with downregulation of genes involved in neutrophils apoptosis. Both CT lung damage scores and neutrophil counts predicted mortality. Severinghaus fitting of hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve revealed a right-shift indicating lower oxygen capacity in non-survivors, which is consistent with lower blood-pH observed in the same group. Levels of blood lactate were increased in patients but significantly more in the ICU-NS relative to the control group. ROC analysis followed by Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis stratified to the obtained cut-off values showed that CT damage scores, neutrophil counts, and lactate levels are predictors of mortality within 15 days following blood collection. ConclusionThe current results implicate neutrophilia as a potential player in metabolic acidosis and deranged oxygen delivery associating SARS-CoV-2 infection thus contributing to mortality outcome.\nTrem2 Agonist Reprograms Foamy Macrophages to Promote Atherosclerotic Plaque Stability\nAuthors: Patterson, M. T.; Xu, Y.; Hillman, H.; Osinski, V.; Schrank, P. R.; Kennedy, A. E.; Zhu, A.; Tollison, S.; Shekhar, S.; Stromnes, I.; Tassi, I.; Wu, D.; Binstadt, B.; Williams, J. W.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558810\nObjective: Trem2, a surface lipid receptor, is expressed on foamy macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions and regulates cell survival, proliferation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Studies examining the role of Trem2 in atherosclerosis have shown that deletion of Trem2 leads to impaired foamy macrophage lipid uptake, proliferation, survival, and cholesterol efflux. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that administration of a validated Trem2 agonist antibody (AL002a) to atherogenic mice could drive macrophage survival and decrease necrotic core formation to improve plaque stability. Approach and Results: To model a therapeutic intervention approach, atherosclerosis-prone mice (Ldlr-/-) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, then transitioned to treatment with AL002a or isotype control for an additional 8 weeks while continuing on an HFD. AL002a-treated mice had increased lesion size in both the aortic sinus and whole mount aorta, which correlated with an expansion of plaque macrophage area. This expansion was due to increased macrophage survival and proliferation in plaques. Importantly, plaques from AL002a-treated mice showed improved features of plaque stability, including smaller necrotic cores, increased fibrous caps, and greater collagen deposition. Single cell RNA sequencing of whole aorta suspensions from isotype and AL002a-treated atherosclerotic mice revealed that Trem2 agonism dramatically altered foamy macrophage transcriptome. This included upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and increased expression of collagen genes. In vitro studies validated that Trem2-agonism with AL002a promoted foamy macrophage oxLDL uptake, survival, and cholesterol efflux in culture. Conclusions: Trem2 agonist expands plaque macrophages by promoting cell survival and proliferation but improves features of plaque stability by rewiring foamy macrophage function to enhance collagen deposition.\nConcurrent administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines enhances Spike-specific antibody responses\nAuthors: Barouch, S. E.; Chicz, T. M.; Blanc, R.; Barbati, D. R.; Parker, L. J.; Tong, X.; McNamara, R. P.\nScore: 219.8, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557347\nThe bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.\nTim4 enables large peritoneal macrophages to cross-present tumor antigens at early stages of tumorigenesis\nAuthors: Joshi, S.; Rodriguez, L. L.; Morosi, L. G.; Amadio, R.; Pachauri, M.; Giacca, M.; Piperno, G. M.; Benvenuti, F.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557776\nCross-presentation of tumor antigens by subsets of macrophages at different stages along tumor progression may have divergent impacts on anti-tumoral immune responses. Here we show that TIM4+ large peritoneal macrophages (LPM) avidly capture tumor cells and cross-present tumor-associated antigens at early stages of peritoneal infiltration by ovarian cancer cells. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor TIM4 promotes maximal uptake and triggers inflammatory and metabolic gene programs in combination with cytoskeletal remodeling and upregulation of transcriptional signatures related to antigen processing. At the cellular levels, TIM4 is recruited with F-actin at the phagocytic cup and translocates in nascent phagosomes, controlling the kinetic of phagosomal acidification and cargo degradation. TIM4 deletion abrogates cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens and blunts expansion of effector CD8 T cells at tumor inception. In addition, targeting tumor antigens to LPM by PS liposomes can trigger CD8 T cell activation. Together these results suggest that TIM4 enables LPMs to scan the antigenic content of incoming tumor cells to promote immune surveillance by CD8 T cells and, at defined temporal windows, may be exploited for therapeutic purposes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant, BA.2.86, which carries a substantial number of Spike mutations, has raised a global alarm. An immediate assessment of its antigenic properties and infectivity is necessary. Here, we reveal the distinct antigenicity of BA.2.86 compared with previous variants including XBB.1.5. BA.2.86 significantly evades convalescent plasma from XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfections. Key mutations that mediate the enhanced resistance include N450D, K356T, L452W, A484K, V483del, and V445H on the RBD, while BA.2.86s NTD mutations and E554K on SD1 also largely contribute. However, we found that BA.2.86 pseudovirus exhibits compromised efficiency of infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells compared to XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which may be caused by K356T, V483del, and E554K, and could potentially limit BA.2.86s transmissibility. In sum, it appears that BA.2.86 has traded its infectivity for higher immune evasion during long-term host-viral evolution. Close attention should be paid to monitoring additional mutations that could improve BA.2.86s infectivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T-cell receptors (TCRs) are involved in most human diseases, but linking their sequences with their targets remains an unsolved grand challenge in the field. In this study, we present TAPIR (T-cell receptor and Peptide Interaction Recognizer), a T-cell receptor (TCR) language model that predicts TCR-target interactions, with a focus on novel and rare targets. TAPIR employs deep convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to process TCR and target sequences across flexible representations (e.g., beta-chain only, unknown MHC allele, etc.) and learns patterns of interactivity via several training tasks. This flexibility allows TAPIR to train on more than 50k either paired (alpha and beta chain) or unpaired TCRs (just alpha or beta chain) from public and proprietary databases against 1933 unique targets. TAPIR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when predicting TCR interactivity against common benchmark targets and is the first method to demonstrate strong performance when predicting TCR interactivity against novel targets, where no examples are provided in training. TAPIR is also capable of predicting TCR interaction against MHC alleles in the absence of target information. Leveraging these capabilities, we apply TAPIR to cancer patient TCR repertoires and identify and validate a novel and potent anti-cancer T-cell receptor against a shared cancer neoantigen target (PIK3CA H1047L). We further show how TAPIR, when extended with a generative neural network, is capable of directly designing T-cell receptor sequences that interact with a target of interest.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dengue virus (DENV) is a medically important flavivirus causing an estimated 50-100 million dengue cases annually, some of whom progress to severe disease. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and has been implicated as a major driver of dengue pathogenesis by inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, less is known about how DENV NS1 interacts with immune cells and what role these interactions play. Here we report that DENV NS1 can trigger activation of inflammasomes, a family of cytosolic innate immune sensors that respond to infectious and noxious stimuli, in mouse and human macrophages. DENV NS1 induces the release of IL-1{beta} in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Additionally, we find that DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation is independent of the NLRP3, Pyrin, and AIM2 inflammasome pathways, but requires CD14. Intriguingly, DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation does not induce pyroptosis and rapid cell death; instead, macrophages maintain cellular viability while releasing IL-1{beta}. Lastly, we show that caspase-1/11-deficient, but not NLRP3-deficient, mice are more susceptible to lethal DENV infection. Together, these results indicate that the inflammasome pathway acts as a sensor of DENV NS1 and plays a protective role during infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protecting mucosal barriers, {gamma}{delta} T cells hold promise for the development of new cancer immunotherapies. In mice, {gamma}{delta} T cells can largely be segregated into CD27&#43; and CD27- cells, and their functions are modulated by interactions with surrounding cells. However, which cells communicate directly with {gamma}{delta} T cells in lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. To address this, we combined flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and scRNA-seq, using an autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model and different {gamma}{delta} T cell-deficient settings. We found that {gamma}{delta} T cells were increased in tumour-bearing lungs, with an altered phenotype. CD27- and CD27&#43; {gamma}{delta} T cells differed in their localisation and interactions including their tropism for macrophages. Overall, we propose a model where CD27&#43; {gamma}{delta} T cells undermine the differentiation of tumour-associated macrophages into airway macrophages, fostering a negative outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. Determining its translatability to human health may offer new avenues for immunotherapeutic strategies.

SummaryGuardians of pulmonary homeostasis, {gamma}{delta} T cells remain enigmatic regarding their role in lung adenocarcinoma. Raffo-Iraolagoitia et al. report that a subset of {gamma}{delta} T cells impairs the differentiation of tumour-associated macrophages into airway macrophages, relevant for the outcome of lung adenocarcinoma.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBooster vaccinations are recommended to improve protection against severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. With primary vaccinations involving various adenoviral vector and mRNA-based formulations, it remains unclear if these differentially affect the immune response to booster doses. We here examined the effects of homologous (mRNA/mRNA) and heterologous (adenoviral vector/mRNA) vaccination on antibody and memory B cell (Bmem) responses against ancestral and Omicron subvariants.

MethodsHealthy adults who received primary BNT162b2 (mRNA) (n=18) or ChAdOx1 (vector) (n=25) vaccination were sampled 1-month and 6-months after their 2nd and 3rd dose (homologous or heterologous) vaccination. Recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins from ancestral, Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 variants were produced for ELISA-based serology, and tetramerized for immunophenotyping of RBD-specific Bmem.

ResultsDose 3 boosters significantly increased ancestral RBD-specific plasma IgG and Bmem in both cohorts. Up to 80% of ancestral RBD-specific Bmem expressed IgG1&#43;. IgG4&#43; Bmem were detectable after primary mRNA vaccination, and expanded significantly to 5-20% after dose 3, whereas heterologous boosting did not elicit IgG4&#43; Bmem. Recognition of Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 by ancestral RBD-specific plasma IgG increased from 20% to 60% after the 3rd dose in both cohorts. Reactivity of ancestral RBD-specific Bmem to Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 increased following a homologous booster from 40% to 60%, but not after a heterologous booster.

ConclusionA 3rd mRNA dose generates similarly robust serological and Bmem responses in homologous and heterologous vaccination groups. The expansion of IgG4&#43; Bmem after mRNA priming might result from the unique vaccine formulation or dosing schedule affecting the Bmem response duration and antibody maturation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T cells help orchestrate immune responses to pathogens, and their aberrant regulation can trigger autoimmunity. Recent studies highlight that a threshold number of T cells (a quorum) must be activated in a tissue to mount a functional immune response. These collective effects allow the T cell repertoire to respond to pathogens while suppressing autoimmunity due to circulating autoreactive T cells. Our computational studies show that increasing numbers of pathogenic peptides targeted by T cells during persistent or severe viral infections increase the probability of activating T cells that are weakly reactive to self-antigens (molecular mimicry). These T cells are easily re-activated by the self-antigens and contribute to exceeding the quorum threshold required to mount autoimmune responses. Rare peptides that activate many T cells are sampled more readily during severe/persistent infections than in acute infections, which amplifies these effects. Experiments in mice to test predictions from these mechanistic insights are suggested.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 severity and high in-hospital mortality are often associated with severe hypoxemia, hyperlactatemia, and acidosis. Since neutrophil numbers in severe COVID-19 can exceed 80% of the total circulating leukocytes and that they are massively recruited to infected lungs, we investigated whether metabolic acidosis mediated by the glycolytic neutrophils is associated with lung damage and impaired oxygen delivery in critically ill patients.

MethodsBased on prospective mortality outcome, 102 critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: ICU-Survivors (ICU-S, n=36) and ICU-Non-survivors (ICU-NS, n=66). Blood samples were collected from patients and control subjects to explore correlations between neutrophil counts, lung damage, glycolysis, blood lactate, blood pH, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and mortality outcome. We also interrogated isolated neutrophils for glycolytic activities and for apoptosis using high-throughput fluorescence imaging complemented with transcriptomic analyses. Stratified survival analyses were conducted to estimate mortality risk associated with higher lactate among predefined subgroups.

ResultsNeutrophil counts were consistently higher in critically ill patients while exhibiting remarkably lower apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed miRNAs associated with downregulation of genes involved in neutrophils apoptosis. Both CT lung damage scores and neutrophil counts predicted mortality. Severinghaus fitting of hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve revealed a right-shift indicating lower oxygen capacity in non-survivors, which is consistent with lower blood-pH observed in the same group. Levels of blood lactate were increased in patients but significantly more in the ICU-NS relative to the control group. ROC analysis followed by Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis stratified to the obtained cut-off values showed that CT damage scores, neutrophil counts, and lactate levels are predictors of mortality within 15 days following blood collection.

ConclusionThe current results implicate neutrophilia as a potential player in metabolic acidosis and deranged oxygen delivery associating SARS-CoV-2 infection thus contributing to mortality outcome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Trem2, a surface lipid receptor, is expressed on foamy macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions and regulates cell survival, proliferation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Studies examining the role of Trem2 in atherosclerosis have shown that deletion of Trem2 leads to impaired foamy macrophage lipid uptake, proliferation, survival, and cholesterol efflux. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that administration of a validated Trem2 agonist antibody (AL002a) to atherogenic mice could drive macrophage survival and decrease necrotic core formation to improve plaque stability. Approach and Results: To model a therapeutic intervention approach, atherosclerosis-prone mice (Ldlr-/-) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, then transitioned to treatment with AL002a or isotype control for an additional 8 weeks while continuing on an HFD. AL002a-treated mice had increased lesion size in both the aortic sinus and whole mount aorta, which correlated with an expansion of plaque macrophage area. This expansion was due to increased macrophage survival and proliferation in plaques. Importantly, plaques from AL002a-treated mice showed improved features of plaque stability, including smaller necrotic cores, increased fibrous caps, and greater collagen deposition. Single cell RNA sequencing of whole aorta suspensions from isotype and AL002a-treated atherosclerotic mice revealed that Trem2 agonism dramatically altered foamy macrophage transcriptome. This included upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and increased expression of collagen genes. In vitro studies validated that Trem2-agonism with AL002a promoted foamy macrophage oxLDL uptake, survival, and cholesterol efflux in culture. Conclusions: Trem2 agonist expands plaque macrophages by promoting cell survival and proliferation but improves features of plaque stability by rewiring foamy macrophage function to enhance collagen deposition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cross-presentation of tumor antigens by subsets of macrophages at different stages along tumor progression may have divergent impacts on anti-tumoral immune responses. Here we show that TIM4&#43; large peritoneal macrophages (LPM) avidly capture tumor cells and cross-present tumor-associated antigens at early stages of peritoneal infiltration by ovarian cancer cells. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor TIM4 promotes maximal uptake and triggers inflammatory and metabolic gene programs in combination with cytoskeletal remodeling and upregulation of transcriptional signatures related to antigen processing. At the cellular levels, TIM4 is recruited with F-actin at the phagocytic cup and translocates in nascent phagosomes, controlling the kinetic of phagosomal acidification and cargo degradation. TIM4 deletion abrogates cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens and blunts expansion of effector CD8 T cells at tumor inception. In addition, targeting tumor antigens to LPM by PS liposomes can trigger CD8 T cell activation. Together these results suggest that TIM4 enables LPMs to scan the antigenic content of incoming tumor cells to promote immune surveillance by CD8 T cells and, at defined temporal windows, may be exploited for therapeutic purposes.</p>
