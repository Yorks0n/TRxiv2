We investigated the neutralisation of isolated virus by antibodies induced by earlier infection or vaccination. The neutralisation titres for BA.2.86 were comparable to those for XBB.1 and EG.5.1, by antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 or BA.4/5 breakthrough infection or BA.4/5 vaccination.\nProtective non-neutralizing mAbs targets conserved opsonic epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 variants\nAuthors: Izadi, A.; Godzwon, M.; Ohlin, M.; Nordenfelt, P.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560084\nAntibodies play a central role in the immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. Strong evidence has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) are important for anti-SARS-Cov-2 immunity through Fc-mediated effector functions. These nnAbs bind to epitopes that could be less subjected to mutations in the emerging variants. When protective, such nnAbs would constitute a more promising alternative to neutralizing mAbs (nAbs). Here, we show that six nnAbs retain binding to Omicron, while two nAbs do not. Furthermore, two of our nnAbs, which are protective in vivo, retained binding to XBB, XBB.1.5, and BQ.1.1. They appear to bind to conserved epitopes on the N-terminal and receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively. As a proof of concept, we show that these protective non-neutralizing antibodies retain potent Fc-mediated opsonic function against BQ.1.1 and XBB. We also show that the Fc-mediated function is further enhanced by expressing the antibodies in the IgG3 subclass and combining them into a dual antibody cocktail. Our work suggests that opsonizing nnAbs could be a viable strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nImmune Correlates of Hyperglycemia and Vaccination in a Non-human Primate Model of Long-COVID\nAuthors: Palmer, C. S.; Perdios, C.; Abdel-Mohsen, M.; Mudd, J.; Datta, P.; Maness, N.; Lehmicke, G.; Golden, N.; Hellmer, L.; Coyne, C.; Moore Green, K.; Midkiff, C.; Williams, K.; Tiburcio, R.; Fahlberg, M.; Boykin, K.; Kenway, C.; Russell-Lodrigue, K.; Bohm, R.; Blair, R. V.; Dufour, J.; Fischer, T.; Saied, A.; Rappaport, J.\nScore: 57.3, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559019\nHyperglycemia, and exacerbation of pre-existing deficits in glucose metabolism, are major manifestations of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Our understanding of lasting glucometabolic disruptions after acute COVID-19 remains unclear due to the lack of animal models for metabolic PASC. Here, we report a non-human primate model of metabolic PASC using SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (AGMs). Using this model, we have identified a dysregulated chemokine signature and hypersensitive T cell population during acute COVID-19 that correlates with elevated and persistent hyperglycemia four months post-infection. This persistent hyperglycemia correlates with elevated hepatic glycogen, but there was no evidence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and pancreas. Finally, we report a favorable glycemic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered on day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that the AGM metabolic PASC model exhibits important similarities to human metabolic PASC and can be utilized to assess therapeutic candidates to combat this syndrome.\nConcurrent administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines enhances Spike-specific antibody responses\nAuthors: Barouch, S. E.; Chicz, T. M.; Blanc, R.; Barbati, D. R.; Parker, L. J.; Tong, X.; McNamara, R. P.\nScore: 231.4, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557347\nThe bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.\nMetabolic and mitochondria alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10\nAuthors: Lopez-Ayllon, B.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induce a significant mitochondrial and metabolic reprogramming in A549 lung epithelial cells. While all four ORFs caused mitochondrial fragmentation and altered mitochondrial function, only ORF3a and ORF9c induced a marked structural alteration in mitochondrial cristae. ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induced largely overlapping transcriptomes. In contrast, ORF3a induced a distinct transcriptome, including the downregulation of numerous genes for proteins with critical mitochondrial functions and morphology. Genome-Scale Metabolic Models predicted common and private metabolic flux reprogramming, notably a depressed amino acid metabolism, and an enhanced metabolism of specific lipids distinctly induced by ORF3a. These findings reveal metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities prompted by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins that may be exploited to identify new targets for intervention. One-Sentence SummaryMitochondria and metabolic alterations induced by SARS- CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c, ORF10 in pulmonary cells unravel new targets of intervention.\nMultimodal identification of rare potent effector CD8 T cells in solid tumors\nAuthors: Ray, A.; Bassette, M.; Hu, K. H.; Pass, L. F.; Samad, B.; Combes, A.; Johri, V.; Davidson, B.; Hernandez, G.; Zaleta-Linares, I.; Krummel, M. F.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559470\nAntitumor immunity is driven by CD8 T cells, yet we lack signatures for the exceptional effectors in tumors, amongst the vast majority of CD8 T cells undergoing exhaustion. By leveraging the measurement of a canonical T cell activation protein (CD69) together with its RNA (Cd69), we found a larger classifier for TCR stimulation-driven effector states in vitro and in vivo. This revealed exceptional star effectors--highly functional cells distinguished amidst progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. Although rare in growing mouse and human tumors, they are prominent in mice during T cell-mediated tumor clearance, where they engage with tumor antigen and are superior in tumor cell killing. Employing multimodal CITE-Seq allowed de novo identification of similar rare effectors amidst T cell populations in human cancer. The identification of rare and exceptional immune states provides rational avenues for enhancement of antitumor immunity.

S.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558185\nBackgroundCOVID-19 severity and high in-hospital mortality are often associated with severe hypoxemia, hyperlactatemia, and acidosis. Since neutrophil numbers in severe COVID-19 can exceed 80% of the total circulating leukocytes and that they are massively recruited to infected lungs, we investigated whether metabolic acidosis mediated by the glycolytic neutrophils is associated with lung damage and impaired oxygen delivery in critically ill patients. MethodsBased on prospective mortality outcome, 102 critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: ICU-Survivors (ICU-S, n=36) and ICU-Non-survivors (ICU-NS, n=66). Blood samples were collected from patients and control subjects to explore correlations between neutrophil counts, lung damage, glycolysis, blood lactate, blood pH, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and mortality outcome. We also interrogated isolated neutrophils for glycolytic activities and for apoptosis using high-throughput fluorescence imaging complemented with transcriptomic analyses. Stratified survival analyses were conducted to estimate mortality risk associated with higher lactate among predefined subgroups. ResultsNeutrophil counts were consistently higher in critically ill patients while exhibiting remarkably lower apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed miRNAs associated with downregulation of genes involved in neutrophils apoptosis. Both CT lung damage scores and neutrophil counts predicted mortality. Severinghaus fitting of hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve revealed a right-shift indicating lower oxygen capacity in non-survivors, which is consistent with lower blood-pH observed in the same group. Levels of blood lactate were increased in patients but significantly more in the ICU-NS relative to the control group. ROC analysis followed by Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis stratified to the obtained cut-off values showed that CT damage scores, neutrophil counts, and lactate levels are predictors of mortality within 15 days following blood collection. ConclusionThe current results implicate neutrophilia as a potential player in metabolic acidosis and deranged oxygen delivery associating SARS-CoV-2 infection thus contributing to mortality outcome.\nThe interaction between NLRP1 and oxidized TRX1 involves a transient disulfide bond\nAuthors: Geeson, M. B.; Hsiao, J. C.; Tsamouri, L. P.; Ball, D. P.; Bachovchin, D. A.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559829\nNLRP1 is an innate immune receptor that detects pathogen-associated signals, assembles into a multiprotein structure called an inflammasome, and triggers a proinflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. We previously discovered that the oxidized, but not the reduced, form of thioredoxin-1 directly binds to NLRP1 and represses inflammasome formation. However, the molecular basis for the selective association of NLRP1 with only the oxidized form of TRX1 has not yet been established. Here, we leveraged Alphafold-Multimer, site-directed mutagenesis, thiol-trapping experiments, and mass spectrometry to reveal that a specific cysteine residue (C427 in humans) on NLRP1 forms a transient disulfide bond with oxidized TRX1. Overall, this work demonstrates how NLRP1 monitors the cellular redox state, further illuminating an unexpected connection between the intracellular redox potential and the innate immune system.\nCellular RNA interacts with MAVS to promote antiviral signaling\nAuthors: Gokhale, N. S.; Somfleth, K.; Thompson, M. G.; Sam, R. K.; Marciniak, D. M.; Chu, L. H.; Park, M.; Dvorkin, S.; Oberst, A.; Horner, S. M.; Ong, S.-E.; Gale, M.; Savan, R.\nScore: 25.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559083\nImmune signaling needs to be well-regulated to promote clearance of pathogens, while preventing aberrant inflammation. Interferons (IFNs) and antiviral genes are activated by the detection of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Signal transduction downstream of RLRs proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the central adaptor protein MAVS. Recent work has shown that protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules providing allosteric regulation or acting as molecular guides or scaffolds. Thus, we hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. Here, we show that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacts with the 3' untranslated regions of cellular mRNAs. Importantly, elimination of RNA by RNase treatment disrupts the MAVS signalosome, including newly identified regulators of RLR signaling, and inhibits phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. This supports the hypothesis that RNA molecules scaffold proteins in the MAVS signalosome to induce IFNs. Together, this work uncovers a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights a generalizable principle of RNA regulatory control of cytoplasmic immune signaling complexes.\nProximal immune-epithelial progenitor interactions drive chronic tissue sequelae post COVID-19\nAuthors: Narasimhan, H.; Cheon, I. S.; Qian, W.; Hu, S.; Parimon, T.; Zang, C.; Chen, P.; Sun, J.\nScore: 36.5, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557622\nThe long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5+ basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant BA.2.86 emerged in July 2023. We investigated the neutralisation of isolated virus by antibodies induced by earlier infection or vaccination. The neutralisation titres for BA.2.86 were comparable to those for XBB.1 and EG.5.1, by antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 or BA.4/5 breakthrough infection or BA.4/5 vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies play a central role in the immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. Strong evidence has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) are important for anti-SARS-Cov-2 immunity through Fc-mediated effector functions. These nnAbs bind to epitopes that could be less subjected to mutations in the emerging variants. When protective, such nnAbs would constitute a more promising alternative to neutralizing mAbs (nAbs). Here, we show that six nnAbs retain binding to Omicron, while two nAbs do not. Furthermore, two of our nnAbs, which are protective in vivo, retained binding to XBB, XBB.1.5, and BQ.1.1. They appear to bind to conserved epitopes on the N-terminal and receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively. As a proof of concept, we show that these protective non-neutralizing antibodies retain potent Fc-mediated opsonic function against BQ.1.1 and XBB. We also show that the Fc-mediated function is further enhanced by expressing the antibodies in the IgG3 subclass and combining them into a dual antibody cocktail. Our work suggests that opsonizing nnAbs could be a viable strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hyperglycemia, and exacerbation of pre-existing deficits in glucose metabolism, are major manifestations of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Our understanding of lasting glucometabolic disruptions after acute COVID-19 remains unclear due to the lack of animal models for metabolic PASC. Here, we report a non-human primate model of metabolic PASC using SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (AGMs). Using this model, we have identified a dysregulated chemokine signature and hypersensitive T cell population during acute COVID-19 that correlates with elevated and persistent hyperglycemia four months post-infection. This persistent hyperglycemia correlates with elevated hepatic glycogen, but there was no evidence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and pancreas. Finally, we report a favorable glycemic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered on day 4 post-infection. Together, these data suggest that the AGM metabolic PASC model exhibits important similarities to human metabolic PASC and can be utilized to assess therapeutic candidates to combat this syndrome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The bivalent COVID-19 mRNA boosters became available in fall 2022 and were recommended alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of concurrent versus separate administration of these vaccines remains unclear. Here, we analyzed antibody responses in healthcare workers who received the bivalent COVID-19 booster and the influenza vaccine on the same day or different days. IgG1 responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike were higher at peak immunogenicity and 6 months following concurrent administration compared with separate administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These data suggest that concurrent administration of these vaccines may yield higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antiviral signaling, immune response and cell metabolism in human body are dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induce a significant mitochondrial and metabolic reprogramming in A549 lung epithelial cells. While all four ORFs caused mitochondrial fragmentation and altered mitochondrial function, only ORF3a and ORF9c induced a marked structural alteration in mitochondrial cristae. ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 induced largely overlapping transcriptomes. In contrast, ORF3a induced a distinct transcriptome, including the downregulation of numerous genes for proteins with critical mitochondrial functions and morphology. Genome-Scale Metabolic Models predicted common and private metabolic flux reprogramming, notably a depressed amino acid metabolism, and an enhanced metabolism of specific lipids distinctly induced by ORF3a. These findings reveal metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities prompted by SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins that may be exploited to identify new targets for intervention.

        <p class="abstract">Antitumor immunity is driven by CD8 T cells, yet we lack signatures for the exceptional effectors in tumors, amongst the vast majority of CD8 T cells undergoing exhaustion. By leveraging the measurement of a canonical T cell activation protein (CD69) together with its RNA (Cd69), we found a larger classifier for TCR stimulation-driven effector states in vitro and in vivo. This revealed exceptional  star effectors--highly functional cells distinguished amidst progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. Although rare in growing mouse and human tumors, they are prominent in mice during T cell-mediated tumor clearance, where they engage with tumor antigen and are superior in tumor cell killing. Employing multimodal CITE-Seq allowed de novo identification of similar rare effectors amidst T cell populations in human cancer. The identification of rare and exceptional immune states provides rational avenues for enhancement of antitumor immunity.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 severity and high in-hospital mortality are often associated with severe hypoxemia, hyperlactatemia, and acidosis. Since neutrophil numbers in severe COVID-19 can exceed 80% of the total circulating leukocytes and that they are massively recruited to infected lungs, we investigated whether metabolic acidosis mediated by the glycolytic neutrophils is associated with lung damage and impaired oxygen delivery in critically ill patients.

MethodsBased on prospective mortality outcome, 102 critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: ICU-Survivors (ICU-S, n=36) and ICU-Non-survivors (ICU-NS, n=66). Blood samples were collected from patients and control subjects to explore correlations between neutrophil counts, lung damage, glycolysis, blood lactate, blood pH, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and mortality outcome. We also interrogated isolated neutrophils for glycolytic activities and for apoptosis using high-throughput fluorescence imaging complemented with transcriptomic analyses. Stratified survival analyses were conducted to estimate mortality risk associated with higher lactate among predefined subgroups.

ResultsNeutrophil counts were consistently higher in critically ill patients while exhibiting remarkably lower apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed miRNAs associated with downregulation of genes involved in neutrophils apoptosis. Both CT lung damage scores and neutrophil counts predicted mortality. Severinghaus fitting of hemoglobin oxygen saturation curve revealed a right-shift indicating lower oxygen capacity in non-survivors, which is consistent with lower blood-pH observed in the same group. Levels of blood lactate were increased in patients but significantly more in the ICU-NS relative to the control group. ROC analysis followed by Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis stratified to the obtained cut-off values showed that CT damage scores, neutrophil counts, and lactate levels are predictors of mortality within 15 days following blood collection.

ConclusionThe current results implicate neutrophilia as a potential player in metabolic acidosis and deranged oxygen delivery associating SARS-CoV-2 infection thus contributing to mortality outcome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">NLRP1 is an innate immune receptor that detects pathogen-associated signals, assembles into a multiprotein structure called an inflammasome, and triggers a proinflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. We previously discovered that the oxidized, but not the reduced, form of thioredoxin-1 directly binds to NLRP1 and represses inflammasome formation. However, the molecular basis for the selective association of NLRP1 with only the oxidized form of TRX1 has not yet been established. Here, we leveraged Alphafold-Multimer, site-directed mutagenesis, thiol-trapping experiments, and mass spectrometry to reveal that a specific cysteine residue (C427 in humans) on NLRP1 forms a transient disulfide bond with oxidized TRX1. Overall, this work demonstrates how NLRP1 monitors the cellular redox state, further illuminating an unexpected connection between the intracellular redox potential and the innate immune system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immune signaling needs to be well-regulated to promote clearance of pathogens, while preventing aberrant inflammation. Interferons (IFNs) and antiviral genes are activated by the detection of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Signal transduction downstream of RLRs proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the central adaptor protein MAVS. Recent work has shown that protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules providing allosteric regulation or acting as molecular guides or scaffolds. Thus, we hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. Here, we show that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacts with the 3&#39; untranslated regions of cellular mRNAs. Importantly, elimination of RNA by RNase treatment disrupts the MAVS signalosome, including newly identified regulators of RLR signaling, and inhibits phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. This supports the hypothesis that RNA molecules scaffold proteins in the MAVS signalosome to induce IFNs. Together, this work uncovers a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights a generalizable principle of RNA regulatory control of cytoplasmic immune signaling complexes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8&#43; T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5&#43; basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8&#43; T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.</p>
