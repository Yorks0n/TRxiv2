Mucosal vaccination has been proposed as a strategy to increase protection at the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing airway immunity, potentially reducing rates of infection and transmission. Here, we compared protection against XBB.1.16 virus challenge 5 months following IM or mucosal boosting in non-human primates (NHP) that had previously received a two-dose mRNA-1273 primary vaccine regimen. The mucosal boost was composed of a bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine encoding for both SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) and delivered either by an intranasal mist or an inhaled aerosol. An additional group of animals was boosted by the IM route with bivalent WA1/BA.5 spike-matched mRNA (mRNA-1273.222) as a benchmark control. NHP were challenged in the upper and lower airways 18 weeks after boosting with XBB.1.16, a heterologous Omicron lineage strain. Cohorts boosted with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by an aerosolized or intranasal route had low to undetectable virus replication as assessed by levels of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and nose, respectively. In contrast, animals that received the mRNA-1273.222 boost by the IM route showed minimal protection against virus replication in the upper airway but substantial reduction of virus RNA levels in the lower airway. Immune analysis showed that the mucosal vaccines elicited more durable antibody and T cell responses than the IM vaccine. Protection elicited by the aerosolized vaccine was associated with mucosal IgG and IgA responses, whereas protection elicited by intranasal delivery was mediated primarily by mucosal IgA. Thus, durable immunity and effective protection against a highly transmissible heterologous variant in both the upper and lower airways can be achieved by mucosal delivery of a virus-vectored vaccine. Our study provides a template for the development of mucosal vaccines that limit infection and transmission against respiratory pathogens.

This process starts already in early fetal development and is highly active until the involution of the thymus in adolescence. To map the micro-anatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- vs. post-natal states, we undertook a spatially resolved analysis and established a new quantitative morphological framework for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis. Using this axis in conjunction with the curation of a multimodal single-cell, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging atlas, we show that canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cells are highly organised and fully established by post-conception week 12, pinpoint TEC progenitor states, find that TEC subsets and peripheral tissue genes are associated with Hassalls Corpuscles and uncover divergence in the pace and drivers of medullary entry between CD4 vs. CD8 T cell lineages. These findings are complemented with a holistic toolkit for spatial analysis and annotation, providing a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development.\nSoquelitinb, A selective inhibitor of interleukin-2-inducible kinase (ITK), is active in several murine models of T cell-mediated inflammatory disease\nAuthors: Hsu, L.-Y.; Rosenbaum, J.

A.\nScore: 36.0, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564296\nInterleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (or ITK) is a tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed by T lymphocytes. It plays a major role in T cell activation, differentiation, and receptor signaling. Studies in mouse models have established that the absence or inhibition of ITK reduces the secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines, while favoring the production of Th1 cytokines and the differentiation of T cells to regulatory T cells (T regs). We recently characterized the activity of soquelitinib (SQL), a selective, covalent inhibitor of ITK in vitro using mouse or human T cells and in vivo in murine models of cancer. We hypothesized that selective pharmacologic blockade of ITK could attenuate a variety of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases including murine models that resemble asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and acute graft versus host disease. In each model, SQL demonstrated substantial ability to ameliorate the disease process along with effects on cytokines and/or T cell subsets consistent with the reported function of ITK. Our studies demonstrate that selective inhibition of ITK by SQL is potentially a novel therapeutic approach for several forms of T cell-mediated, inflammatory diseases.\nReinstatement of RIG-I in chickens via genetic modification reveals new insights into the dynamic evolution of avian immune sensors\nAuthors: Sid, H.; von Heyl, T.; Schleibinger, S.; Klinger, R.; Guabiraba, R.; Guillory, V.; Schade, B.; Elleder, D.; Sives, S.; Vervelde, L.; Trapp, S.; Schusser, B.\nScore: 34.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.564710\nRetinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) activates mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins, initiating the antiviral response. RIG-I and RNF135, a ubiquitin ligase regulator, are missing in domestic chickens but conserved in mallard ducks. It was long believed that chickens RIG-I loss was linked to increased avian influenza susceptibility. We reinstated both genes in chickens and examined their susceptibility to the avian influenza virus H7N1. Uninfected RIG-I-expressing chickens exhibited shifts in T and B cells, while the H7N1 infection led to severe disease, persistent weight loss, and increased viral replication. Conversely, the co-expression of RIG-I and RNF135 reduced the viral replication and was associated with high inflammatory response. Our data indicate that the loss of RIG-I in chickens likely evolved to counteract deleterious inflammation caused by viral infection. We highlight the effects of restoring evolutionary lost genes in birds and suggest a new immunological approach to reduce viral replication and prevent infection.

These studies identified a spectrum of ROR{gamma}t+ APCs, distinct from dendritic cells, that included type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) as well as novel APC types. Given the discordant conclusions as to the nature of the pTreg-inducing APC and the divergent nomenclature used in these three studies, there is a clear need to reconcile these analyses and the identity of the cell types described. Our reanalysis of the single cell RNA-seq data from these studies revealed the presence of four distinct subsets of non-ILC3 ROR{gamma}t+ APCs, present in all three datasets reported, and confirmed expression of Itgb8, the critical factor for ROR{gamma}t+ APC mediated pTreg induction, in cells synonymous with the non-Aire expressing Thetis cell subset, TC IV.\nSimultaneous analysis of pMHC binding and reactivity unveils virus-specific CD8 T cell immunity to a concise epitope set\nAuthors: Kristensen, N. P.; Dionisio, E.; Bentzen, A. K.; Tamhane, T.; Kemming, J. S.; Nos, G.; Voss, L. F.; Hansen, U. K.; Lauer, G. M.; Hadrup, S. R.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565606\nKnowledge of widely recognized T-cell epitopes against common virus infections are vital for immune monitoring and characterization of relevant antigen-specific CD8 T cells and their antigen receptors. We therefore aimed to establish a concise and validated epitope panel for monitoring human virus-specific immunity complete with data on both prevalence of recognition and reactivity in humans. To achieve this, we first establish TCR downregulation, and loss of peptide major histocompatibility (pMHC) multimer-binding, as an early and sensitive marker of T cell reactivity after peptide stimulation. We next applied TCR downregulation in a high-throughput assay by monitoring binding, and loss of binding (i.e. reactivity), to libraries of DNA-barcode labelled pMHC multimers in paired unstimulated/stimulated samples. This novel method allowed us to access T-cell responses in 48 donors towards 929 epitopes recorded in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) encompassing 29 virus common infections and 25 different HLA alleles. This yielded a concise panel of 137 virus epitopes, many of which were underrepresented in the public domain, recognized by T cells in peripheral blood. 84% of these epitopes exhibited prevalent reactivity to peptide stimulation, which was associated with effector and long-term memory phenotypes. Conversely, non-reactive responses correlated with naive and immunosenescence phenotypes. This study represents the largest effort to unbiasedly assess T-cell recognition and reactivity to common virus infections in healthy individuals providing a minimal epitope panel for monitoring adaptive immune responses in humans. Significance StatementCD8 T-cell epitopes are widely available in public databases yet many are not recognized in the general population. Here we undertook an exhaustive screening process using \"state-of-the-art\" methods to assess both T-cell recognition and reactivity against common virus infections, which holds significant implications for shaping T-cell immunity and disease protection. We identify 137 commonly recognized epitopes from common virus infections to which T cell responses are expected to occur in human donors. Importantly, several of the verified epitopes were underreported in public databases compared to their observed prevalence of recognition and high cellular frequency making this an important reference dataset and resource for immunologists studying antigen-specific T cells across different immunopathologies and contexts including autoimmunity, infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy.\nIntracranial tumors elicit systemic sympathetic hyperactivity that limits immunotherapeutic responses\nAuthors: Lorrey, S.

E.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565368\nIntracranial tumors present unique challenges for immunotherapy, which can include both local and systemic immune suppression whose mechanistic underpinnings are incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that tumors harbored intracranially elicit systemic increases in catecholamines and chronic sympathetic hyperactivity that drives T cell dysfunction and limits immunotherapeutic success. Conversely, treatment with {beta}-adrenergic receptor blockade increases NF-{kappa}B activity in immune cells, restores T cell polyfunctionality, modifies the tumor microenvironment, and licenses immune-based therapies in murine models of GBM to extend survival. Extended survival was also observed in GBM patients receiving {beta}-blockers for any indication, as well as in patients with melanoma and lung cancer brain metastases who received concomitant immune checkpoint inhibition and {beta}-adrenergic blockade compared to immune checkpoint inhibition alone. These data suggest roles for increased adrenergic activity in facilitating systemic immune dysfunction in the setting of intracranial tumors, specifically, and advance a role for {beta}-adrenergic blockade in licensing immunotherapeutic responses within the intracranial compartment.\nCandida albicans suppression of neutrophil reactive nitrogen species is rescued by host Hif-1alpha in vivo\nAuthors: Burgess, T.

M.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565128\nCandida spp. cause 750,000 cases per annum of invasive disease worldwide, with up to a 50% mortality rate. Poor efficacy of current antifungals, lack of vaccines and rising antifungal resistance rates point towards an urgent need to develop new therapies. Candida albicans is a human commensal fungus that can cause life-threatening invasive infection in immunocompromised individuals. C. albicans is able to manipulate host macrophages and neutrophils to escape phagosomal killing and has previously been shown to suppress reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in vitro. However, the effects of C. albicans on RNS in vivo and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Using a zebrafish model, we aimed to characterise RNS suppression by C. albicans in vivo. We demonstrate that C. albicans suppressed neutrophil RNS both proximally and distally to the infection site in a partially active process, with heat-killed C. albicans not reducing RNS to the same extent as live fungi. Using a car1{Delta} mutant, we show that fungal arginase is partially responsible for the reduction in neutrophil RNS. Stabilisation of Hif-1, a transcription factor with a key role in immune regulation, rescued neutrophil RNS production during C. albicans infection, leading to improved infection outcomes. The protective effect of Hif-1 stabilisation was neutrophil- and nitric oxide synthase-dependent. Together, these data demonstrate that Hif-1 stabilisation can restore the neutrophil RNS response in C. albicans infection, leading to improved infection outcomes, highlighting the potential of targeting Hif-1 and RNS in host directed therapies against fungal infections.\nInterleukin-10-producing monocytes contribute to sex differences in pain resolution in mice and humans.\nAuthors: Sim, J.; O'Guin, E.; Monahan, K.; Sugimoto, C.; McLean, S.; Albertorio-Saez, L.; Zhao, Y.; Dagenais, A.; Laumet, S.; Bernard, M.; Folger, J. K.; Robison, A. J.; Linnstaedt, S. D.; Laumet, G.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565129\nPain is closely associated with the immune system, which exhibits sexual dimorphism. For these reasons, neuro-immune interactions are suggested to drive sex differences in pain pathophysiology. However, our understanding of peripheral neuro-immune interactions on sex differences in pain resolution remains limited. Here, we have shown, in both a mouse model of inflammatory pain and in humans following traumatic pain, that males had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-10 than females, which were correlated with faster pain resolution. Following injury, we identified monocytes (CD11b+ Ly6C+ Ly6G-F4/80mid) as the primary source of IL-10, with IL-10-producing monocytes being more abundant in males than females. In a mouse model, neutralizing IL-10 signaling through antibodies, genetically ablating IL-10R1 in sensory neurons, or depleting monocytes with clodronate all impaired the resolution of pain hypersensitivity in both sexes. Furthermore, manipulating androgen levels in mice reversed the sexual dimorphism of pain resolution and the levels of IL-10-producing monocytes. These results highlight a novel role for androgen-driven peripheral IL-10-producing monocytes in the sexual dimorphism of pain resolution. These findings add to the growing concept that immune cells play a critical role in resolving pain and preventing the transition into chronic pain.

H.; Kersten, K.; Kuhn, N. F.; Samad, B.; Combes, A. J.; Krummel, M. F.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.560822\nTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are frequently and simplistically categorized as immunosuppressive, and one molecule prominently used to highlight their so-called M2 state is the surface protein CD206. However, direct evidence of the impact of macrophages remains impaired by the lack of sufficiently penetrant and specific tools to manipulate them in vivo. We thus made a novel conditional CD206 knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete these TAMs. Early depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (here, MonoMacs) strikingly led to an indirect loss of a key anti-tumor network of NK cells, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8 T cells. Among myeloid cells, we found that the CD206+ TAMs are the primary producers of CXCL9, the well-established chemoattractant for CXCR3-expressing NK and CD8 T cells. In contrast, a population of stress-responsive TAMs (\"Hypoxic\" or Spp1+) and immature monocytes, which remain following depletion, expressed vastly diminished levels of CXCL9. We confirmed that the missing NK and CD8 T cells are the primary producers of the cDC1-attracting chemokine Xcl1 and cDC1 growth factor Flt3l. Consistent with the loss of this critical network, CD206+ TAM depletion decreased tumor control in mice. Likewise, in humans, the CD206+ MonoMac signature correlated robustly with stimulatory cDC1 signature genes. Together, these findings negate the classification of CD206+ macrophages as immunosuppressive and instead illuminate the role of this majority of TAMs in organizing a critical tumor-reactive archetype of immunity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Waning immunity and continued virus evolution have limited the durability of protection from symptomatic infection mediated by intramuscularly (IM)-delivered mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 although protection from severe disease remains high. Mucosal vaccination has been proposed as a strategy to increase protection at the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing airway immunity, potentially reducing rates of infection and transmission. Here, we compared protection against XBB.1.16 virus challenge 5 months following IM or mucosal boosting in non-human primates (NHP) that had previously received a two-dose mRNA-1273 primary vaccine regimen. The mucosal boost was composed of a bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine encoding for both SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) and delivered either by an intranasal mist or an inhaled aerosol. An additional group of animals was boosted by the IM route with bivalent WA1/BA.5 spike-matched mRNA (mRNA-1273.222) as a benchmark control. NHP were challenged in the upper and lower airways 18 weeks after boosting with XBB.1.16, a heterologous Omicron lineage strain. Cohorts boosted with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by an aerosolized or intranasal route had low to undetectable virus replication as assessed by levels of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and nose, respectively. In contrast, animals that received the mRNA-1273.222 boost by the IM route showed minimal protection against virus replication in the upper airway but substantial reduction of virus RNA levels in the lower airway. Immune analysis showed that the mucosal vaccines elicited more durable antibody and T cell responses than the IM vaccine. Protection elicited by the aerosolized vaccine was associated with mucosal IgG and IgA responses, whereas protection elicited by intranasal delivery was mediated primarily by mucosal IgA. Thus, durable immunity and effective protection against a highly transmissible heterologous variant in both the upper and lower airways can be achieved by mucosal delivery of a virus-vectored vaccine. Our study provides a template for the development of mucosal vaccines that limit infection and transmission against respiratory pathogens.

        <p class="abstract">T cells develop from circulating precursors, which enter the thymus and migrate throughout specialised sub-compartments to support maturation and selection. This process starts already in early fetal development and is highly active until the involution of the thymus in adolescence. To map the micro-anatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- vs. post-natal states, we undertook a spatially resolved analysis and established a new quantitative morphological framework for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis. Using this axis in conjunction with the curation of a multimodal single-cell, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging atlas, we show that canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cells are highly organised and fully established by post-conception week 12, pinpoint TEC progenitor states, find that TEC subsets and peripheral tissue genes are associated with Hassalls Corpuscles and uncover divergence in the pace and drivers of medullary entry between CD4 vs. CD8 T cell lineages. These findings are complemented with a holistic toolkit for spatial analysis and annotation, providing a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (or ITK) is a tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed by T lymphocytes. It plays a major role in T cell activation, differentiation, and receptor signaling. Studies in mouse models have established that the absence or inhibition of ITK reduces the secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines, while favoring the production of Th1 cytokines and the differentiation of T cells to regulatory T cells (T regs). We recently characterized the activity of soquelitinib (SQL), a selective, covalent inhibitor of ITK in vitro using mouse or human T cells and in vivo in murine models of cancer. We hypothesized that selective pharmacologic blockade of ITK could attenuate a variety of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases including murine models that resemble asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and acute graft versus host disease. In each model, SQL demonstrated substantial ability to ameliorate the disease process along with effects on cytokines and/or T cell subsets consistent with the reported function of ITK. Our studies demonstrate that selective inhibition of ITK by SQL is potentially a novel therapeutic approach for several forms of T cell-mediated, inflammatory diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) activates mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins, initiating the antiviral response. RIG-I and RNF135, a ubiquitin ligase regulator, are missing in domestic chickens but conserved in mallard ducks. It was long believed that chickens RIG-I loss was linked to increased avian influenza susceptibility. We reinstated both genes in chickens and examined their susceptibility to the avian influenza virus H7N1. Uninfected RIG-I-expressing chickens exhibited shifts in T and B cells, while the H7N1 infection led to severe disease, persistent weight loss, and increased viral replication. Conversely, the co-expression of RIG-I and RNF135 reduced the viral replication and was associated with high inflammatory response. Our data indicate that the loss of RIG-I in chickens likely evolved to counteract deleterious inflammation caused by viral infection. We highlight the effects of restoring evolutionary lost genes in birds and suggest a new immunological approach to reduce viral replication and prevent infection.

        <p class="abstract">Three recent contemporaneously published papers1-3 showed that antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the nuclear receptor ROR{gamma}t instruct peripheral regulatory T (pTreg) cell differentiation and establish tolerance to the gut microbiota. These studies identified a spectrum of ROR{gamma}t&#43; APCs, distinct from dendritic cells, that included type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) as well as novel APC types. Given the discordant conclusions as to the nature of the pTreg-inducing APC and the divergent nomenclature used in these three studies, there is a clear need to reconcile these analyses and the identity of the cell types described. Our reanalysis of the single cell RNA-seq data from these studies revealed the presence of four distinct subsets of non-ILC3 ROR{gamma}t&#43; APCs, present in all three datasets reported, and confirmed expression of Itgb8, the critical factor for ROR{gamma}t&#43; APC mediated pTreg induction, in cells synonymous with the non-Aire expressing Thetis cell subset, TC IV.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Knowledge of widely recognized T-cell epitopes against common virus infections are vital for immune monitoring and characterization of relevant antigen-specific CD8 T cells and their antigen receptors. We therefore aimed to establish a concise and validated epitope panel for monitoring human virus-specific immunity complete with data on both prevalence of recognition and reactivity in humans. To achieve this, we first establish TCR downregulation, and loss of peptide major histocompatibility (pMHC) multimer-binding, as an early and sensitive marker of T cell reactivity after peptide stimulation. We next applied TCR downregulation in a high-throughput assay by monitoring binding, and loss of binding (i.e. reactivity), to libraries of DNA-barcode labelled pMHC multimers in paired unstimulated/stimulated samples. This novel method allowed us to access T-cell responses in 48 donors towards 929 epitopes recorded in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) encompassing 29 virus common infections and 25 different HLA alleles. This yielded a concise panel of 137 virus epitopes, many of which were underrepresented in the public domain, recognized by T cells in peripheral blood. 84% of these epitopes exhibited prevalent reactivity to peptide stimulation, which was associated with effector and long-term memory phenotypes. Conversely, non-reactive responses correlated with naive and immunosenescence phenotypes. This study represents the largest effort to unbiasedly assess T-cell recognition and reactivity to common virus infections in healthy individuals providing a minimal epitope panel for monitoring adaptive immune responses in humans.

Significance StatementCD8 T-cell epitopes are widely available in public databases yet many are not recognized in the general population. Here we undertook an exhaustive screening process using &#34;state-of-the-art&#34; methods to assess both T-cell recognition and reactivity against common virus infections, which holds significant implications for shaping T-cell immunity and disease protection. We identify 137 commonly recognized epitopes from common virus infections to which T cell responses are expected to occur in human donors. Importantly, several of the verified epitopes were underreported in public databases compared to their observed prevalence of recognition and high cellular frequency making this an important reference dataset and resource for immunologists studying antigen-specific T cells across different immunopathologies and contexts including autoimmunity, infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intracranial tumors present unique challenges for immunotherapy, which can include both local and systemic immune suppression whose mechanistic underpinnings are incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that tumors harbored intracranially elicit systemic increases in catecholamines and chronic sympathetic hyperactivity that drives T cell dysfunction and limits immunotherapeutic success. Conversely, treatment with {beta}-adrenergic receptor blockade increases NF-{kappa}B activity in immune cells, restores T cell polyfunctionality, modifies the tumor microenvironment, and licenses immune-based therapies in murine models of GBM to extend survival. Extended survival was also observed in GBM patients receiving {beta}-blockers for any indication, as well as in patients with melanoma and lung cancer brain metastases who received concomitant immune checkpoint inhibition and {beta}-adrenergic blockade compared to immune checkpoint inhibition alone. These data suggest roles for increased adrenergic activity in facilitating systemic immune dysfunction in the setting of intracranial tumors, specifically, and advance a role for {beta}-adrenergic blockade in licensing immunotherapeutic responses within the intracranial compartment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Candida spp. cause 750,000 cases per annum of invasive disease worldwide, with up to a 50% mortality rate. Poor efficacy of current antifungals, lack of vaccines and rising antifungal resistance rates point towards an urgent need to develop new therapies. Candida albicans is a human commensal fungus that can cause life-threatening invasive infection in immunocompromised individuals. C. albicans is able to manipulate host macrophages and neutrophils to escape phagosomal killing and has previously been shown to suppress reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in vitro. However, the effects of C. albicans on RNS in vivo and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Using a zebrafish model, we aimed to characterise RNS suppression by C. albicans in vivo. We demonstrate that C. albicans suppressed neutrophil RNS both proximally and distally to the infection site in a partially active process, with heat-killed C. albicans not reducing RNS to the same extent as live fungi. Using a car1{Delta} mutant, we show that fungal arginase is partially responsible for the reduction in neutrophil RNS. Stabilisation of Hif-1, a transcription factor with a key role in immune regulation, rescued neutrophil RNS production during C. albicans infection, leading to improved infection outcomes. The protective effect of Hif-1 stabilisation was neutrophil- and nitric oxide synthase-dependent. Together, these data demonstrate that Hif-1 stabilisation can restore the neutrophil RNS response in C. albicans infection, leading to improved infection outcomes, highlighting the potential of targeting Hif-1 and RNS in host directed therapies against fungal infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pain is closely associated with the immune system, which exhibits sexual dimorphism. For these reasons, neuro-immune interactions are suggested to drive sex differences in pain pathophysiology. However, our understanding of peripheral neuro-immune interactions on sex differences in pain resolution remains limited. Here, we have shown, in both a mouse model of inflammatory pain and in humans following traumatic pain, that males had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-10 than females, which were correlated with faster pain resolution. Following injury, we identified monocytes (CD11b&#43; Ly6C&#43; Ly6G-F4/80mid) as the primary source of IL-10, with IL-10-producing monocytes being more abundant in males than females. In a mouse model, neutralizing IL-10 signaling through antibodies, genetically ablating IL-10R1 in sensory neurons, or depleting monocytes with clodronate all impaired the resolution of pain hypersensitivity in both sexes. Furthermore, manipulating androgen levels in mice reversed the sexual dimorphism of pain resolution and the levels of IL-10-producing monocytes. These results highlight a novel role for androgen-driven peripheral IL-10-producing monocytes in the sexual dimorphism of pain resolution. These findings add to the growing concept that immune cells play a critical role in resolving pain and preventing the transition into chronic pain.

        <p class="abstract">Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are frequently and simplistically categorized as immunosuppressive, and one molecule prominently used to highlight their so-called  M2 state is the surface protein CD206. However, direct evidence of the impact of macrophages remains impaired by the lack of sufficiently penetrant and specific tools to manipulate them in vivo. We thus made a novel conditional CD206 knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete these TAMs. Early depletion of CD206&#43; macrophages and monocytes (here,  MonoMacs) strikingly led to an indirect loss of a key anti-tumor network of NK cells, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8 T cells. Among myeloid cells, we found that the CD206&#43; TAMs are the primary producers of CXCL9, the well-established chemoattractant for CXCR3-expressing NK and CD8 T cells. In contrast, a population of stress-responsive TAMs (&#34;Hypoxic&#34; or Spp1&#43;) and immature monocytes, which remain following depletion, expressed vastly diminished levels of CXCL9. We confirmed that the missing NK and CD8 T cells are the primary producers of the cDC1-attracting chemokine Xcl1 and cDC1 growth factor Flt3l. Consistent with the loss of this critical network, CD206&#43; TAM depletion decreased tumor control in mice. Likewise, in humans, the CD206&#43; MonoMac signature correlated robustly with stimulatory cDC1 signature genes. Together, these findings negate the classification of CD206&#43; macrophages as immunosuppressive and instead illuminate the role of this majority of TAMs in organizing a critical tumor-reactive archetype of immunity.</p>
