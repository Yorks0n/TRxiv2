  "articleBody": " Fast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 to JN.1 under heavy immune pressure\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Yu, Y.; Xu, Y.; Jian, F.; Song, W.; Yisimayi, A.; Wang, P.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Yu, L.; Niu, X.; Wang, J.; Wang, Y.; Shao, F.; Jin, R.; Wang, Y.; Cao, Y.\nScore: 177.7, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566860\nWhile the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86's susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5+L452R+F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5+L455F+F456L+A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains have the potential to quickly accumulate mutations that enhance their immune escape during transmission, often at the cost of receptor binding.\nInsights into B Cell and Antibody Kinetics Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants Using Mathematical Modelling\nAuthors: Farhang-Sardroodi, S.; Deng, X.; Portet, S.; Arino, J.; Craig, M.\nScore: 52.2, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566587\nB cells and antibodies are crucial in protecting against infections like SARS-CoV-2. However, antibody levels decline after infection or vaccination, reducing defences against future SARS-CoV-2 infections. To understand antibody production and decline, we developed a mathematical model that predicts germinal center B cell, long-lived plasma cell, memory B cell, and antibody dynamics. Our focus was on B cell activation and antibody generation following both primary and secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aligning our model with clinical data, we adjusted antibody production rates for germinal center B cells and plasma B cells during primary and secondary infections. We also assessed antibody neutralization against Delta and Omicron variants post-primary and secondary exposure. Our findings showed reduced neutralization against Omicron due to its immune evasion. In primary and secondary exposures to Delta and Omicron, our predictions indicated enhanced antibody neutralization in the secondary response within a year of the primary response. We also explored waning immunity, demonstrating how B cell kinetics affect viral neutralization post-primary infection. This study enhances our understanding of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and can predict antibody dynamics post-infection or vaccination.\nSARS-CoV-2 and its ORF3a, E and M viroporins activate inflammasome in human macrophages and induce of IL-1α in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells\nAuthors: Abrozek-Latecka, M.; Kozlowski, P.; Hoser, G.; Bandyszewska, M.; Hanusek, K.; Nowis, D.; Golab, J.; Grzanka, M.; Piekielko-Witkowska, A.; Schulz, L.; Hornung, F.; Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Kozlowska, E.; Skirecki, T.\nScore: 33.2, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566917\nInflammasome assembly is a potent mechanism responsible for the host protection against pathogens, including viruses. When compromised, it can allow viral replication, while when disrupted, it can perpetuate pathological responses by IL-1 signaling and pyroptotic cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to activate inflammasome in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, however, potential mechanisms responsible for this response are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORF3a, E and M SARS-CoV-2 viroporins in the inflammasome activation in major populations of alveolar sentinel cells: macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. We demonstrated that each viroporin is capable of activation of the inflammasome in macrophages to trigger cell death and IL-1 release from epithelial and endothelial cells. Small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors reduced IL-1 release but weakly affected the pyroptosis. Importantly, we discovered that while SARS-CoV-2 could not infect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells it induced IL-1 and IL-33 release. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of macrophages as the major inflammasome-activating cell population in the lungs and point to endothelial cell expressed IL-1 as a potential novel component driving the pulmonary immunothromobosis in COVID-19.\nRobust detection of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in population using T-cell repertoire profiling\nAuthors: Vlasova, E.

A.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566227\nThe COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates the need to monitor the spread of infectious diseases and population immunity. Probing adaptive immunity by sequencing the repertoire of antigen receptors (Rep-Seq) encoding specificity and immunological memory has become a method of choice for immunology studies. Rep-Seq can detect the imprint of past and ongoing infections and study individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 as shown in a number of recent studies. Here we apply a machine learning approach to two large datasets with more than 1200 high-quality repertoires from healthy and COVID-19-convalescent donor repertoires to infer T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire features that were induced by SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Proper standardization of Rep-Seq batches, access to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and both - and {beta}-chain sequences of TCRs allowed us to generate a high-quality biomarker database and build a robust and highly accurate classifier for COVID-19 exposure applicable to individual TCR repertoires obtained using different protocols, paving a way to Rep-Seq-based immune status assessment in large cohorts of donors.\nIntegration of ζ-deficient CARs into the CD3-zeta gene conveys potent cytotoxicity in T and NK cells\nAuthors: Kath, J.; Franke, C.; Drosdek, V.; Du, W.; Glaser, V.; Fuster-Garcia, C.; Stein, M.; Zittel, T.; Schulenberg, S.; Porter, C. E.; Andersch, L.; Kuenkele, A.; Alcaniz, J.; Hoffmann, J.; Abken, H.; Abou-el-Enein, M.; Pruss, A.; Suzuki, M.; Cathomen, T.; Stripecke, R.; Volk, H.-D.; Reinke, P.; Schmueck-Henneresse, M.; Wagner, D. L.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.565518\nI.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-reprogrammed immune cells hold significant therapeutic potential for oncology, autoimmune diseases, transplant medicine, and infections. All approved CAR-T therapies rely on personalized manufacturing using undirected viral gene transfer, which results in non-physiological regulation of CAR-signaling and limits their accessibility due to logistical challenges, high costs and biosafety requirements. Here, we propose a novel approach utilizing CRISPR-Cas gene editing to redirect T cells and natural killer (NK) cells with CARs. By transferring shorter, truncated CAR-transgenes lacking a main activation domain into the human CD3{zeta} (CD247) gene, functional CAR fusion-genes are generated that exploit the endogenous CD3{zeta} gene as the CARs activation domain. Repurposing this T/NK-cell lineage gene facilitated physiological regulation of CAR-expression and reprogramming of various immune cell types, including conventional T cells, TCR{gamma}/{delta} T cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells. In T cells, CD3{zeta} in-frame fusion eliminated TCR surface expression, reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic off-the-shelf settings. CD3{zeta}-CD19-CAR-T cells exhibited comparable leukemia control to T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC)-replaced and lentivirus-transduced CAR-T cells in vivo. Tuning of CD3{zeta}-CAR-expression levels significantly improved the in vivo efficacy. Compared to TRAC-edited CAR-T cells, integration of a Her2-CAR into CD3{zeta} conveyed similar in vitro tumor lysis but reduced susceptibility to activation-induced cell death and differentiation, presumably due to lower CAR-expression levels. Notably, CD3{zeta} gene editing enabled reprogramming of NK cells without impairing their canonical functions. Thus, CD3{zeta} gene editing is a promising platform for the development of allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapies using redirected killer lymphocytes. Key pointsO_LIIntegration of {zeta}-deficient CARs into CD3{zeta} gene allows generation of functional TCR-ablated CAR-T cells for allogeneic off-the-shelf use C_LIO_LICD3{zeta}-editing platform allows CAR reprogramming of NK cells without affecting their canonical functions C_LI\nIdentification of mouse CD4+ T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 spike and nucleocapsid for use in peptide:MHCII tetramers\nAuthors: Bricio Moreno, L.; Barreto de Albuquerque, J.; Neary, J. M.; Nguyen, T.; Hastie, K. M.; Landeras-Bueno, S.; Hariharan, C.; Nathan, A.; Getz, M. A.; Gayton, A. C.; Khatri, A.; Gaiha, G. D.; Saphire, E. O.; Luster, A. D.; Moon, J. J.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.566918\nUnderstanding adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a major requisite for the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. CD4+ T cells play an integral role in this process primarily by generating antiviral cytokines and providing help to antibody-producing B cells. To empower detailed studies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses in mouse models, we comprehensively mapped I-Ab restricted epitopes for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the BA.1 variant of concern via IFN{gamma} ELISpot assay. This was followed by the generation of corresponding peptide:MHCII tetramer reagents to directly stain epitope-specific T cells. Using this rigorous validation strategy, we identified 6 reliably immunogenic epitopes in spike and 3 in nucleocapsid, all of which are conserved in the ancestral Wuhan strain. We also validated a previously identified epitope from Wuhan that is absent in BA.1. These epitopes and tetramers will be invaluable tools for SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4+ T cell studies in mice.\nMonocyte-derived microglia with Dnmt3a mutation cause motor pathology in aging mice\nAuthors: Kim, J.-S.; Trzebanski, S.; Shin, S.-H.; Ilani, N. C.; Kaushansky, N.; Scheller, M.; Solomon, A.; Liu, Z.; Aust, O.; Boura-Halfon, S.; Amann, L.; Prinz, M.; Ginhoux, F.; Avraham, R.; Mueller-Tidow, C.; Uderhardt, S.; Milenkovic, I.; Shlush, L.; Jung, S.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567402\nMicroglia are established in embryogenesis forming a self-containing cellular compartment resisting seeding with cells derived from adult definitive hematopoiesis. We report that monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) accumulate in the brain of aging mice with distinct topology, including the nigrostriatum and medulla, but not the frontal cortex. Parenchymal MoMF adopt bona fide microglia expression profiles. Unlike microglia, these monocyte-derived microglia (MoMg) are due to their hematopoietic origin targets of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Using a chimeric transfer model, we show that hematopoietic expression of DNMT3AR822H, a prominent mutation in human CH, renders MoMg pathogenic promoting motor deficits resembling atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Collectively, these data establish in a mouse model that MoMg progressively seed the brains of aging healthy mice, accumulate in selected areas, and, when carrying a somatic mutation associated with CH, can contribute to brain pathology.\nIntestinal cDC1s provide IL-12 dependent and independent functions required for CD4+ T cell mediated resistance to Cryptosporidium\nAuthors: Cohn, I. S.; Wallbank, B. A.; Haskins, B. E.; O'Dea, K. M.; Pardy, R. D.; Shaw, S.; Merolle, M. I.; Gullicksrud, J.; Christian, D. A.; Striepen, B.; Hunter, C. A.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566669\nCryptosporidium is an enteric pathogen that is a prominent cause of diarrheal disease. Control of this infection requires CD4+ T cells, though the processes that lead to T cell-mediated resistance have been difficult to assess. Here, Cryptosporidium parasites that express MHCII-restricted model antigens were generated to dissect the early events that influence CD4+ T cell priming and effector function. These studies highlight that parasite-specific CD4+ T cells are primed in the draining mesenteric lymph node (mesLN) and differentiate into Th1 cells in the gut, where they mediate IFN-{gamma}-dependent control of the infection. Although type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) were not required for initial priming of CD4+ T cells, cDC1s were required for CD4+ T cell expansion and gut homing. cDC1s were also a major source of IL-12 that was not required for priming but promoted full differentiation of CD4+ T cells and local production of IFN-{gamma}. Together, these studies reveal distinct roles for cDC1s in shaping CD4+ T cell responses to enteric infection: first to drive early expansion in the mesLN and second to drive effector responses in the gut. SummaryCryptosporidium parasites that express model antigens were generated to dissect how parasite-specific CD4+ T cells are primed and mediate effector functions required to control this enteric pathogen. cDC1s produced IL-12p40 and were required for early expansion and gut homing of CD4+ T cells. However, IL-12p40 was only required for the development of Th1 CD4+ T cell effector function in the gut.\nA modular platform to display multiple hemagglutinin subtypes on a single immunogen\nAuthors: Lamson, D. T.; Mohamed, F. A. N.; Vu, M.; Maurer, D. P.; Ronsard, L.; Lingwood, D.; Schmidt, A. G.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566478\nNext-generation influenza vaccines aim to elicit cross-reactive humoral responses to multiple influenza subtypes. Such increased breadth would not only improve seasonal vaccines but may afford universal protection against influenza subtypes including those with pandemic potential. Here, we describe a \"beads-on-a-string\" (BOAS) immunogen, that tandemly links up to eight distinct hemagglutinin (HA) head domains from circulating and non-circulating influenzas. These BOAS are immunogenic in the murine model and elicit comparable serum responses to each individual component. Notably, we also find that BOAS elicit cross-reactive, and neutralizing responses to influenza subtypes not included in the immunizing immunogen. Furthermore, BOAS conjugation to protein-based ferritin nanoparticles does not significantly augment serum responses suggesting that our BOAS platform is sufficient for eliciting cross-reactive responses without off-target effects induced by the nanoparticle scaffold. This mix-and-match immunogen design strategy is a robust platform for eliciting responses to multiple influenza subtypes via a single immunogen, and a potential platform for other viral glycoproteins.\nMucosal Adenoviral-vectored Vaccine Boosting Durably Prevents XBB.1.16 Infection in Nonhuman Primates\nAuthors: Gagne, M.; Flynn, B.

Mucosal vaccination has been proposed as a strategy to increase protection at the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing airway immunity, potentially reducing rates of infection and transmission. Here, we compared protection against XBB.1.16 virus challenge 5 months following IM or mucosal boosting in non-human primates (NHP) that had previously received a two-dose mRNA-1273 primary vaccine regimen. The mucosal boost was composed of a bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine encoding for both SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) and delivered either by an intranasal mist or an inhaled aerosol. An additional group of animals was boosted by the IM route with bivalent WA1/BA.5 spike-matched mRNA (mRNA-1273.222) as a benchmark control. NHP were challenged in the upper and lower airways 18 weeks after boosting with XBB.1.16, a heterologous Omicron lineage strain. Cohorts boosted with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by an aerosolized or intranasal route had low to undetectable virus replication as assessed by levels of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and nose, respectively. In contrast, animals that received the mRNA-1273.222 boost by the IM route showed minimal protection against virus replication in the upper airway but substantial reduction of virus RNA levels in the lower airway. Immune analysis showed that the mucosal vaccines elicited more durable antibody and T cell responses than the IM vaccine. Protection elicited by the aerosolized vaccine was associated with mucosal IgG and IgA responses, whereas protection elicited by intranasal delivery was mediated primarily by mucosal IgA. Thus, durable immunity and effective protection against a highly transmissible heterologous variant in both the upper and lower airways can be achieved by mucosal delivery of a virus-vectored vaccine. Our study provides a template for the development of mucosal vaccines that limit infection and transmission against respiratory pathogens.

        <p class="abstract">While the BA.2.86 variant demonstrated significant antigenic drift and enhanced ACE2 binding affinity, its ability to evade humoral immunity was relatively moderate compared to dominant strains like EG.5 and HK.3. However, the emergence of a new subvariant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), which possesses an additional spike mutation, L455S, compared to BA.2.86, showed a markedly increased prevalence in Europe and North America, especially in France. Here, we found that L455S of JN.1 significantly enhances immune evasion capabilities at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. This mutation enables JN.1 to effectively evade Class 1 neutralizing antibodies, offsetting BA.2.86&#39;s susceptibility and thus allowing it to outcompete both its precursor BA.2.86 and the prevailing variants HV.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L452R&#43;F456L) and JD.1.1 (XBB.1.5&#43;L455F&#43;F456L&#43;A475V) in terms of humoral immune evasion. The rapid evolution from BA.2.86 to JN.1, similar to the earlier transition from BA.2.75 to CH.1.1, highlights the importance of closely monitoring strains with high ACE2 binding affinity and distinct antigenicity, despite their unremarkable immune evasion capabilities. Such strains have the potential to quickly accumulate mutations that enhance their immune escape during transmission, often at the cost of receptor binding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">B cells and antibodies are crucial in protecting against infections like SARS-CoV-2. However, antibody levels decline after infection or vaccination, reducing defences against future SARS-CoV-2 infections. To understand antibody production and decline, we developed a mathematical model that predicts germinal center B cell, long-lived plasma cell, memory B cell, and antibody dynamics. Our focus was on B cell activation and antibody generation following both primary and secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aligning our model with clinical data, we adjusted antibody production rates for germinal center B cells and plasma B cells during primary and secondary infections. We also assessed antibody neutralization against Delta and Omicron variants post-primary and secondary exposure. Our findings showed reduced neutralization against Omicron due to its immune evasion. In primary and secondary exposures to Delta and Omicron, our predictions indicated enhanced antibody neutralization in the secondary response within a year of the primary response. We also explored waning immunity, demonstrating how B cell kinetics affect viral neutralization post-primary infection. This study enhances our understanding of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and can predict antibody dynamics post-infection or vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammasome assembly is a potent mechanism responsible for the host protection against pathogens, including viruses. When compromised, it can allow viral replication, while when disrupted, it can perpetuate pathological responses by IL-1 signaling and pyroptotic cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to activate inflammasome in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, however, potential mechanisms responsible for this response are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORF3a, E and M SARS-CoV-2 viroporins in the inflammasome activation in major populations of alveolar sentinel cells: macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. We demonstrated that each viroporin is capable of activation of the inflammasome in macrophages to trigger cell death and IL-1 release from epithelial and endothelial cells. Small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors reduced IL-1 release but weakly affected the pyroptosis. Importantly, we discovered that while SARS-CoV-2 could not infect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells it induced IL-1 and IL-33 release. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of macrophages as the major inflammasome-activating cell population in the lungs and point to endothelial cell expressed IL-1 as a potential novel component driving the pulmonary immunothromobosis in COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates the need to monitor the spread of infectious diseases and population immunity. Probing adaptive immunity by sequencing the repertoire of antigen receptors (Rep-Seq) encoding specificity and immunological memory has become a method of choice for immunology studies. Rep-Seq can detect the imprint of past and ongoing infections and study individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 as shown in a number of recent studies. Here we apply a machine learning approach to two large datasets with more than 1200 high-quality repertoires from healthy and COVID-19-convalescent donor repertoires to infer T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire features that were induced by SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Proper standardization of Rep-Seq batches, access to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and both - and {beta}-chain sequences of TCRs allowed us to generate a high-quality biomarker database and build a robust and highly accurate classifier for COVID-19 exposure applicable to individual TCR repertoires obtained using different protocols, paving a way to Rep-Seq-based immune status assessment in large cohorts of donors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">I.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-reprogrammed immune cells hold significant therapeutic potential for oncology, autoimmune diseases, transplant medicine, and infections. All approved CAR-T therapies rely on personalized manufacturing using undirected viral gene transfer, which results in non-physiological regulation of CAR-signaling and limits their accessibility due to logistical challenges, high costs and biosafety requirements. Here, we propose a novel approach utilizing CRISPR-Cas gene editing to redirect T cells and natural killer (NK) cells with CARs. By transferring shorter, truncated CAR-transgenes lacking a main activation domain into the human CD3{zeta} (CD247) gene, functional CAR fusion-genes are generated that exploit the endogenous CD3{zeta} gene as the CARs activation domain. Repurposing this T/NK-cell lineage gene facilitated physiological regulation of CAR-expression and reprogramming of various immune cell types, including conventional T cells, TCR{gamma}/{delta} T cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells. In T cells, CD3{zeta} in-frame fusion eliminated TCR surface expression, reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic off-the-shelf settings. CD3{zeta}-CD19-CAR-T cells exhibited comparable leukemia control to T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC)-replaced and lentivirus-transduced CAR-T cells in vivo. Tuning of CD3{zeta}-CAR-expression levels significantly improved the in vivo efficacy. Compared to TRAC-edited CAR-T cells, integration of a Her2-CAR into CD3{zeta} conveyed similar in vitro tumor lysis but reduced susceptibility to activation-induced cell death and differentiation, presumably due to lower CAR-expression levels. Notably, CD3{zeta} gene editing enabled reprogramming of NK cells without impairing their canonical functions. Thus, CD3{zeta} gene editing is a promising platform for the development of allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapies using redirected killer lymphocytes.

        <p class="abstract">Understanding adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a major requisite for the development of effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. CD4&#43; T cells play an integral role in this process primarily by generating antiviral cytokines and providing help to antibody-producing B cells. To empower detailed studies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4&#43; T cell responses in mouse models, we comprehensively mapped I-Ab restricted epitopes for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the BA.1 variant of concern via IFN{gamma} ELISpot assay. This was followed by the generation of corresponding peptide:MHCII tetramer reagents to directly stain epitope-specific T cells. Using this rigorous validation strategy, we identified 6 reliably immunogenic epitopes in spike and 3 in nucleocapsid, all of which are conserved in the ancestral Wuhan strain. We also validated a previously identified epitope from Wuhan that is absent in BA.1. These epitopes and tetramers will be invaluable tools for SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4&#43; T cell studies in mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microglia are established in embryogenesis forming a self-containing cellular compartment resisting seeding with cells derived from adult definitive hematopoiesis. We report that monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) accumulate in the brain of aging mice with distinct topology, including the nigrostriatum and medulla, but not the frontal cortex. Parenchymal MoMF adopt bona fide microglia expression profiles. Unlike microglia, these monocyte-derived microglia (MoMg) are due to their hematopoietic origin targets of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Using a chimeric transfer model, we show that hematopoietic expression of DNMT3AR822H, a prominent mutation in human CH, renders MoMg pathogenic promoting motor deficits resembling atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Collectively, these data establish in a mouse model that MoMg progressively seed the brains of aging healthy mice, accumulate in selected areas, and, when carrying a somatic mutation associated with CH, can contribute to brain pathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryptosporidium is an enteric pathogen that is a prominent cause of diarrheal disease. Control of this infection requires CD4&#43; T cells, though the processes that lead to T cell-mediated resistance have been difficult to assess. Here, Cryptosporidium parasites that express MHCII-restricted model antigens were generated to dissect the early events that influence CD4&#43; T cell priming and effector function. These studies highlight that parasite-specific CD4&#43; T cells are primed in the draining mesenteric lymph node (mesLN) and differentiate into Th1 cells in the gut, where they mediate IFN-{gamma}-dependent control of the infection. Although type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) were not required for initial priming of CD4&#43; T cells, cDC1s were required for CD4&#43; T cell expansion and gut homing. cDC1s were also a major source of IL-12 that was not required for priming but promoted full differentiation of CD4&#43; T cells and local production of IFN-{gamma}. Together, these studies reveal distinct roles for cDC1s in shaping CD4&#43; T cell responses to enteric infection: first to drive early expansion in the mesLN and second to drive effector responses in the gut.

SummaryCryptosporidium parasites that express model antigens were generated to dissect how parasite-specific CD4&#43; T cells are primed and mediate effector functions required to control this enteric pathogen. cDC1s produced IL-12p40 and were required for early expansion and gut homing of CD4&#43; T cells. However, IL-12p40 was only required for the development of Th1 CD4&#43; T cell effector function in the gut.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Next-generation influenza vaccines aim to elicit cross-reactive humoral responses to multiple influenza subtypes. Such increased breadth would not only improve seasonal vaccines but may afford  universal protection against influenza subtypes including those with pandemic potential. Here, we describe a &#34;beads-on-a-string&#34; (BOAS) immunogen, that tandemly links up to eight distinct hemagglutinin (HA) head domains from circulating and non-circulating influenzas. These BOAS are immunogenic in the murine model and elicit comparable serum responses to each individual component. Notably, we also find that BOAS elicit cross-reactive, and neutralizing responses to influenza subtypes not included in the immunizing immunogen. Furthermore, BOAS conjugation to protein-based ferritin nanoparticles does not significantly augment serum responses suggesting that our BOAS platform is sufficient for eliciting cross-reactive responses without off-target effects induced by the nanoparticle scaffold. This mix-and-match immunogen design strategy is a robust platform for eliciting responses to multiple influenza subtypes via a single immunogen, and a potential platform for other viral glycoproteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Waning immunity and continued virus evolution have limited the durability of protection from symptomatic infection mediated by intramuscularly (IM)-delivered mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 although protection from severe disease remains high. Mucosal vaccination has been proposed as a strategy to increase protection at the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing airway immunity, potentially reducing rates of infection and transmission. Here, we compared protection against XBB.1.16 virus challenge 5 months following IM or mucosal boosting in non-human primates (NHP) that had previously received a two-dose mRNA-1273 primary vaccine regimen. The mucosal boost was composed of a bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine encoding for both SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) and delivered either by an intranasal mist or an inhaled aerosol. An additional group of animals was boosted by the IM route with bivalent WA1/BA.5 spike-matched mRNA (mRNA-1273.222) as a benchmark control. NHP were challenged in the upper and lower airways 18 weeks after boosting with XBB.1.16, a heterologous Omicron lineage strain. Cohorts boosted with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by an aerosolized or intranasal route had low to undetectable virus replication as assessed by levels of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and nose, respectively. In contrast, animals that received the mRNA-1273.222 boost by the IM route showed minimal protection against virus replication in the upper airway but substantial reduction of virus RNA levels in the lower airway. Immune analysis showed that the mucosal vaccines elicited more durable antibody and T cell responses than the IM vaccine. Protection elicited by the aerosolized vaccine was associated with mucosal IgG and IgA responses, whereas protection elicited by intranasal delivery was mediated primarily by mucosal IgA. Thus, durable immunity and effective protection against a highly transmissible heterologous variant in both the upper and lower airways can be achieved by mucosal delivery of a virus-vectored vaccine. Our study provides a template for the development of mucosal vaccines that limit infection and transmission against respiratory pathogens.
