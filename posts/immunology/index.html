The recent post-COVID-19 condition, which shares similarities with ME/CFS and FM, has raised concerns about viral-induced transcriptome changes in post-viral syndromes. Viral infections, and other types of stress, are known to unleash human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) repression that if maintained could lead to symptom chronicity. This study evaluated this possibility for ME/CFS and FM on a selected cohort of female patients complying with diagnosis criteria for ME/CFS, FM, or both, and matched healthy controls (n=43). The results show specific HERV fingerprints for each disease, confirming biological differences between ME/CFS and FM. Unexpectedly, HERV profiles segregated patients that met both ME/CFS and FM clinical criteria from patients complying only with ME or FM criteria, while clearly differentiating patients from healthy subjects, supporting that the highly prevalent comorbidity condition must constitute a different nosological entity. Moreover, HERV profiles exposed significant quantitative differences within the ME/CFS group that correlated with differences in immune gene expression and patient symptomatology, supporting ME/CFS patient subtyping and confirming immunological disturbances in this disease. Pending issues include validation of HERV profiles as disease biomarkers of post-viral syndromes and understanding the role of HERV during infection and beyond.\nNeutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.86 and EG.5.1 by antibodies induced by earlier infection or vaccination\nAuthors: Lassauniere, R.; Polacek, C.; Baig, S.; Ellegaard, K.; Escobar-Herrera, L.

We investigated the neutralisation of isolated virus by antibodies induced by earlier infection or vaccination. The neutralisation titres for BA.2.86 were comparable to those for XBB.1 and EG.5.1, by antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 or BA.4/5 breakthrough infection or BA.4/5 vaccination.\nQuantifying Adaptive Evolution of the Human Immune Cell Landscape\nAuthors: Salvador-Martinez, I.; Murga-Moreno, J.; Nieto, J. C.; Alsinet, C.; Enard, D.; Heyn, H.\nScore: 41.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.559946\nThe human immune system is under constant evolutionary pressure, primarily through its role as first line of defence against pathogens. Accordingly, population genomics studies have shown that immune-related genes have a high rate of adaptive evolution. These studies, however, are mainly based on protein-coding genes without cellular context, leaving the adaptive role of cell types and states uncharted. Inferring the rate of protein-coding genes adaptation in developing and adult immune cells at cellular resolution, we found cell types from both the lymphoid and myeloid compartments to harbour significantly increased adaptation rates. Specific cell states, such as foetal Pre-Pro B cells and adult T resident memory CD8+ cells show highly elevated rates of adaptation. We further analysed activated cell states, specifically, iPSC-derived macrophages responding to various challenges, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or bacterial and viral infections, the latter simulating the evolutionary arms race between humans and pathogens. Here, we found positive selection to be concentrated in early immune responses, suggesting benefits for the host to adapt to early stages of infection to control pathogen numbers and spread. Together, our study reveals spatio-temporal and functional biases in human immune populations with evidence of rapid adaptive evolution and provides a retrospect of forces that shaped the complexity, architecture, and function of the human body.\nHuman intestinal organoids with an autologoustissue-resident immune compartment\nAuthors: Recaldin, T.; Gjeta, B.; Steinacher, L.; Harter, M. F.; Adam, L.; Nikolaev, M.; Krese, R.; Kilik, U.; Popovic, D.; Almato-Bellavista, M.; Kromer, K.; Bscheider, M.; Cabon, L.; Camp, J. G.; Gjorevski, N.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560810\nThe intimate relationship between the epithelium and the immune system is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, with perturbations in epithelial-immune interactions linked to autoimmune disease and cancer. Whereas stem cell-derived organoids are powerful models of tissue-specific epithelial function, these structures lack tissue-resident immune cells that are essential for capturing organ-level processes. We describe human intestinal immuno-organoids (IIOs), formed through self-organization of epithelial organoids and autologous tissueresident lymphocytes (TRMs), a portion of which integrate within the IIO epithelium and survey the barrier. IIO formation was driven by TRM migration and interaction with epithelial cells, as orchestrated by TRM- enriched transcriptomic programs governing cell motility and epithelial inspection. We combined IIOs and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intestinal inflammation triggered by cancer-targeting biologics in patients, and found that the system recapitulates clinical outcomes and the underlying cellular mechanisms. Inflammation was associated with the emergence of an activated population of CD8+ T cells, which progressively acquired intraepithelial and cytotoxic features. The appearance of this effector population was preceded and likely mediated by a Th1- like CD4+ population, which initially displayed a cytokine producing character and subsequently became cytotoxic itself. A system amenable to direct perturbation and interrogation, IIOs allowed us to identify the Rho pathway as a novel target for mitigating immunotherapy-associated intestinal inflammation. Given that they recapitulate both the phenotypic outcomes and the underlying inter-lineage immune interactions, IIOs can be used to broadly study tissue-resident immune responses in the context of tumorigenesis, infectious and autoimmune diseases.\nmRNA vaccines encoding membrane-anchored receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 mutants induce strong humoral responses and can overcome immune imprinting\nAuthors: Al-Wassiti, H.

W.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560777\nTo address the limitations of whole-spike COVID vaccines, we explored mRNA vaccines encoding membrane-anchored receptor-binding domain (RBD-TMs), each a fusion of a variant RBD, the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In naive mice, RBD-TM mRNA vaccines against ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, Delta-plus, Kappa, Omicron BA.1 or BA.5, all induced strong humoral responses against the target RBD. Multiplex surrogate viral neutralization (sVNT) assays indicated broad neutralizing activity against a range of variant RBDs. In the setting of a heterologous boost, against the background of exposure to ancestral whole spike vaccines, sVNT studies suggested that RBD-TM vaccines were able to overcome the detrimental effects of immune imprinting. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 RBD-TM booster vaccines induced serum antibodies with 12 and 22-fold higher neutralizing activity against the target RBD than their equivalent whole spike variants. Boosting with BA.1 or BA.5 RBD-TM provided good protection against more recent variants including XBB and XBB.1.5. Each RBD-TM mRNA is 28% of the length of its whole-spike equivalent. This advantage will enable tetravalent mRNA vaccines to be developed at well-tolerated doses of formulated mRNA.

While a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood studies, with few focusing on samples derived from post-COVID affected tissues. Further, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal relationships. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to truly understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we have made comprehensive comparisons between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data derived from clinical PASC samples and relevant PASC mouse models. This revealed a strong pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC (R-PASC) in both humans and mice, and abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells. IFN-{gamma} emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in R-PASC. Strikingly, neutralizing IFN-{gamma} post the resolution of acute infection reduced lung inflammation, tissue fibrosis, and improved pulmonary gas-exchange function in two mouse models of R-PASC. Our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the root cause of PASC for developing effective therapies.\nMultimodal single-cell profiling of T cell specificity and reactivity in lung cancer\nAuthors: Bieberich, F.; Vazquez-Lombardi, R.; Jin, H.; Hong, K.-L.; Herzig, P.; Trefny, M.; Trueb, M.; Laubli, H.; Lardinois, D.; Mertz, K.; Matter, M.; Zippelius, A.; Reddy, S. T.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560863\nAdoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte T cells (TILs) offers one of the most promising approaches for cancer immunotherapy. However, high variability in patient responses highlight the need for an enhanced understanding of the transcriptional phenotypes of TILs and reactivity of their T cell receptors (TCR). Here, we employ single-cell multiomics approaches and TCR functional screening to investigate TILs from treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer patients. This comprehensive analysis integrates scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq, and scATAC-seq, enabling a high-resolution examination of TILs within lung cancer tissue, as well as the adjacent non-tumor tissue. We apply a cellular functional screening platform to identify reactive TCRs that represent \u003e1,000 TILs and have specificity towards a multitude of targets, including primary tumor cells, neoantigens, tumor-associated antigens, and viral antigens. Tumor-reactive TILs were primarily associated with dysfunctional phenotypes, whereas viral antigen-reactive TCRs were found in effector phenotype clusters. Key marker genes were identified and used to construct a tumor or viral reactivity score. Comparing clones shared in tumor and non-tumor tissue, a higher fraction of exhausted cells was observed in the tumor tissue, whereas non-tumor adjacent tissue possessed more effector cells, thus providing insight into potential sources for therapeutic T cells. Elucidating the specific T cell populations within TILs and their associated TCRs may support strategies to enhance the efficacy of TIL-based therapies.\nType I IFN signaling in the absence of IRGM1 promotes M. tuberculosis replication in immune cells by suppressing T cell responses\nAuthors: Naik, S. K.; McNehlan, M. E.; Mreyoud, Y.; Kinsella, R. L.; Smirnov, A.; Chowdhury, C. S.; McKee, S. R.; Dubey, N.; Woodson, R.; Kreamalmeyer, D.; Stallings, C. L.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560720\nPolymorphisms in the IRGM gene are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans. A murine ortholog of Irgm, Irgm1, is also essential for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in mice. Multiple processes have been associated with IRGM1 activity that could impact the host response to Mtb infection, including roles in autophagy-mediated pathogen clearance and expansion of activated T cells. However, what IRGM1-mediated pathway is necessary to control Mtb infection in vivo and the mechanistic basis for this control remains unknown. We dissected the contribution of IRGM1 to immune control of Mtb pathogenesis in vivo and found that Irgm1 deletion leads to higher levels of IRGM3-dependent type I interferon signaling. The increased type I interferon signaling precludes T cell expansion during Mtb infection. The absence of Mtb-specific T cell expansion in Irgm1-/- mice results in uncontrolled Mtb infection in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, which directly contributes to susceptibility to infection. Together, our studies reveal that IRGM1 is required to promote T cell-mediated control of Mtb infection in neutrophils, which is essential for the survival of Mtb-infected mice. These studies also uncover new ways type I interferon signaling can impact TH1 immune responses.\nGenetic ablation of adhesion ligands averts rejection of allogeneic immune cells\nAuthors: Hammer, Q.; Perica, K.; van Ooijen, H.; Mbofung, R.; Momayyezi, P.; Varady, E.; Martin, K. E.; Pan, Y.; Jelcic, M.; Groff, B.; Abujarour, R.; Krokeide, S.; Lee, T.; Williams, A.; Goodridge, J. P.; Valamehr, B.; Onfelt, B.; Sadelain, M.; Malmberg, K.-J.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.557143\nAllogeneic cell therapies hold promise for broad clinical implementation, but face limitations due to potential rejection by the recipient immune system. Silencing of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression is commonly employed to evade T cell-mediated rejection, although absence of B2M triggers missing-self responses by recipient natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the adhesion ligands CD54 and CD58 on targets cells robustly dampens NK cell reactivity across all sub-populations. Genetic deletion of CD54 and CD58 in B2M-deficient allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and multi-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cells reduces their susceptibility to rejection by NK cells in vitro and in vivo without affecting their anti-tumor effector potential. Thus, these data suggest that genetic ablation of adhesion ligands effectively alleviates rejection of allogeneic immune cells for immunotherapy.\nProximal protein landscapes of the type I interferon signaling cascade reveal negative regulation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PJA2\nAuthors: Schiefer, S.; Hale, B. G.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560926\nDeciphering the intricate dynamic events governing type I interferon (IFN) signaling is critical to unravel key regulatory mechanisms in host antiviral defense. Here, we leveraged TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with affinity purification-mass spectrometry to comprehensively map the proximal proteomes of all seven canonical human type I IFN signaling cascade members under basal and IFN-stimulated conditions. This established a network of 103 proteins in close proximity to the core members IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. We validated several known constitutive protein assemblies, while also revealing novel stimulus-dependent and -independent associations between key signaling molecules. Functional screening further identified PJA2 as a negative regulator of IFN signaling via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mechanistically, PJA2 interacts with the Janus kinases, TYK2 and JAK1, and promotes their non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination, resulting in restrained downstream STAT signaling. Our high-resolution proximal protein landscapes provide global insights into the type I IFN signaling network, and serve as a valuable resource for future exploration of its functional complexities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) are chronic diseases with poorly understood pathophysiology and diagnosis based on clinical assessment of unspecific symptoms. The recent post-COVID-19 condition, which shares similarities with ME/CFS and FM, has raised concerns about viral-induced transcriptome changes in post-viral syndromes. Viral infections, and other types of stress, are known to unleash human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) repression that if maintained could lead to symptom chronicity. This study evaluated this possibility for ME/CFS and FM on a selected cohort of female patients complying with diagnosis criteria for ME/CFS, FM, or both, and matched healthy controls (n=43). The results show specific HERV fingerprints for each disease, confirming biological differences between ME/CFS and FM. Unexpectedly, HERV profiles segregated patients that met both ME/CFS and FM clinical criteria from patients complying only with ME or FM criteria, while clearly differentiating patients from healthy subjects, supporting that the highly prevalent comorbidity condition must constitute a different nosological entity. Moreover, HERV profiles exposed significant quantitative differences within the ME/CFS group that correlated with differences in immune gene expression and patient symptomatology, supporting ME/CFS patient subtyping and confirming immunological disturbances in this disease. Pending issues include validation of HERV profiles as disease biomarkers of post-viral syndromes and understanding the role of HERV during infection and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human immune system is under constant evolutionary pressure, primarily through its role as first line of defence against pathogens. Accordingly, population genomics studies have shown that immune-related genes have a high rate of adaptive evolution. These studies, however, are mainly based on protein-coding genes without cellular context, leaving the adaptive role of cell types and states uncharted. Inferring the rate of protein-coding genes adaptation in developing and adult immune cells at cellular resolution, we found cell types from both the lymphoid and myeloid compartments to harbour significantly increased adaptation rates. Specific cell states, such as foetal Pre-Pro B cells and adult T resident memory CD8&#43; cells show highly elevated rates of adaptation. We further analysed activated cell states, specifically, iPSC-derived macrophages responding to various challenges, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or bacterial and viral infections, the latter simulating the evolutionary arms race between humans and pathogens. Here, we found positive selection to be concentrated in early immune responses, suggesting benefits for the host to adapt to early stages of infection to control pathogen numbers and spread. Together, our study reveals spatio-temporal and functional biases in human immune populations with evidence of rapid adaptive evolution and provides a retrospect of forces that shaped the complexity, architecture, and function of the human body.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intimate relationship between the epithelium and the immune system is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, with perturbations in epithelial-immune interactions linked to autoimmune disease and cancer. Whereas stem cell-derived organoids are powerful models of tissue-specific epithelial function, these structures lack tissue-resident immune cells that are essential for capturing organ-level processes. We describe human intestinal immuno-organoids (IIOs), formed through self-organization of epithelial organoids and autologous tissueresident lymphocytes (TRMs), a portion of which integrate within the IIO epithelium and survey the barrier. IIO formation was driven by TRM migration and interaction with epithelial cells, as orchestrated by TRM- enriched transcriptomic programs governing cell motility and epithelial inspection. We combined IIOs and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intestinal inflammation triggered by cancer-targeting biologics in patients, and found that the system recapitulates clinical outcomes and the underlying cellular mechanisms. Inflammation was associated with the emergence of an activated population of CD8&#43; T cells, which progressively acquired intraepithelial and cytotoxic features. The appearance of this effector population was preceded and likely mediated by a Th1- like CD4&#43; population, which initially displayed a cytokine producing character and subsequently became cytotoxic itself. A system amenable to direct perturbation and interrogation, IIOs allowed us to identify the Rho pathway as a novel target for mitigating immunotherapy-associated intestinal inflammation. Given that they recapitulate both the phenotypic outcomes and the underlying inter-lineage immune interactions, IIOs can be used to broadly study tissue-resident immune responses in the context of tumorigenesis, infectious and autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To address the limitations of whole-spike COVID vaccines, we explored mRNA vaccines encoding membrane-anchored receptor-binding domain (RBD-TMs), each a fusion of a variant RBD, the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In naive mice, RBD-TM mRNA vaccines against ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, Delta-plus, Kappa, Omicron BA.1 or BA.5, all induced strong humoral responses against the target RBD. Multiplex surrogate viral neutralization (sVNT) assays indicated broad neutralizing activity against a range of variant RBDs. In the setting of a heterologous boost, against the background of exposure to ancestral whole spike vaccines, sVNT studies suggested that RBD-TM vaccines were able to overcome the detrimental effects of immune imprinting. Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 RBD-TM booster vaccines induced serum antibodies with 12 and 22-fold higher neutralizing activity against the target RBD than their equivalent whole spike variants. Boosting with BA.1 or BA.5 RBD-TM provided good protection against more recent variants including XBB and XBB.1.5. Each RBD-TM mRNA is 28% of the length of its whole-spike equivalent. This advantage will enable tetravalent mRNA vaccines to be developed at well-tolerated doses of formulated mRNA.

        <p class="abstract">Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) represents an urgent public health challenge, with its impact resonating in over 60 million individuals globally. While a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood studies, with few focusing on samples derived from post-COVID affected tissues. Further, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal relationships. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to truly understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we have made comprehensive comparisons between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data derived from clinical PASC samples and relevant PASC mouse models. This revealed a strong pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC (R-PASC) in both humans and mice, and abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells. IFN-{gamma} emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in R-PASC. Strikingly, neutralizing IFN-{gamma} post the resolution of acute infection reduced lung inflammation, tissue fibrosis, and improved pulmonary gas-exchange function in two mouse models of R-PASC. Our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the root cause of PASC for developing effective therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte T cells (TILs) offers one of the most promising approaches for cancer immunotherapy. However, high variability in patient responses highlight the need for an enhanced understanding of the transcriptional phenotypes of TILs and reactivity of their T cell receptors (TCR). Here, we employ single-cell multiomics approaches and TCR functional screening to investigate TILs from treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer patients. This comprehensive analysis integrates scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq, and scATAC-seq, enabling a high-resolution examination of TILs within lung cancer tissue, as well as the adjacent non-tumor tissue. We apply a cellular functional screening platform to identify reactive TCRs that represent &gt;1,000 TILs and have specificity towards a multitude of targets, including primary tumor cells, neoantigens, tumor-associated antigens, and viral antigens. Tumor-reactive TILs were primarily associated with dysfunctional phenotypes, whereas viral antigen-reactive TCRs were found in effector phenotype clusters. Key marker genes were identified and used to construct a tumor or viral reactivity score. Comparing clones shared in tumor and non-tumor tissue, a higher fraction of exhausted cells was observed in the tumor tissue, whereas non-tumor adjacent tissue possessed more effector cells, thus providing insight into potential sources for therapeutic T cells. Elucidating the specific T cell populations within TILs and their associated TCRs may support strategies to enhance the efficacy of TIL-based therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polymorphisms in the IRGM gene are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans. A murine ortholog of Irgm, Irgm1, is also essential for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in mice. Multiple processes have been associated with IRGM1 activity that could impact the host response to Mtb infection, including roles in autophagy-mediated pathogen clearance and expansion of activated T cells. However, what IRGM1-mediated pathway is necessary to control Mtb infection in vivo and the mechanistic basis for this control remains unknown. We dissected the contribution of IRGM1 to immune control of Mtb pathogenesis in vivo and found that Irgm1 deletion leads to higher levels of IRGM3-dependent type I interferon signaling. The increased type I interferon signaling precludes T cell expansion during Mtb infection. The absence of Mtb-specific T cell expansion in Irgm1-/- mice results in uncontrolled Mtb infection in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, which directly contributes to susceptibility to infection. Together, our studies reveal that IRGM1 is required to promote T cell-mediated control of Mtb infection in neutrophils, which is essential for the survival of Mtb-infected mice. These studies also uncover new ways type I interferon signaling can impact TH1 immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Allogeneic cell therapies hold promise for broad clinical implementation, but face limitations due to potential rejection by the recipient immune system. Silencing of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression is commonly employed to evade T cell-mediated rejection, although absence of B2M triggers missing-self responses by recipient natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the adhesion ligands CD54 and CD58 on targets cells robustly dampens NK cell reactivity across all sub-populations. Genetic deletion of CD54 and CD58 in B2M-deficient allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and multi-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cells reduces their susceptibility to rejection by NK cells in vitro and in vivo without affecting their anti-tumor effector potential. Thus, these data suggest that genetic ablation of adhesion ligands effectively alleviates rejection of allogeneic immune cells for immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deciphering the intricate dynamic events governing type I interferon (IFN) signaling is critical to unravel key regulatory mechanisms in host antiviral defense. Here, we leveraged TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with affinity purification-mass spectrometry to comprehensively map the proximal proteomes of all seven canonical human type I IFN signaling cascade members under basal and IFN-stimulated conditions. This established a network of 103 proteins in close proximity to the core members IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. We validated several known constitutive protein assemblies, while also revealing novel stimulus-dependent and -independent associations between key signaling molecules. Functional screening further identified PJA2 as a negative regulator of IFN signaling via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mechanistically, PJA2 interacts with the Janus kinases, TYK2 and JAK1, and promotes their non-lysine and non-degradative ubiquitination, resulting in restrained downstream STAT signaling. Our high-resolution proximal protein landscapes provide global insights into the type I IFN signaling network, and serve as a valuable resource for future exploration of its functional complexities.</p>
