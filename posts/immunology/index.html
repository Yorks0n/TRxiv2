D.\nScore: 38.0, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.545921\nRespiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can activate an exaggerated inflammatory response (cytokine storm) in the lungs that may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hospitalization, and death. Therapies that target a specific pathogen (i.e. anti-virals) must, by nature, be selected after a specific diagnosis and may become ineffective due to pathogen evolution. An alternate strategy is to counter the exaggerated innate immune response present in ARDS patients using host-directed drug therapies that are agnostic to the infectious agent to overcome both of these challenges. Originally described as the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is now understood to be an important mediator of inflammation caused by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Here we show that paridiprubart, a monoclonal antibody that prevents TLR4 dimer formation, inhibits the response to TLR4 agonists including LPS, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the DAMP high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the NF-{kappa}B response to infection by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Notable in this regard, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 increases HMGB1 levels, and that paridiprubart inhibits both the SARS-CoV-2 and HMGB1-triggered NF-{kappa}B response, illustrating its potential to suppress this self-amplifying inflammatory signal. We also observed that the inhibitory effect of paridiprubart is apparent when cells are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is itself a direct TLR4 agonist. In the context of active infection, paridiprubart suppressed the NF-{kappa}B-dependent response elicited by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the seasonal coronavirus 229E, influenza A virus or Haemophilus influenzae, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen. Combined, these findings reinforce the central role played by TLR4 in the inflammatory response to infection by diverse pathogens, and demonstrates the protective potential of paridiprubart-dependent inhibition of pathogenic TLR4 responses.\nInfection-induced vascular inflammation in COVID-19 links focal microglial dysfunction with neuropathologies through IL-1/IL-6-related systemic inflammatory states\nAuthors: Fekete, R.; Simats, A.; Biro, E.; Cserep, C.; Schwarcz, A. D.; Posfai, B.; Szabadits, E.; Kornyei, Z.; Toth, K.; Kellermayer, A.; David, C.; Acsady, L.; Kontra, L.; Silvestre-Roig, C.; Moldvay, J.; Fillinger, J.; Hortobagyi, T.; Liesz, A.; Benko, S.; Denes, A.\nScore: 24.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546214\nCOVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.\nVibrio cholerae Arrests Intestinal Epithelial Proliferation through T6SS-dependent Activation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Pathway.\nAuthors: Xu, X.; Foley, E.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547108\nTo maintain an effective barrier, intestinal epithelial progenitor cells must divide at a rate that matches the loss of dead and dying cells. Otherwise, epithelial breaches expose the host to systemic infection by gut-resident microbes. Unlike most pathogens, Vibrio cholerae blocks tissue repair by arresting progenitor proliferation in the Drosophila infection model. At present, we do not understand how Vibrio circumvents such a critical antibacterial defense. In a series of genetic experiments, we found that V. cholerae blocks epithelial repair by activating the growth inhibitor Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway in progenitors. Specifically, we discovered that interactions between Vibrio and gut commensals initiate BMP signaling via host innate immune defenses. Notably, we found that Vibrio also activates BMP and arrests proliferation in zebrafish intestines, indicating an evolutionarily conserved link between infection, BMP and failure in tissue repair. Combined, our study highlights how enteric pathogens engage host immune and growth regulatory pathways to disrupt intestinal epithelial repair.\nInterferons are the key cytokines acting on pancreatic islets in type 1 diabetes\nAuthors: Coomans de Brachene, A.; Alvelos, M. I.; Szymczak, F.; Zimath, P. L.; Castela, A.; Marmontel de Souza, B.; Roca Rivada, A.; Marin-Canas, S.; Yi, X.; Op de Beeck, A.; Morgan, N. G.; Sonntag, S.; Jawurek, S.; Title, A. C.; Yesildag, B.; Pattou, F.; Kerr-Conte, J.; Montanya, E.; Nacher, M.; Marselli, L.; Marchetti, P.; Richardson, S. J.; Eizirik, D. L.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547000\nThe pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to danger signals such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.\np97/VCP targets Toxoplasma gondii vacuoles for parasite restriction in interferon-stimulated human cells\nAuthors: Clough, B.; Fisch, D.; Mize, T. H.; Encheva, V.; Snijders, A.; Frickel, E.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545566\nInfection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to production of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) that stimulates cells to upregulate defence proteins targeting the parasite for cell intrinsic elimination or growth restriction. Various host defence mechanisms operate at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in different human cell types leading to PV disruption, acidification, or membrane envelopment. Ubiquitin and p62 are players in all human host control mechanisms of Toxoplasma, but other unifying proteins have not been identified. Here, we show that p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), as well as its associated proteins ANKRD13A and UBXD1 control Toxoplasma infection while recruited to the PV in IFN{gamma}-stimulated endothelial cells. Convergent deposition of ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 onto the same vacuole is dependent on vacuolar ubiquitination and observed within 2h post-infection. ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 all drive the acidification mechanism of the vacuole, which is the IFN{gamma}-dependent control pathway of Toxoplasma in endothelial cells. We assessed p97/VCP in Toxoplasma control in various human cells and demonstrate that p97/VCP is a universal IFN{gamma}-dependent host restriction factor targeting the Toxoplasma PV in epithelial (HeLa) and endothelial cells (HUVEC), fibroblasts (HFF) and macrophages (THP1).\nScalable in-vitro immunostimulation of human blood for in-depth profiling of acute immune response effects\nAuthors: Reitzner, S. M.; Mikes, J.; Brodin, P.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-06-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.544193\nIn-vitro immune stimulation of whole blood has great analytic potential for exploring the immune system function. However, logistical and biological constraints might limit the extent to which such investigations can be performed. Flexible and often even low-tech mobile applicability can increase the diversity of conditions that can be investigated. To this end, we developed and optimized a medium that enables prolonged in-vitro stimulation and enables highly functional immune responses within 24 hours of incubation. In addition, we also developed and optimized a low-tech water-based mobile incubator to enable logistical flexibility. Finally, we describe the implementation of both systems using a practical example of sample collection at a sampling site with no access to laboratory equipment outside of a research lab.\nMacrophages sense ECM mechanics and growth factor availability through cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate their tissue repair program\nAuthors: Meizlish, M. L.; Kimura, Y.; Pope, S. D.; Matta, R.; Kim, C.; Philip, N.; Meyaard, L.; Gonzalez, A.; Medzhitov, R.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.545586\nTissue resident macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair. How macrophages monitor and maintain tissue integrity is not well understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key structural and organizational component of tissues. Here, we find that macrophages sense the mechanical properties of the ECM in order to regulate a specific tissue repair program. We show that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskeletal remodeling and can be performed in three-dimensional environments through a non-canonical, integrin-independent mechanism analogous to amoeboid migration. We find that these cytoskeletal dynamics also integrate biochemical signaling by CSF1, ultimately regulating chromatin accessibility to control the mechanosensitive gene expression program. This study suggests a distinct mode of ECM mechanosensing and growth factor signaling through which macrophages may regulate tissue repair and fibrosis.\nMapping SARS-CoV-2 antigenic relationships and serological responses\nAuthors: Wilks, S.

Here, we use antigenic cartography to analyze patterns of cross-reactivity among a panel of 21 variants and 15 groups of human sera obtained following primary infection with 10 different variants or after mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 vaccination. We find antigenic differences among pre-Omicron variants caused by substitutions at spike protein positions 417, 452, 484, and 501. Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and \u003e3 months post-2nd dose. We find changes in immunodominance of different spike regions depending on the variant an individual was first exposed to, with implications for variant risk assessment and vaccine strain selection. One sentence summaryAntigenic Cartography of SARS-CoV-2 variants reveals amino acid substitutions governing immune escape and immunodominance patterns.\nThe Antitumor Activities of Anti-CD47 Antibodies Require Fc-FcγR interactions\nAuthors: Osorio, J. C.; Smith, P.; Knorr, D. A.; Ravetch, J.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547082\nWhile anti-CD47 antibodies hold promise for cancer immunotherapy, early phase clinical trials have shown limited signs of clinical benefit, suggesting that blockade of CD47 alone may not be sufficient for effective tumor control. Here, we investigate the contributions of the Fc domain of anti-CD47 antibodies required for optimal in vivo antitumor activity across multiple species-matched models, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this emerging class of therapeutic antibodies. Using a novel mouse model humanized for CD47, SIRP and Fc{gamma}Rs, we demonstrate that local administration of an Fc-engineered anti-CD47 antibody with enhanced binding to activating Fc{gamma}/Rs modulates myeloid and T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in improved long-term systemic antitumor immunity and minimal on-target off-tumor toxicity. Our results highlight the importance of Fc optimization in the development of effective anti-CD47 therapies and provide a novel approach for enhancing the antitumor activity of this promising immunotherapy.\nHuman Th17- and IgG3-associated autoimmunity induced by a translocating gut pathobiont\nAuthors: Gronke, K.; Nguyen, M.; Santamaria de Souza, N.; Schumacher, J.; Yang, Y.; Sonnert, N.

W.; Bieniossek, C.; Kriegel, M. A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.546430\nExtraintestinal autoimmune diseases are multifactorial with translocating gut pathobionts implicated as instigators and perpetuators in mice. However, the microbial contributions to autoimmunity in humans remain largely unclear, including whether specific pathological human adaptive immune responses are triggered by such pathobionts. We show here that the translocating pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum induces human IFN+ Th17 differentiation and IgG3 subclass switch of anti-E. gallinarum RNA and correlating anti-human RNA autoantibody responses in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis. Human Th17 induction by E. gallinarum is cell-contact dependent and involves TLR8-mediated human monocyte activation. In murine gnotobiotic lupus models, E. gallinarum translocation triggers IgG3 anti-RNA autoantibody titers that correlate with renal autoimmune pathophysiology and with disease activity in patients. Overall, we define cellular mechanisms of how a translocating pathobiont induces human T- and B-cell-dependent autoimmune responses, providing a framework for developing host- and microbiota-derived biomarkers and targeted therapies in extraintestinal autoimmune diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can activate an exaggerated inflammatory response (cytokine storm) in the lungs that may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hospitalization, and death. Therapies that target a specific pathogen (i.e. anti-virals) must, by nature, be selected after a specific diagnosis and may become ineffective due to pathogen evolution. An alternate strategy is to counter the exaggerated innate immune response present in ARDS patients using host-directed drug therapies that are agnostic to the infectious agent to overcome both of these challenges. Originally described as the innate immune receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is now understood to be an important mediator of inflammation caused by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Here we show that paridiprubart, a monoclonal antibody that prevents TLR4 dimer formation, inhibits the response to TLR4 agonists including LPS, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the DAMP high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as well as the NF-{kappa}B response to infection by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Notable in this regard, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 increases HMGB1 levels, and that paridiprubart inhibits both the SARS-CoV-2 and HMGB1-triggered NF-{kappa}B response, illustrating its potential to suppress this self-amplifying inflammatory signal. We also observed that the inhibitory effect of paridiprubart is apparent when cells are exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is itself a direct TLR4 agonist. In the context of active infection, paridiprubart suppressed the NF-{kappa}B-dependent response elicited by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the seasonal coronavirus 229E, influenza A virus or Haemophilus influenzae, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen. Combined, these findings reinforce the central role played by TLR4 in the inflammatory response to infection by diverse pathogens, and demonstrates the protective potential of paridiprubart-dependent inhibition of pathogenic TLR4 responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To maintain an effective barrier, intestinal epithelial progenitor cells must divide at a rate that matches the loss of dead and dying cells. Otherwise, epithelial breaches expose the host to systemic infection by gut-resident microbes. Unlike most pathogens, Vibrio cholerae blocks tissue repair by arresting progenitor proliferation in the Drosophila infection model. At present, we do not understand how Vibrio circumvents such a critical antibacterial defense. In a series of genetic experiments, we found that V. cholerae blocks epithelial repair by activating the growth inhibitor Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway in progenitors. Specifically, we discovered that interactions between Vibrio and gut commensals initiate BMP signaling via host innate immune defenses. Notably, we found that Vibrio also activates BMP and arrests proliferation in zebrafish intestines, indicating an evolutionarily conserved link between infection, BMP and failure in tissue repair. Combined, our study highlights how enteric pathogens engage host immune and growth regulatory pathways to disrupt intestinal epithelial repair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to danger signals such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to production of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) that stimulates cells to upregulate defence proteins targeting the parasite for cell intrinsic elimination or growth restriction. Various host defence mechanisms operate at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in different human cell types leading to PV disruption, acidification, or membrane envelopment. Ubiquitin and p62 are players in all human host control mechanisms of Toxoplasma, but other unifying proteins have not been identified. Here, we show that p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), as well as its associated proteins ANKRD13A and UBXD1 control Toxoplasma infection while recruited to the PV in IFN{gamma}-stimulated endothelial cells. Convergent deposition of ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 onto the same vacuole is dependent on vacuolar ubiquitination and observed within 2h post-infection. ANKRD13A, p97/VCP and UBXD1 all drive the acidification mechanism of the vacuole, which is the IFN{gamma}-dependent control pathway of Toxoplasma in endothelial cells. We assessed p97/VCP in Toxoplasma control in various human cells and demonstrate that p97/VCP is a universal IFN{gamma}-dependent host restriction factor targeting the Toxoplasma PV in epithelial (HeLa) and endothelial cells (HUVEC), fibroblasts (HFF) and macrophages (THP1).</p>

        <p class="abstract">In-vitro immune stimulation of whole blood has great analytic potential for exploring the immune system function. However, logistical and biological constraints might limit the extent to which such investigations can be performed. Flexible and often even low-tech mobile applicability can increase the diversity of conditions that can be investigated. To this end, we developed and optimized a medium that enables prolonged in-vitro stimulation and enables highly functional immune responses within 24 hours of incubation. In addition, we also developed and optimized a low-tech water-based mobile incubator to enable logistical flexibility. Finally, we describe the implementation of both systems using a practical example of sample collection at a sampling site with no access to laboratory equipment outside of a research lab.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue resident macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair. How macrophages monitor and maintain tissue integrity is not well understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key structural and organizational component of tissues. Here, we find that macrophages sense the mechanical properties of the ECM in order to regulate a specific tissue repair program. We show that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskeletal remodeling and can be performed in three-dimensional environments through a non-canonical, integrin-independent mechanism analogous to amoeboid migration. We find that these cytoskeletal dynamics also integrate biochemical signaling by CSF1, ultimately regulating chromatin accessibility to control the mechanosensitive gene expression program. This study suggests a distinct mode of ECM mechanosensing and growth factor signaling through which macrophages may regulate tissue repair and fibrosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple variants escaping pre-existing immunity emerged, causing concerns about continued protection. Here, we use antigenic cartography to analyze patterns of cross-reactivity among a panel of 21 variants and 15 groups of human sera obtained following primary infection with 10 different variants or after mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351 vaccination. We find antigenic differences among pre-Omicron variants caused by substitutions at spike protein positions 417, 452, 484, and 501. Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and &gt;3 months post-2nd dose. We find changes in immunodominance of different spike regions depending on the variant an individual was first exposed to, with implications for variant risk assessment and vaccine strain selection.

        <p class="abstract">While anti-CD47 antibodies hold promise for cancer immunotherapy, early phase clinical trials have shown limited signs of clinical benefit, suggesting that blockade of CD47 alone may not be sufficient for effective tumor control. Here, we investigate the contributions of the Fc domain of anti-CD47 antibodies required for optimal in vivo antitumor activity across multiple species-matched models, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this emerging class of therapeutic antibodies. Using a novel mouse model humanized for CD47, SIRP and Fc{gamma}Rs, we demonstrate that local administration of an Fc-engineered anti-CD47 antibody with enhanced binding to activating Fc{gamma}/Rs modulates myeloid and T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in improved long-term systemic antitumor immunity and minimal on-target off-tumor toxicity. Our results highlight the importance of Fc optimization in the development of effective anti-CD47 therapies and provide a novel approach for enhancing the antitumor activity of this promising immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extraintestinal autoimmune diseases are multifactorial with translocating gut pathobionts implicated as instigators and perpetuators in mice. However, the microbial contributions to autoimmunity in humans remain largely unclear, including whether specific pathological human adaptive immune responses are triggered by such pathobionts. We show here that the translocating pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum induces human IFN&#43; Th17 differentiation and IgG3 subclass switch of anti-E. gallinarum RNA and correlating anti-human RNA autoantibody responses in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis. Human Th17 induction by E. gallinarum is cell-contact dependent and involves TLR8-mediated human monocyte activation. In murine gnotobiotic lupus models, E. gallinarum translocation triggers IgG3 anti-RNA autoantibody titers that correlate with renal autoimmune pathophysiology and with disease activity in patients. Overall, we define cellular mechanisms of how a translocating pathobiont induces human T- and B-cell-dependent autoimmune responses, providing a framework for developing host- and microbiota-derived biomarkers and targeted therapies in extraintestinal autoimmune diseases.</p>
