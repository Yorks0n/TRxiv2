However, its pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to other endemic viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon for dengue viruses. Given the recent surge in dengue cases and potential cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, this study explores the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DENV-2 infection. The study assessed the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the DENV-2 Virus. Human convalescent plasma samples collected during different waves of COVID-19 and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 were examined for their potential to cause ADE of DENV-2 infection using cell-based assays. The study found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies acquired from natural infection in humans or through experimental immunization in animals were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and had the potential to enhance DENV-2 infection in K562 and U937 cells. In-silico and in-vitro studies indicated a strong interaction between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV-2 E-protein, providing a molecular basis for these findings. This study is the first to demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cross-react with DENV-2 and can enhance its infection through ADE. These findings have implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and deployment strategies in regions where dengue is endemic. SummaryAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (RBD and Spike) showed significant cross reactivity with DENV-2 (E protein). Also, anti-SARS-CoV-2-commercial antibodies, immunised animal sera and 46 human convalescent plasma samples (from different waves of pandemic) demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV-2 infection.\nAn \"alert state\" ribosome population acts as a master regulator of cytokine mediated processes\nAuthors: Dopler, A.; Alkan, F.; Malka, Y.; Hoefakker, K.; Isaeva, O. I.; Kerkhoff, M.; Gangaev, A.; Silva, J.; Ramalho, S.; Hoekman, L.; Altelaar, M.; van der Kammen, R.; Yewdell, J. W.; Kvistborg, P.; Faller, W. J.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562425\nInflammatory cytokines are pivotal to immune responses. Upon cytokine exposure, cells enter an \"alert-state\" that enhances their visibility to the immune system. Here, we identified an \"alert-state\" subpopulation of ribosomes (ASRs) defined by the presence of the P-stalk. We show that ASRs are formed in response to cytokines linked to tumor immunity, and are involved in the preferential translation of mRNAs vital for the cytokine response. Mechanistically, ASRs are required for the efficient translation of transmembrane domains of receptor molecules involved in cytokine-mediated processes. Importantly, loss of the ASR prevents CD8+ T cell recognition and killing, and inhibitory cytokines like TGF{beta} hinder ASR formation, suggesting that the ASR is a central regulatory hub upon which multiple signals converge. Thus, the ASR is an essential mediator of the cellular rewiring that occurs following cytokine exposure, via the translational regulation of this process.\nDesign of universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates via immunofocusing\nAuthors: Xu, D.; Powell, A. E.; Utz, A.; Sanyal, M.; Do, J.; Patten, J. J.; Moliva, J. I.; Sullivan, N. J.; Davey, R. A.; Kim, P. S.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562364\nEbola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and poses a significant threat to global public health. Although two viral vector vaccines have been approved to prevent Ebola virus disease, they are distributed in the limited ring vaccination setting and only indicated for prevention of infection from orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) - one of three orthoebolavirus species that have caused previous outbreaks. Ebola virus glycoprotein GP mediates viral infection and serves as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe a universal Ebola virus vaccine approach using structure-guided design of candidates with hyperglycosylation that aims to direct antibody responses away from variable regions and toward conserved epitopes of GP. We first determined the hyperglycosylation landscape on Ebola virus GP and used that to generate hyperglycosylated GP variants with two to four additional glycosylation sites to mask the highly variable glycan cap region. We then created vaccine candidates by displaying wild-type or hyperglycosylated GP variants on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Immunization with these antigens elicited potent neutralizing antisera against EBOV in mice. Importantly, we observed consistent cross-neutralizing activity against Bundibugyo virus and Sudan virus from hyperglycosylated GP-Fer with two or three additional glycans. In comparison, elicitation of cross-neutralizing antisera was rare in mice immunized with wild-type GP-Fer. These results demonstrate a potential strategy to develop universal Ebola virus vaccines that confer cross-protective immunity against existing and emerging filovirus species. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEbola virus outbreaks cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. Current viral vaccines require cold-chain storage and are distributed in limited ring vaccination settings. They are only indicated for protection against orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV), one of three human-pathogenic Ebola virus species. Here we harness hyperglycosylation as an immunofocusing approach to design universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates based on Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) displayed on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Compared with wild-type GP-Fer, immunization with hyperglycosylated GP-Fer elicited potently neutralizing antisera against EBOV, and more importantly, consistent cross-neutralizing activity against the other two orthoebolavirus species. Our work shows that immunofocusing antibody responses toward conserved and neutralizing epitopes of GP represents a promising strategy for vaccine design against antigenically diverse Ebola virus species.\nAntigen-level resolution of commensal-specific B cell responses enabled by phage-display screening and B cell tetramers\nAuthors: Verma, S.; Dufort, M. J.; Olsen, T. M.; Labuda, J. C.; Kimmel, S.; Scharffenberger, S.; McGuire, A.; Harrison, O. J.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562275\nInduction of adaptive immune responses to commensal microbes is critical for tissue homeostasis, and perturbation of these responses is associated with multiple chronic inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and regulation of mucosal B cells targeting commensal microbes remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of tools to identify commensal-specific B cells ex vivo. To address this, we identified immunogenic protein epitopes recognized by Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB)-specific serum antibodies using a whole-genome phage display screen and identified immunogenic proteins engaging IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Using these antigens, we generated B cell tetramers to identify and track SFB-specific B cell responses in the gut associated lymphoid tissue during natural and de novo colonization. We revealed a compartmentalized response in SFB-specific B cell activation between Peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, with a gradient of IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes along the small intestine, and selective production of IgG2b with the mesenteric lymph node chain. VDJ sequencing analyses and generation of SFB-specific monoclonal antibodies identified that somatic hypermutation drives affinity maturation to SFB derived antigens under homeostatic conditions. By combining phage display screening and B cell tetramer technologies, we now enable antigen-level based studies of immunity to intestinal microbes, which will advance our understanding of the ontogeny and function of commensal-specific B cell responses in tissue immunity, inflammation and repair.\nGeneration of circulating autoreactive pre-plasma cells fueled by naive B cells in celiac disease\nAuthors: Lindeman, I.; Hoydahl, L. S.; Christophersen, A.; Risnes, L. F.; Jahnsen, J.; Lundin, K. E. A.; Sollid, L. M.; Iversen, R.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563227\nAutoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are characteristic of celiac disease (CeD), and TG2-specific IgA plasma cells are abundant in gut biopsies of patients. We here describe the corresponding population of autoreactive B cells in blood. Circulating TG2-specific IgA cells were found in untreated patients on a gluten-containing diet but not in controls. They were clonally related to TG2-specific small intestinal plasma cells, and they expressed gut-homing molecules, indicating that they are plasma cell precursors. Unlike other IgA-switched cells, the TG2-specific cells were negative for CD27, placing them in the double negative (IgD-CD27-) category. They had a plasmablast or activated memory B-cell phenotype, and they harbored fewer variable region mutations than other IgA cells. Based on their similarity to naive B cells, we propose that autoreactive IgA cells in CeD are generated mainly through chronic recruitment of naive B cells via an extrafollicular response involving gluten-specific CD4+ T cells.\nThe increased hinge flexibility of an IgG1-IgG3 hybrid monoclonal enhances Fc-mediated protection against group A streptococci\nAuthors: Izadi, A.; Karami, Y.; Bratanis, E.; Wrighton, S.; Khakzad, H.; Nyblom, M.; Olofsson, B.; Happonen, L.; Tang, D.; Nilges, M.; Malmström, J.; Bahnan, W.; Shannon, O.; Malmström, L.; Nordenfelt, P.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562368\nAntibodies are central to the immune response against microbes. We have previously generated a protective IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the M protein, a critical virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we generated this antibody in all human IgG subclasses and evaluated their function. Despite significantly reduced binding, the IgG3 subclass antibody demonstrated remarkably enhanced opsonic function. We hypothesized that increased Fc flexibility could explain this improved efficacy. We engineered a hybrid IgG subclass antibody, IgGh, containing the backbone of IgG1 with the hinge of IgG3, leaving the Fabs unchanged. The IgGh maintained a similar binding ability as IgG1 while gaining the strong opsonic function seen with IgG3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the different antibodies showed altered IgG Fab-antigen interactions, reflecting the differences observed in affinity. More importantly, when the antibodies were bound to the antigen, the simulations showed that the Fc of both IgGh and IgG3 exhibited extensive movement in 3D space relative to the M protein. The increased flexibility of IgGh directly translated to enhanced opsonic function and significantly increased the protection against infection with Streptococcus pyogenes in mice. Our findings demonstrate how altering Fc flexibility can improve Fc-mediated opsonic function and how modifications in the constant domain can regulate Fab-antigen interactions. In addition, the enhanced in vivo function of a more flexible IgG provides new therapeutic opportunities for monoclonal antibodies. One sentence summaryAntibody Fc flexibility in 3D space correlates with efficient Fc-mediated phagocytosis of streptococci\nScarring hair follicle destruction is driven by the collapse of EGFR-protected JAK-STAT1-sensitive stem cell immune privilege\nAuthors: Strobl, K.; Klufa, J.; Jin, R.; Artner-Gent, L.; Krauss, D.; Novoszel, P.; Strobl, J.; Stary, G.; Vujic, I.; Griss, J.; Holcmann, M.; Farlik, M.; Homey, B.; Sibilia, M.; Bauer, T.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561653\nThe hair follicle stem cell niche is an immune-privileged microenvironment, characterised by suppressed antigen presentation, thus shielding against permanent immune-mediated tissue damage. In this study, we demonstrate the protective role of hair follicle-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from scarring hair follicle degeneration. Mechanistically, disruption of EGFR signalling generates a cell intrinsic hypersensitivity within the JAK-STAT1 pathway, compromising the immune privilege in the context of CD8 T cell and NK cell-mediated inflammation. Genetic depletion of either JAK1/2 or STAT1 or topical therapeutic inhibition of JAK1/2 restores the immune privilege and activates stem cells to resume hair growth in mouse models of epidermal and hair follicle specific EGFR deletion. Skin biopsies from EGFR inhibitor-treated and from EGFR-independent cicatricial alopecia patients indicate active STAT1 signalling within the hair follicles. Notably, a case study of folliculitis decalvans, characterised by progressive hair loss, scaling and perifollicular erythema, demonstrates successful treatment with systemic JAK1/2 inhibition. Our findings offer mechanistic insights and present a therapeutic strategy for addressing scarring hair follicle destruction associated with EGFR-inhibitor therapy and cicatricial alopecia.\nALCAM-mediated synapses between DC1 and CD8 T cells are inhibited in advanced lung tumors\nAuthors: Morosi, L. G.; Piperno, G. M.; Joshi, S.; Amadio, R.; Vodret, S.; Lopez-Rodriguez, L.; Benvenuti, F.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562940\nConventional type 1 dendritic cells (DC1) control anti-tumoral CD8 T responses, in lymph nodes and tumor tissues. T-cell activation depends on the establishment of a tight physical interaction with antigen-presenting cell, the immunological synapse (IS). The molecular determinants of DC1-CD8 IS in tumor tissues and how they are regulated during cancer progression remain poorly investigated. Using a reporter for DC1 in a genetic model of non-small cell lung cancer (KP-XCR1venus) we show that IS in lung tissues are abundant and productive at early stages of tumor development but progressively diminish in advanced tumors. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry of lung resident DC1 identified a module of adhesion molecules downregulated in advanced tumors. We focused on ALCAM and LFA-1, ligands for CD6 and ICAM-1 on T cells, to investigate their role and functional impact. By immobilizing single receptor agonists on artificial cell surfaces, we demonstrate that ALCAM and LFA-1 are sufficient to trigger cytoskeletal remodeling in early tumor DC1, whereas late tumors DC1 are not responsive. Blocking ALCAM-CD6 interactions in functional assays impairs the acquisition of effector functions in CD8 T cells. Together these data highlight that adhesion molecules required to establish IS in early, immune-reactive, tumors are targeted during tumor progression blunting cross-talk within the IS.\nImmune landscape of tertiary lymphoid structures in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade\nAuthors: Shu, D. H.; Ho, W. J.; Kagohara, L. T.; Girgis, A.; Shin, S. M.; Danilova, L.; Lee, J. W.; Sidiropoulos, D. N.; Mitchell, S.; Munjal, K.; Howe, K.; Bendinelli, K.

L.; Ogurtsova, A.; Baretti, M.; Laheru, D.; Durham, J. N.; Wang, H.; Anders, R.; Jaffee, E. M.; Fertig, E. J.; Yarchoan, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562104\nNeoadjuvant immunotherapy is thought to produce long-term remissions through induction of antitumor immune responses before removal of the primary tumor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), germinal center-like structures that can arise within tumors, may contribute to the establishment of immunological memory in this setting, but understanding of their role remains limited. Here, we investigated the contribution of TLS to antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. We found that neoadjuvant immunotherapy induced the formation of TLS, which were associated with superior pathologic response, improved relapse free survival, and expansion of the intratumoral T and B cell repertoire. While TLS in viable tumor displayed a highly active mature morphology, in areas of tumor regression we identified an involuted TLS morphology, which was characterized by dispersion of the B cell follicle and persistence of a T cell zone enriched for ongoing antigen presentation and T cell-mature dendritic cell interactions. Involuted TLS showed increased expression of T cell memory markers and expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic and tissue resident memory clonotypes. Collectively, these data reveal the circumstances of TLS dissolution and suggest a functional role for late-stage TLS as sites of T cell memory formation after elimination of viable tumor.\nCell age, not chronological age, governs the dynamics and longevity of circulating CD4+ memory T cells\nAuthors: Bullock, M. E.; Hogan, T.; Morris, S.; Nowicka, M.; van Dorp, C.; Yates, A. J.; Seddon, B.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562650\nQuantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4+ effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, an established fate-mapping system, and mathematical models. Together these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4+ T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We find strong evidence that cell-age effects dominate host-age effects, and that clones become more quiescent and more persistent the longer they reside within the TCM and TEM pools. This behaviour will lead to an increasingly long-tailed distribution of clone sizes as an individual ages. Therefore, the age structure of CD4+ TCM and TEM clones can explain bulk changes in their dynamics and persistence across the lifespan. Author SummaryOur long-term protection against infections depends in part on the maintenance of diverse populations of CD4 memory T cells, which are made in response to the initial exposure to the pathogen or a vaccine. These cells are not long-lived, but instead are maintained dynamically at a clonal level through loss and division. Understanding how immune memory persists therefore requires measuring these rates of these processes, and how they might change with age. Here we combine mouse experiments with mathematical models to show that CD4 memory T cell clones have a complex dynamical structure but become progressively more quiescent with time. Their expected cell lifespan increases as they age, leading to long-tailed survival curves. This dynamic implies that as individuals age, their CD4 memory populations become enriched for older clones that have a fitness advantage over newly generated ones. If these older clones are functionally impaired, this phenomenon may contribute to the waning of immunity in the elderly.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dengue disease is highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. However, its pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to other endemic viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon for dengue viruses. Given the recent surge in dengue cases and potential cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, this study explores the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on DENV-2 infection.

The study assessed the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the DENV-2 Virus. Human convalescent plasma samples collected during different waves of COVID-19 and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 were examined for their potential to cause ADE of DENV-2 infection using cell-based assays. The study found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies acquired from natural infection in humans or through experimental immunization in animals were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and had the potential to enhance DENV-2 infection in K562 and U937 cells. In-silico and in-vitro studies indicated a strong interaction between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV-2 E-protein, providing a molecular basis for these findings. This study is the first to demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can cross-react with DENV-2 and can enhance its infection through ADE. These findings have implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and deployment strategies in regions where dengue is endemic.

SummaryAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (RBD and Spike) showed significant cross reactivity with DENV-2 (E protein). Also, anti-SARS-CoV-2-commercial antibodies, immunised animal sera and 46 human convalescent plasma samples (from different waves of pandemic) demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammatory cytokines are pivotal to immune responses. Upon cytokine exposure, cells enter an &#34;alert-state&#34; that enhances their visibility to the immune system. Here, we identified an &#34;alert-state&#34; subpopulation of ribosomes (ASRs) defined by the presence of the P-stalk. We show that ASRs are formed in response to cytokines linked to tumor immunity, and are involved in the preferential translation of mRNAs vital for the cytokine response.

Mechanistically, ASRs are required for the efficient translation of transmembrane domains of receptor molecules involved in cytokine-mediated processes. Importantly, loss of the ASR prevents CD8&#43; T cell recognition and killing, and inhibitory cytokines like TGF{beta} hinder ASR formation, suggesting that the ASR is a central regulatory hub upon which multiple signals converge. Thus, the ASR is an essential mediator of the cellular rewiring that occurs following cytokine exposure, via the translational regulation of this process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and poses a significant threat to global public health. Although two viral vector vaccines have been approved to prevent Ebola virus disease, they are distributed in the limited ring vaccination setting and only indicated for prevention of infection from orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) - one of three orthoebolavirus species that have caused previous outbreaks. Ebola virus glycoprotein GP mediates viral infection and serves as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe a universal Ebola virus vaccine approach using structure-guided design of candidates with hyperglycosylation that aims to direct antibody responses away from variable regions and toward conserved epitopes of GP. We first determined the hyperglycosylation landscape on Ebola virus GP and used that to generate hyperglycosylated GP variants with two to four additional glycosylation sites to mask the highly variable glycan cap region. We then created vaccine candidates by displaying wild-type or hyperglycosylated GP variants on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Immunization with these antigens elicited potent neutralizing antisera against EBOV in mice. Importantly, we observed consistent cross-neutralizing activity against Bundibugyo virus and Sudan virus from hyperglycosylated GP-Fer with two or three additional glycans. In comparison, elicitation of cross-neutralizing antisera was rare in mice immunized with wild-type GP-Fer. These results demonstrate a potential strategy to develop universal Ebola virus vaccines that confer cross-protective immunity against existing and emerging filovirus species.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEbola virus outbreaks cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. Current viral vaccines require cold-chain storage and are distributed in limited ring vaccination settings. They are only indicated for protection against orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV), one of three human-pathogenic Ebola virus species. Here we harness hyperglycosylation as an immunofocusing approach to design universal Ebola virus vaccine candidates based on Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) displayed on ferritin nanoparticles (Fer). Compared with wild-type GP-Fer, immunization with hyperglycosylated GP-Fer elicited potently neutralizing antisera against EBOV, and more importantly, consistent cross-neutralizing activity against the other two orthoebolavirus species. Our work shows that immunofocusing antibody responses toward conserved and neutralizing epitopes of GP represents a promising strategy for vaccine design against antigenically diverse Ebola virus species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Induction of adaptive immune responses to commensal microbes is critical for tissue homeostasis, and perturbation of these responses is associated with multiple chronic inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and regulation of mucosal B cells targeting commensal microbes remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of tools to identify commensal-specific B cells ex vivo. To address this, we identified immunogenic protein epitopes recognized by Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB)-specific serum antibodies using a whole-genome phage display screen and identified immunogenic proteins engaging IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Using these antigens, we generated B cell tetramers to identify and track SFB-specific B cell responses in the gut associated lymphoid tissue during natural and de novo colonization. We revealed a compartmentalized response in SFB-specific B cell activation between Peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, with a gradient of IgA, IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes along the small intestine, and selective production of IgG2b with the mesenteric lymph node chain. VDJ sequencing analyses and generation of SFB-specific monoclonal antibodies identified that somatic hypermutation drives affinity maturation to SFB derived antigens under homeostatic conditions. By combining phage display screening and B cell tetramer technologies, we now enable antigen-level based studies of immunity to intestinal microbes, which will advance our understanding of the ontogeny and function of commensal-specific B cell responses in tissue immunity, inflammation and repair.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are characteristic of celiac disease (CeD), and TG2-specific IgA plasma cells are abundant in gut biopsies of patients. We here describe the corresponding population of autoreactive B cells in blood. Circulating TG2-specific IgA cells were found in untreated patients on a gluten-containing diet but not in controls. They were clonally related to TG2-specific small intestinal plasma cells, and they expressed gut-homing molecules, indicating that they are plasma cell precursors. Unlike other IgA-switched cells, the TG2-specific cells were negative for CD27, placing them in the double negative (IgD-CD27-) category. They had a plasmablast or activated memory B-cell phenotype, and they harbored fewer variable region mutations than other IgA cells. Based on their similarity to naive B cells, we propose that autoreactive IgA cells in CeD are generated mainly through chronic recruitment of naive B cells via an extrafollicular response involving gluten-specific CD4&#43; T cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibodies are central to the immune response against microbes. We have previously generated a protective IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the M protein, a critical virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we generated this antibody in all human IgG subclasses and evaluated their function. Despite significantly reduced binding, the IgG3 subclass antibody demonstrated remarkably enhanced opsonic function. We hypothesized that increased Fc flexibility could explain this improved efficacy. We engineered a hybrid IgG subclass antibody, IgGh, containing the backbone of IgG1 with the hinge of IgG3, leaving the Fabs unchanged. The IgGh maintained a similar binding ability as IgG1 while gaining the strong opsonic function seen with IgG3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the different antibodies showed altered IgG Fab-antigen interactions, reflecting the differences observed in affinity. More importantly, when the antibodies were bound to the antigen, the simulations showed that the Fc of both IgGh and IgG3 exhibited extensive movement in 3D space relative to the M protein. The increased flexibility of IgGh directly translated to enhanced opsonic function and significantly increased the protection against infection with Streptococcus pyogenes in mice. Our findings demonstrate how altering Fc flexibility can improve Fc-mediated opsonic function and how modifications in the constant domain can regulate Fab-antigen interactions. In addition, the enhanced in vivo function of a more flexible IgG provides new therapeutic opportunities for monoclonal antibodies.

        <p class="abstract">The hair follicle stem cell niche is an immune-privileged microenvironment, characterised by suppressed antigen presentation, thus shielding against permanent immune-mediated tissue damage. In this study, we demonstrate the protective role of hair follicle-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from scarring hair follicle degeneration. Mechanistically, disruption of EGFR signalling generates a cell intrinsic hypersensitivity within the JAK-STAT1 pathway, compromising the immune privilege in the context of CD8 T cell and NK cell-mediated inflammation. Genetic depletion of either JAK1/2 or STAT1 or topical therapeutic inhibition of JAK1/2 restores the immune privilege and activates stem cells to resume hair growth in mouse models of epidermal and hair follicle specific EGFR deletion. Skin biopsies from EGFR inhibitor-treated and from EGFR-independent cicatricial alopecia patients indicate active STAT1 signalling within the hair follicles. Notably, a case study of folliculitis decalvans, characterised by progressive hair loss, scaling and perifollicular erythema, demonstrates successful treatment with systemic JAK1/2 inhibition. Our findings offer mechanistic insights and present a therapeutic strategy for addressing scarring hair follicle destruction associated with EGFR-inhibitor therapy and cicatricial alopecia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (DC1) control anti-tumoral CD8 T responses, in lymph nodes and tumor tissues. T-cell activation depends on the establishment of a tight physical interaction with antigen-presenting cell, the immunological synapse (IS). The molecular determinants of DC1-CD8 IS in tumor tissues and how they are regulated during cancer progression remain poorly investigated. Using a reporter for DC1 in a genetic model of non-small cell lung cancer (KP-XCR1venus) we show that IS in lung tissues are abundant and productive at early stages of tumor development but progressively diminish in advanced tumors. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry of lung resident DC1 identified a module of adhesion molecules downregulated in advanced tumors. We focused on ALCAM and LFA-1, ligands for CD6 and ICAM-1 on T cells, to investigate their role and functional impact. By immobilizing single receptor agonists on artificial cell surfaces, we demonstrate that ALCAM and LFA-1 are sufficient to trigger cytoskeletal remodeling in early tumor DC1, whereas late tumors DC1 are not responsive. Blocking ALCAM-CD6 interactions in functional assays impairs the acquisition of effector functions in CD8 T cells. Together these data highlight that adhesion molecules required to establish IS in early, immune-reactive, tumors are targeted during tumor progression blunting cross-talk within the IS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neoadjuvant immunotherapy is thought to produce long-term remissions through induction of antitumor immune responses before removal of the primary tumor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), germinal center-like structures that can arise within tumors, may contribute to the establishment of immunological memory in this setting, but understanding of their role remains limited. Here, we investigated the contribution of TLS to antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. We found that neoadjuvant immunotherapy induced the formation of TLS, which were associated with superior pathologic response, improved relapse free survival, and expansion of the intratumoral T and B cell repertoire. While TLS in viable tumor displayed a highly active mature morphology, in areas of tumor regression we identified an involuted TLS morphology, which was characterized by dispersion of the B cell follicle and persistence of a T cell zone enriched for ongoing antigen presentation and T cell-mature dendritic cell interactions. Involuted TLS showed increased expression of T cell memory markers and expansion of CD8&#43; cytotoxic and tissue resident memory clonotypes. Collectively, these data reveal the circumstances of TLS dissolution and suggest a functional role for late-stage TLS as sites of T cell memory formation after elimination of viable tumor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Quantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4&#43; effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, an established fate-mapping system, and mathematical models. Together these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4&#43; T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We find strong evidence that cell-age effects dominate host-age effects, and that clones become more quiescent and more persistent the longer they reside within the TCM and TEM pools. This behaviour will lead to an increasingly long-tailed distribution of clone sizes as an individual ages. Therefore, the age structure of CD4&#43; TCM and TEM clones can explain bulk changes in their dynamics and persistence across the lifespan.

Author SummaryOur long-term protection against infections depends in part on the maintenance of diverse populations of CD4 memory T cells, which are made in response to the initial exposure to the pathogen or a vaccine. These cells are not long-lived, but instead are maintained dynamically at a clonal level through loss and division. Understanding how immune memory persists therefore requires measuring these rates of these processes, and how they might change with age. Here we combine mouse experiments with mathematical models to show that CD4 memory T cell clones have a complex dynamical structure but become progressively more quiescent with time. Their expected cell lifespan increases as they age, leading to long-tailed survival curves. This dynamic implies that as individuals age, their CD4 memory populations become enriched for older clones that have a fitness advantage over newly generated ones. If these older clones are functionally impaired, this phenomenon may contribute to the waning of immunity in the elderly.</p>
