A.\nScore: 60.7, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547255\nIgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo.

M.; Drosten, C.\nScore: 26.5, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547076\nSARS-CoV-2 has developed substantial antigenic variability. As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1+E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.\nSingle-cell analysis of signalling and transcriptional responses to type I interferons\nAuthors: Rigby, R. E.; Rue-Albrecht, K.; Sims, D.; Rehwinkel, J.\nScore: 25.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547491\nType I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varied between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.

R.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547454\nCCR7-expressing mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mRegDCs), such as PD-L1, have been identified in tumours and draining lymph nodes (dLN), but their spatiotemporal dynamics and role in anti-tumour immune responses remain unclear. Using photoconvertible mice to precisely track DC migration, we found that mRegDCs comprised the dominant DC population arriving in the dLN, but a subset remained tumour-resident despite CCR7 expression. These tumour-retained mRegDCs were phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from their dLN counterparts and were heterogeneous, with increasing features of an \"exhausted\" transcriptional profile with more prolonged tumour residence. This was characterised by reduced expression of antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory transcripts, and these \"exhaustion\" features were attenuated by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Tumour mRegDCs spatially co-localised with effector CD8+ T cells in human solid tumours, and anti-PD-L1 treatment enhanced their expression of several T cell-stimulatory molecules. Altogether, these data provide fundamental insights into mRegDC biology and their role in cancer immunotherapy.\nMechanistic basis for nigericin-induced NLRP1 inflammasome activation in human epithelial cells\nAuthors: Zhong, F. L.; Rozario, P.; Pinilla, M.; Vind, A. C.; Robinson, K.; Gee Ann, T.; Jasrie Firdaus, M.; Francisco Martinez, J.; Zhewang, L.; Bekker-Jensen, S.; Meunier, E.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546021\nNigericin, an ionophore derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, is arguably the most commonly used tool compound to study the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent findings, however, showed that nigericin also activates the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes. In this study, we resolve the mechanistic basis of nigericin-driven NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In multiple non-hematopoietic cell types, nigericin rapidly and specifically inhibits the elongation stage of the ribosome cycle by depleting cytosolic potassium ions. This activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor kinase ZAK[a], p38 and JNK, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of the NLRP1 linker domain. As a result, nigericin-induced pyroptosis in human keratinocytes is blocked by extracellular potassium supplementation, ZAK[a] knockout or pharmacologic inhibitors of ZAK[a] and p38 kinase activities. By surveying a diverse panel of ionophores, we show that the electroneutrality of potassium efflux is essential to activate ZAK[a]-driven RSR, likely because a greater extent of K+ depletion is necessary to activate ZAK[a]-NLRP1 than NLRP3. These findings resolve the mechanism by which nigericin activates NLRP1 in nonhematopoietic cell types and demonstrate an unexpected connection between RSR, perturbations of potassium ion flux and innate immunity.

It has enabled numerous breakthroughs in the field linking NLRP3 activation to potassium efflux. In this manuscript, we report that nigericin activates an alternate inflammasome sensor, NLRP1 in primary human skin, nasal and corneal epithelial cells. NLRP1 activation by nigericin requires K+ efflux-driven ribosome stalling and the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor MAP3K, ZAK[a]. We further identify the key biophysical principles that explain why only a subset of K+ ionophores, exemplified by nigericin, function as super inflammasome agonists that can activate either NLRP1 or NLRP3, depending on cell type. These results reveal an unexpected connection between RSR, potassium ion flux and innate immunity.\nNeuron-dependent tuft cell expansion initiates sinonasal allergic Type 2 inflammation\nAuthors: Ortiz-Carpena, J. F.; Inclan-Rico, J. M.; Weiner, M. B.; Pastore, C. F.; Hung, L.-Y.; Wilkerson, W. B.; Lin, C.; Gentile, M. E.; Cohen, N. A.; Abdus-Saboor, I.; Vaughan, A. E.; Rossi, H. L.; Herbert, D. R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547596\nIt is unknown whether interactions between tuft cells and trigeminal sinonasal neurons contribute to allergic disease. Intranasal administration of house dust mite or fungal allergens induced tuft cell expansion, eosinophilia, sneezing, Type 2 responses, and neuropeptide release. Mice lacking tuft cells lost these responses but retained eosinophilia and elevated neuropeptides. Ablation of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)+ neurons prevented allergen-evoked tuft cell expansion and eosinophilia without affecting ILC2 and TH2 cell recruitment. Exposure of naive TG neurons to allergen evoked calcium influx and neuropeptide release, but only Substance P (SP) adaptively increased upon repetitive allergen exposure. SP instructed tuft cell lineage commitment and initiated allergic inflammation. Ablation or inhibition of the SP receptor, neurokinin 1, reversed allergen-induced sneezing, tuft cell expansion, and eosinophilia. We propose that sinonasal nociceptors detect protease-containing allergens and adaptively secrete SP to drive tuft cell expansion and early features of Type 2 immunity.\nProlonged T cell - DC macro-clustering within lymph node microenvironments initiates Th2 cell differentiation in a site specific manner\nAuthors: Lyons-Cohen, M. R.; Shamskhou, E.; Gerner, M. Y.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547554\nFormation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent 'macro-clustering' at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.\nInterferons are the key cytokines acting on pancreatic islets in type 1 diabetes\nAuthors: Coomans de Brachene, A.; Alvelos, M.

L.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547000\nThe pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to \"danger signals\" such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.\nImmune-Epithelial Dynamics and Tissue Remodeling in Chronically Inflamed Nasal Epithelium via Multi-scaled Transcriptomics\nAuthors: Liao, G.; Nakayama, T.; Lee, I.

V.; Jiang, S.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547352\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The complex pathophysiology of CRS remains poorly understood, with emerging evidence implicating the orchestration between diverse immune and epithelial cell types in disease progression. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to both dissociated and intact, freshly isolated sinonasal human tissues to investigate the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of CRS with and without nasal polyp formation compared to non-CRS control samples. Our findings reveal a mechanism for macrophage-eosinophil recruitment into the nasal mucosa, systematic dysregulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and enrichment of mast cell populations to the upper airway tissues with intricate interactions between mast cells and CD4 T cells. Additionally, we identify immune-epithelial interactions and dysregulation, particularly involving understudied basal progenitor cells and Tuft chemosensory cells. We further describe a distinct basal cell differential trajectory in CRS patients with nasal polyps (NP), and link it to NP formation through immune-epithelial remodeling. By harnessing stringent patient tissue selection and advanced technologies, our study unveils novel aspects of CRS pathophysiology, and sheds light onto both intricate immune and epithelial cell interactions within the disrupted CRS tissue microenvironment and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings expand upon existing knowledge of nasal inflammation and provide a comprehensive resource towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this uniquely complex disease entity, and beyond.\nEngagement of sialylated glycans with Siglec receptors on myeloid suppressor cells inhibit anti-cancer immunity via CCL2\nAuthors: Wieboldt, R.; Carlini, E.; Chia-wei, L.; Boersch, A.; Zingg, A.; Lardinois, D.; Herzig, P.; Don, L.; Zippelius, A.; Laeubli, H.; Rodrigues Mantuano, N.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547025\nOverexpression of sialic acids on glycans, called hypersialylation is a common alteration found in cancer. Hypersialylation can, for example, enhance immune evasion via interaction with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we tested the role of sialic acid on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their interaction with Siglec receptors. We found that MDSCs derived from the blood of lung cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice strongly express inhibitory Siglec receptors. In murine cancer models of emergency myelopoiesis, Siglec-E knockout on myeloid cells resulted in prolonged survival and increased infiltration of activated T cells. Targeting suppressive myeloid cells by blocking Siglec receptors or desialylation led to strong reduction of their suppressive potential. We further identified CCL2 as mediator involved in T cell suppression upon interaction of sialoglycans and Siglec receptors on MDSCs. Our results provide mechanistic insights how sialylated glycans inhibit anti-cancer immunity by facilitating CCL2 expression.

        <p class="abstract">IgG is a key mediator of immune responses throughout the human body, and the structure of the conserved glycan on the Fc region has been identified as a key inflammatory switch regulating its downstream effects. In particular, the absence of terminal sialic acid has been shown to increase the affinity of IgG for activating Fc receptors, cascading the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases and conditions. Previously, we have shown that IgG sialylation is mediated by B cell-extrinsic processes. Here, we show that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway within endothelial cells is a critical modulator of IgG sialylation. Building a deeper understanding of how IgG sialylation is regulated will drive the development of novel therapeutics which dynamically tune IgG functionality in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has developed substantial antigenic variability. As the majority of the population now has pre-existing immunity due to infection or vaccination, the use of experimentally generated animal immune sera can be valuable for measuring antigenic differences between virus variants. Here, we immunized Syrian hamsters by two successive infections with one of eight SARS-CoV-2 variants. Their sera were titrated against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants and the resulting titers visualized using antigenic cartography. The antigenic map shows a condensed cluster containing all pre-Omicron variants (D614G, Alpha, Delta, Beta, Mu, and an engineered B.1&#43;E484K variant), and a considerably more distributed positioning among a selected panel of Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, the BA.5 descendants BF.7 and BQ.1.18; the BA.2.75 descendant BN.1.3.1; and the BA.2-derived recombinant XBB.2). Some Omicron subvariants were as antigenically distinct from each other as the wildtype is from the Omicron BA.1 variant. The results highlight the potential of using variant-specifically infected hamster sera for the continued antigenic characterisation of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type I interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in antiviral defence, autoinflammation and cancer immunity. The human genome encodes 17 different type I IFNs that all signal through the same receptor. Non-redundant functions have been reported for some type I IFNs. However, whether different type I IFNs induce different responses remains largely unknown. We stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant type I IFNs to address this question in multiple types of primary cells. We analysed signalling responses by mass cytometry and changes in gene expression by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found cell-type specific changes in the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors and in the gene sets induced and repressed upon type I IFN exposure. We further report that the magnitude of these responses varied between different type I IFNs, whilst qualitatively different responses to type I IFN subtypes were not apparent. Taken together, we provide a rich resource mapping signalling responses and IFN-regulated genes in immune cells.

        <p class="abstract">CCR7-expressing mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mRegDCs), such as PD-L1, have been identified in tumours and draining lymph nodes (dLN), but their spatiotemporal dynamics and role in anti-tumour immune responses remain unclear. Using photoconvertible mice to precisely track DC migration, we found that mRegDCs comprised the dominant DC population arriving in the dLN, but a subset remained tumour-resident despite CCR7 expression. These tumour-retained mRegDCs were phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from their dLN counterparts and were heterogeneous, with increasing features of an &#34;exhausted&#34; transcriptional profile with more prolonged tumour residence. This was characterised by reduced expression of antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory transcripts, and these &#34;exhaustion&#34; features were attenuated by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Tumour mRegDCs spatially co-localised with effector CD8&#43; T cells in human solid tumours, and anti-PD-L1 treatment enhanced their expression of several T cell-stimulatory molecules. Altogether, these data provide fundamental insights into mRegDC biology and their role in cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nigericin, an ionophore derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, is arguably the most commonly used tool compound to study the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent findings, however, showed that nigericin also activates the NLRP1 inflammasome in human keratinocytes. In this study, we resolve the mechanistic basis of nigericin-driven NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In multiple non-hematopoietic cell types, nigericin rapidly and specifically inhibits the elongation stage of the ribosome cycle by depleting cytosolic potassium ions. This activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor kinase ZAK[a], p38 and JNK, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of the NLRP1 linker domain. As a result, nigericin-induced pyroptosis in human keratinocytes is blocked by extracellular potassium supplementation, ZAK[a] knockout or pharmacologic inhibitors of ZAK[a] and p38 kinase activities. By surveying a diverse panel of ionophores, we show that the electroneutrality of potassium efflux is essential to activate ZAK[a]-driven RSR, likely because a greater extent of K&#43; depletion is necessary to activate ZAK[a]-NLRP1 than NLRP3. These findings resolve the mechanism by which nigericin activates NLRP1 in nonhematopoietic cell types and demonstrate an unexpected connection between RSR, perturbations of potassium ion flux and innate immunity.

It has enabled numerous breakthroughs in the field linking NLRP3 activation to potassium efflux. In this manuscript, we report that nigericin activates an alternate inflammasome sensor, NLRP1 in primary human skin, nasal and corneal epithelial cells. NLRP1 activation by nigericin requires K&#43; efflux-driven ribosome stalling and the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) sensor MAP3K, ZAK[a]. We further identify the key biophysical principles that explain why only a subset of K&#43; ionophores, exemplified by nigericin, function as  super inflammasome agonists that can activate either NLRP1 or NLRP3, depending on cell type. These results reveal an unexpected connection between RSR, potassium ion flux and innate immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is unknown whether interactions between tuft cells and trigeminal sinonasal neurons contribute to allergic disease. Intranasal administration of house dust mite or fungal allergens induced tuft cell expansion, eosinophilia, sneezing, Type 2 responses, and neuropeptide release. Mice lacking tuft cells lost these responses but retained eosinophilia and elevated neuropeptides. Ablation of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)&#43; neurons prevented allergen-evoked tuft cell expansion and eosinophilia without affecting ILC2 and TH2 cell recruitment. Exposure of naive TG neurons to allergen evoked calcium influx and neuropeptide release, but only Substance P (SP) adaptively increased upon repetitive allergen exposure. SP instructed tuft cell lineage commitment and initiated allergic inflammation. Ablation or inhibition of the SP receptor, neurokinin 1, reversed allergen-induced sneezing, tuft cell expansion, and eosinophilia. We propose that sinonasal nociceptors detect protease-containing allergens and adaptively secrete SP to drive tuft cell expansion and early features of Type 2 immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Formation of T helper 2 (Th2) responses has been attributed to low-grade T cell stimulation, yet how large-scale polyclonal Th2 responses are generated in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used quantitative imaging to investigate early Th2 differentiation within lymph nodes (LNs) following cutaneous allergen administration. Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent &#39;macro-clustering&#39; at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta} and TNF may contribute to innate and adaptive immune responses during islet inflammation (insulitis) in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We used deep RNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the response of human pancreatic beta cells to each cytokine individually and compared the signatures obtained with those present in islets of individuals affected by T1D. IFN and IFN{gamma} had a much greater impact on the beta cell transcriptome when compared to IL-1{beta} and TNF. The IFN-induced gene signatures have a strong correlation with those observed in beta cells from T1D patients, and the level of expression of specific IFN-stimulated genes is positively correlated with proteins present in islets of these individuals, regulating beta cell responses to &#34;danger signals&#34; such as viral infections. These data suggest that IFN and IFN{gamma} are the central cytokines at the islet level in T1D, contributing to the triggering and amplification of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The complex pathophysiology of CRS remains poorly understood, with emerging evidence implicating the orchestration between diverse immune and epithelial cell types in disease progression. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to both dissociated and intact, freshly isolated sinonasal human tissues to investigate the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of CRS with and without nasal polyp formation compared to non-CRS control samples. Our findings reveal a mechanism for macrophage-eosinophil recruitment into the nasal mucosa, systematic dysregulation of CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, and enrichment of mast cell populations to the upper airway tissues with intricate interactions between mast cells and CD4 T cells. Additionally, we identify immune-epithelial interactions and dysregulation, particularly involving understudied basal progenitor cells and Tuft chemosensory cells. We further describe a distinct basal cell differential trajectory in CRS patients with nasal polyps (NP), and link it to NP formation through immune-epithelial remodeling. By harnessing stringent patient tissue selection and advanced technologies, our study unveils novel aspects of CRS pathophysiology, and sheds light onto both intricate immune and epithelial cell interactions within the disrupted CRS tissue microenvironment and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings expand upon existing knowledge of nasal inflammation and provide a comprehensive resource towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this uniquely complex disease entity, and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overexpression of sialic acids on glycans, called hypersialylation is a common alteration found in cancer. Hypersialylation can, for example, enhance immune evasion via interaction with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we tested the role of sialic acid on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their interaction with Siglec receptors. We found that MDSCs derived from the blood of lung cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice strongly express inhibitory Siglec receptors. In murine cancer models of emergency myelopoiesis, Siglec-E knockout on myeloid cells resulted in prolonged survival and increased infiltration of activated T cells. Targeting suppressive myeloid cells by blocking Siglec receptors or desialylation led to strong reduction of their suppressive potential. We further identified CCL2 as mediator involved in T cell suppression upon interaction of sialoglycans and Siglec receptors on MDSCs. Our results provide mechanistic insights how sialylated glycans inhibit anti-cancer immunity by facilitating CCL2 expression.
