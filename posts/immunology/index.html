S.\nScore: 69.6, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.578771\nThe rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.\nSpatial transcriptomics reveals focal induction of molecular responses and cellular interactions in the small intestine during Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection.\nAuthors: Campillo Poveda, M.; Laidlaw, R. F.; Hardy, O.; Otto, T. D.; Maizels, R. M.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579622\nThe infective L3 larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus migrate to the small intestine where they take up residence in the submucosa, triggering the formation of complex granulomas around the parasite. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the transcriptional intricacies and cell-cell interactions of the murine small intestine under both steady-state conditions and in response to H. polygyrus infection. Our findings unveil distinct transcriptional signatures in the crypt zone, villi, and granulomas, providing nuanced insights into the molecular dynamics of the host response to parasitic infection. Molecular characterization of H. polygyrus granulomas reveals unique cellular compositions within distinct clusters, shedding light on localized immune activation and cellular dynamics. Utilizing deconvolution techniques, we uncovered common and infection-specific signatures of cell type colocalization, and identified potential ligand-receptor pairs that may mediate communication between the granuloma tissue and the epithelial crypt cells. Additionally, our study highlights the upregulation of genes such as Ccl9, Fcer1g and Tmsb4x within granulomas, suggesting roles in type 2 inflammation, and genes (e.g Reg3b and Mxra7) associated with wound healing and tissue repair. These results not only enhance our understanding of the murine small intestine's transcriptional landscape but also provide a platform for exploring host-pathogen interactions. The comprehensive analysis presented here contributes to a holistic comprehension of tissue-specific responses during parasitic infections, offering valuable insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.\nEndosomal LRBA regulates the endo-lysosomal pathway\nAuthors: Szentgyoergyi, V.; Lueck, L. M.; Overwijn, D.; Zoeller, N. N.; Hondele, M.; Spang, A.; Bakhtiar, S.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579084\nDeleterious mutations in the LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide Responsive Beige-like Anchor protein) gene cause severe childhood immune dysregulation. The clinical manifestations of LRBA deficiency syndrome are highly variable. Thus, the complexity of the symptoms involving multiple organs and the broad range of unpredictable clinical manifestations complicate the choice of therapeutic interventions. Although LRBA has been linked to Rab11-dependent trafficking of the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, its precise cellular role remains elusive. We show that LRBA, however, does not colocalize with Rab11. Instead, LRBA is recruited by members of the small GTPase Arf protein family to the TGN and to Rab4+ endosomes, where it controls intracellular traffic. In patient-derived fibroblasts, loss of LRBA led to defects in the endosomal pathway yielding the accumulation of enlarged endolysosomes. Thus, LRBA appears to regulate flow through the endosomal system on Rab4+ endosomes. Our data strongly suggest functions of LRBA beyond CTLA-4 trafficking and provide a conceptual framework to develop new therapies for LRBA deficiency. SummaryLRBA-deficient patients exhibit enlarged functional endolysosomes due to defects in recycling to the plasma membrane. LRBA localization on Rab4+ endosomes depends on Arf1 and Arf3, and is essential for a functional endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Our results could inform new treatment options.\nIL-17C plays a role in the pathophysiology of acute recurrent tonsillitis\nAuthors: Clapperton, M.; Kunanandam, T.; Florea, C. D.; Cunningham, M. R.; Douglas, C.; McConnell, G.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.578879\nMost tonsillectomies in the UK are performed to treat acute recurrent tonsillitis (ART) and tonsil hypertrophy due to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). At present, the pathophysiology of these 2 common conditions is still poorly understood. We have performed optical mesoscopic imaging to reveal the spatial location of two interleukins, IL-17C and IL-1 Beta, associated with tonsillar conditions, with the aim of understanding their possible role as specific disease biomarkers. Using immunofluorescence assays, we have shown that the expression of IL-17C is significantly higher in both the epithelial tissue (p \u003c 0.0001) and core tissues (p = 0.0007) of specimens from patients with ART compared to patients with OSA (n = 17 patients). We also demonstrated significantly higher expression of IL-17C in homogenates of ART patient tissue compared to OSA tissue (p = 0.05). These data show the promise of IL-17C as a biomarker for ART and we propose this as a possible new approach to discriminate ART from OSA.\nNF-κB Signaling is Required for X-Chromosome Inactivation Maintenance Following T cell Activation\nAuthors: Forsyth, K. S.; Toothacre, N. E.; Jiwarjka, N.; Driscoll, A. M.; Shallberg, L. A.; Cunningham-Rundles, C.; Barmettler, S.; Farmer, J. R.; Verbsky, J.; Routes, J.; Beiting, D. P.; Romberg, N.; May, M. J.; Anguera, M.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579505\nX Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process which balances X-linked gene dosage between sexes. Unstimulated T cells lack cytological enrichment of Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), and these modifications become enriched at the Xi after cell stimulation. Here, we examined allele-specific gene expression and the epigenomic profiles of the Xi following T cell stimulation. We found that the Xi in unstimulated T cells is largely dosage compensated and is enriched with the repressive H3K27me3 modification, but not the H2AK119-ubiquitin (Ub) mark, even at promoters of XCI escape genes. Upon CD3/CD28-mediated T cell stimulation, the Xi accumulates H2AK119-Ub and H3K27me3 across the Xi. Next, we examined the T cell signaling pathways responsible for Xist RNA localization to the Xi and found that T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, specifically NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of TCR, is required. Disruption of NF-{kappa}B signaling, using inhibitors or genetic deletions, in mice and patients with immunodeficiencies prevents Xist/XIST RNA accumulation at the Xi and alters expression of some X-linked genes. Our findings reveal a novel connection between NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways which impact XCI maintenance in female T cells.\nTamm-Horsfall protein augments neutrophil NETosis during urinary tract infection\nAuthors: Mercado-Evans, V.; Chew, C.; Serchejian, C.; Saltzman, A.; Mejia, M.; Zulk, J.; Cornax, I.; Nizet, V.; Patras, K.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578501\nUrinary neutrophils are a hallmark of urinary tract infection (UTI), yet the mechanisms governing their activation, function, and efficacy in controlling infection remain incompletely understood. Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), the most abundant protein in urine, uses terminal sialic acids to bind an inhibitory receptor and dampen neutrophil inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that neutrophil modulation is an integral part of THP-mediated host protection. In a UTI model, THP-deficient mice showed elevated urinary tract bacterial burdens, increased neutrophil recruitment, and more severe tissue histopathological changes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, THP-deficient mice displayed impaired urinary NETosis during UTI. To investigate the impact of THP on NETosis, we coupled in vitro fluorescence-based NET assays, proteomic analyses, and standard and imaging flow cytometry with peripheral human neutrophils. We found that THP increases proteins involved in respiratory chain, neutrophil granules, and chromatin remodeling pathways, enhances NETosis in an ROS-dependent manner, and drives NET-associated morphologic features including nuclear decondensation. These effects were observed only in the presence of a NETosis stimulus and could not be solely replicated with equivalent levels of sialic acid alone. We conclude that THP is a critical regulator of NETosis in the urinary tract, playing a key role in host defense against UTI.\nMitochondrial Transplantation promotes protective effector and memory CD4+ T cell response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and diminishes exhaustion and senescence in elderly CD4+ T cells\nAuthors: Headley, C. A.; Guatam, s.; Olmo-Fontanez, A. M.; Garcia-Vilanova, A.; Dwivedi, V.; Schami, A. A.; Weintraub, S.; Tsao, P. S.; Torrelles, J. B.; Turner, J.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577036\nTuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), remains a significant health concern worldwide, especially in populations with weakened or compromised immune systems, such as the elderly. Proper adaptive immune function, particularly a CD4+ T cell response, is central to host immunity against M.tb. Chronic infections, such as M.tb, as well as aging promote T cell exhaustion and senescence, which can impair immune control and promote progression to TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T cell dysfunction, both in aging and chronic infections and diseases. Mitochondrial perturbations can disrupt cellular metabolism, enhance oxidative stress, and impair T-cell signaling and effector functions. This study examined the impact of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function using aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Our study revealed that mito-transfer in naive CD4+ T cells promoted the generation of protective effector and memory CD4+ T cells during M.tb infection in mice. Further, mito-transfer enhanced the function of elderly human T cells by increasing their mitochondrial mass and modulating cytokine production, which in turn reduced exhaustion and senescence cell markers. Our results suggest that mito-transfer could be a novel strategy to reestablish aged CD4+ T cell function, potentially improving immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients, with a broader implication for other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to T cell exhaustion and senescence.\nPINK1 is a target of T cell responses in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Williams, G. P.; Michaelis, T.; Rodrigues Lima-Junior, J.; Frazier, A.; Tran, N. K.; Phillips, E. J.; Mallal, S. A.; Litvan, I.; Goldman, J. G.; Alcalay, R. N.; Sidney, J.; Sulzer, D.; Sette, A.; Lindestam Arlehamn, C. S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579465\nParkinson's disease (PD) is associated with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein alpha-synuclein in a subset of individuals. Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN{gamma}, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.\nSystematic Analysis of Immune Changes after B-cell Depletion in Autoimmune Multiple Sclerosis\nAuthors: Wei, J.; Moon, J.; Yasumizu, Y.; Zhang, L.; Radassi, K.; Buitrago-Pocasangre, N.; Deerhake, M. E.; Strauli, N.; Chan, A.; Herman, A.; Pedotte, R.; Raposo, C.; Tackenberg, B.; Yim, I.; Pappalardo, J.; Longbrake, E. E.; Sumida, T. S.; Axisa, P.-P.; Hafler, D. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.576204\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how a therapy-driven \"in vivo perturbation\" modulates the diverse immune landscape by measuring transcriptomic granularity with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. In addition, we observed increases in TNF messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNF treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion also induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different mechanisms of action contributing to the high efficacy in B cell depletion treatment of MS.\nREL2 overexpression in the Anopheles gambiae midgut causes major transcriptional changes but fails to induce an immune response\nAuthors: Hoermann, A.; Capriotti, P.; Del Corsano, G.; Inghilterra, M. G.; Habtewold, T.; Cai, J. A.; Saini, G. S.; Nguyen, H.; Windbichler, N.; Christophides, G. K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578852\nThe NF-{kappa}B-like transcription factor, REL2, is a key player in the mosquito Immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway and holds promise for controlling malaria parasite infections in genetically modified Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We engineered transgenic mosquitoes overexpressing REL2 from within the bloodmeal-inducible zinc carboxypeptidase A1 (CP) host gene in the adult posterior midgut. Our results confirmed elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut following a bloodmeal, with the corresponding protein localized within epithelial cell nuclei. While this induced overexpression triggered substantial transcriptional changes, accompanied by notable fitness costs, the resultant reduction in Plasmodium falciparum infection was modest. An in-depth analysis of regulatory regions of differentially regulated genes allowed us to identify direct REL2 target genes and revealed signatures indicative of potential transcriptional repressors. To account for potential impacts of host gene modification, we also created a CP knockout line that caused marginal effects on mosquito fitness. These findings shed light on the observed absence of transcriptional activation and, in some cases, induced repression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) presumed to be under Imd pathway control. In conclusion, our study suggests that elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut may induce the upregulation of negative immune regulators, facilitating control over an otherwise unrestrained immune response, and that concurrent transcriptional derepression may be needed to effectively induce the mosquito immune response. This work contributes valuable insights into the intricate regulation of midgut immunity in malaria vector mosquitoes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to an update of the COVID-19 booster vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 spike. To determine the neutralization breadth following booster immunization, we collected blood samples from 24 individuals pre- and post-XBB.1.5 mRNA booster vaccination ([~]1 month). The XBB.1.5 booster improved both neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1) and the circulating Omicron variants, including EG.5.1, HK.3, HV.1, XBB.1.5 and JN.1. Relative to the pre-boost titers, the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induced greater total IgG and IgG subclass binding, particular IgG4, to the XBB.1.5 spike as compared to the WA1 spike. We evaluated antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) using either spike or receptor binding domain (RBD) probes and found that the monovalent booster largely increases non-RBD cross-reactive MBCs. These data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster induces cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize XBB.1.5 and related Omicron variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The infective L3 larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus migrate to the small intestine where they take up residence in the submucosa, triggering the formation of complex granulomas around the parasite. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the transcriptional intricacies and cell-cell interactions of the murine small intestine under both steady-state conditions and in response to H. polygyrus infection. Our findings unveil distinct transcriptional signatures in the crypt zone, villi, and granulomas, providing nuanced insights into the molecular dynamics of the host response to parasitic infection. Molecular characterization of H. polygyrus granulomas reveals unique cellular compositions within distinct clusters, shedding light on localized immune activation and cellular dynamics. Utilizing deconvolution techniques, we uncovered common and infection-specific signatures of cell type colocalization, and identified potential ligand-receptor pairs that may mediate communication between the granuloma tissue and the epithelial crypt cells. Additionally, our study highlights the upregulation of genes such as Ccl9, Fcer1g and Tmsb4x within granulomas, suggesting roles in type 2 inflammation, and genes (e.g Reg3b and Mxra7) associated with wound healing and tissue repair. These results not only enhance our understanding of the murine small intestine&#39;s transcriptional landscape but also provide a platform for exploring host-pathogen interactions. The comprehensive analysis presented here contributes to a holistic comprehension of tissue-specific responses during parasitic infections, offering valuable insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deleterious mutations in the LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide Responsive Beige-like Anchor protein) gene cause severe childhood immune dysregulation. The clinical manifestations of LRBA deficiency syndrome are highly variable. Thus, the complexity of the symptoms involving multiple organs and the broad range of unpredictable clinical manifestations complicate the choice of therapeutic interventions. Although LRBA has been linked to Rab11-dependent trafficking of the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, its precise cellular role remains elusive. We show that LRBA, however, does not colocalize with Rab11. Instead, LRBA is recruited by members of the small GTPase Arf protein family to the TGN and to Rab4&#43; endosomes, where it controls intracellular traffic. In patient-derived fibroblasts, loss of LRBA led to defects in the endosomal pathway yielding the accumulation of enlarged endolysosomes. Thus, LRBA appears to regulate flow through the endosomal system on Rab4&#43; endosomes. Our data strongly suggest functions of LRBA beyond CTLA-4 trafficking and provide a conceptual framework to develop new therapies for LRBA deficiency.

SummaryLRBA-deficient patients exhibit enlarged functional endolysosomes due to defects in recycling to the plasma membrane. LRBA localization on Rab4&#43; endosomes depends on Arf1 and Arf3, and is essential for a functional endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Our results could inform new treatment options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most tonsillectomies in the UK are performed to treat acute recurrent tonsillitis (ART) and tonsil hypertrophy due to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). At present, the pathophysiology of these 2 common conditions is still poorly understood. We have performed optical mesoscopic imaging to reveal the spatial location of two interleukins, IL-17C and IL-1 Beta, associated with tonsillar conditions, with the aim of understanding their possible role as specific disease biomarkers. Using immunofluorescence assays, we have shown that the expression of IL-17C is significantly higher in both the epithelial tissue (p &lt; 0.0001) and core tissues (p = 0.0007) of specimens from patients with ART compared to patients with OSA (n = 17 patients). We also demonstrated significantly higher expression of IL-17C in homogenates of ART patient tissue compared to OSA tissue (p = 0.05). These data show the promise of IL-17C as a biomarker for ART and we propose this as a possible new approach to discriminate ART from OSA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process which balances X-linked gene dosage between sexes. Unstimulated T cells lack cytological enrichment of Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), and these modifications become enriched at the Xi after cell stimulation. Here, we examined allele-specific gene expression and the epigenomic profiles of the Xi following T cell stimulation. We found that the Xi in unstimulated T cells is largely dosage compensated and is enriched with the repressive H3K27me3 modification, but not the H2AK119-ubiquitin (Ub) mark, even at promoters of XCI escape genes. Upon CD3/CD28-mediated T cell stimulation, the Xi accumulates H2AK119-Ub and H3K27me3 across the Xi. Next, we examined the T cell signaling pathways responsible for Xist RNA localization to the Xi and found that T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, specifically NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of TCR, is required. Disruption of NF-{kappa}B signaling, using inhibitors or genetic deletions, in mice and patients with immunodeficiencies prevents Xist/XIST RNA accumulation at the Xi and alters expression of some X-linked genes. Our findings reveal a novel connection between NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways which impact XCI maintenance in female T cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urinary neutrophils are a hallmark of urinary tract infection (UTI), yet the mechanisms governing their activation, function, and efficacy in controlling infection remain incompletely understood. Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), the most abundant protein in urine, uses terminal sialic acids to bind an inhibitory receptor and dampen neutrophil inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that neutrophil modulation is an integral part of THP-mediated host protection. In a UTI model, THP-deficient mice showed elevated urinary tract bacterial burdens, increased neutrophil recruitment, and more severe tissue histopathological changes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, THP-deficient mice displayed impaired urinary NETosis during UTI. To investigate the impact of THP on NETosis, we coupled in vitro fluorescence-based NET assays, proteomic analyses, and standard and imaging flow cytometry with peripheral human neutrophils. We found that THP increases proteins involved in respiratory chain, neutrophil granules, and chromatin remodeling pathways, enhances NETosis in an ROS-dependent manner, and drives NET-associated morphologic features including nuclear decondensation. These effects were observed only in the presence of a NETosis stimulus and could not be solely replicated with equivalent levels of sialic acid alone. We conclude that THP is a critical regulator of NETosis in the urinary tract, playing a key role in host defense against UTI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), remains a significant health concern worldwide, especially in populations with weakened or compromised immune systems, such as the elderly. Proper adaptive immune function, particularly a CD4&#43; T cell response, is central to host immunity against M.tb. Chronic infections, such as M.tb, as well as aging promote T cell exhaustion and senescence, which can impair immune control and promote progression to TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T cell dysfunction, both in aging and chronic infections and diseases. Mitochondrial perturbations can disrupt cellular metabolism, enhance oxidative stress, and impair T-cell signaling and effector functions. This study examined the impact of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4&#43; T cell differentiation and function using aged mouse models and human CD4&#43; T cells from elderly individuals. Our study revealed that mito-transfer in naive CD4&#43; T cells promoted the generation of protective effector and memory CD4&#43; T cells during M.tb infection in mice. Further, mito-transfer enhanced the function of elderly human T cells by increasing their mitochondrial mass and modulating cytokine production, which in turn reduced exhaustion and senescence cell markers. Our results suggest that mito-transfer could be a novel strategy to reestablish aged CD4&#43; T cell function, potentially improving immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients, with a broader implication for other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to T cell exhaustion and senescence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is associated with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein alpha-synuclein in a subset of individuals. Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN{gamma}, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how a therapy-driven &#34;in vivo perturbation&#34; modulates the diverse immune landscape by measuring transcriptomic granularity with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16&#43; monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. In addition, we observed increases in TNF messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNF treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion also induced changes in peripheral CD4&#43; T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT&#43; regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4&#43; T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different mechanisms of action contributing to the high efficacy in B cell depletion treatment of MS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The NF-{kappa}B-like transcription factor, REL2, is a key player in the mosquito Immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway and holds promise for controlling malaria parasite infections in genetically modified Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. We engineered transgenic mosquitoes overexpressing REL2 from within the bloodmeal-inducible zinc carboxypeptidase A1 (CP) host gene in the adult posterior midgut. Our results confirmed elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut following a bloodmeal, with the corresponding protein localized within epithelial cell nuclei. While this induced overexpression triggered substantial transcriptional changes, accompanied by notable fitness costs, the resultant reduction in Plasmodium falciparum infection was modest. An in-depth analysis of regulatory regions of differentially regulated genes allowed us to identify direct REL2 target genes and revealed signatures indicative of potential transcriptional repressors. To account for potential impacts of host gene modification, we also created a CP knockout line that caused marginal effects on mosquito fitness. These findings shed light on the observed absence of transcriptional activation and, in some cases, induced repression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) presumed to be under Imd pathway control. In conclusion, our study suggests that elevated REL2 expression in the posterior midgut may induce the upregulation of negative immune regulators, facilitating control over an otherwise unrestrained immune response, and that concurrent transcriptional derepression may be needed to effectively induce the mosquito immune response. This work contributes valuable insights into the intricate regulation of midgut immunity in malaria vector mosquitoes.</p>
