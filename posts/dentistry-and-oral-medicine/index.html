The primary objective of this manuscript is to create and validate a deep learning technique for precise evaluation of alveolar bone loss in bitewing radiographs. Additionally, surveys were conducted with dental professionals to determine accuracy of visualized measures of ACH for severe periodontal disease versus the deep learning program and to determine the acceptability of utility of the program among diverse dental professionals. Lastly, the deep learning program was utilized in research to evaluate the role of COVID on periodontal disease through longitudinal measures of bitewing radiograph ACH from patients during the: \"pre-pandemic\" (Feb 2017 - Feb 2020) and \"post-pandemic\" (Feb 2020 - Feb 2023) periods. The pre-pandemic group had a mean percentage loss of ACH of -1.74 + 16.5%, representing a gain in alveolar bone. In contrast, the post-pandemic group had a gain in ACH of 2.46 + 14.6%, representing a loss in alveolar bone. There remained a trend for greater annualized percent change in ACH in the post-pandemic vs pre-pandemic group (1.33 + 11.9% vs -0.94 + 12.5%, p=0.07), after accounting for differences in duration between xrays. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful training and validation of a deep learning program for ACH measurement as well as its utility and acceptability among dental professionals for clinical and research.\nOccupational Exposure and Observance of Standard Precautions Among Bucco-dental Health Workers in Referral Hospitals (Yaounde, Cameroon)\nAuthors: Takougang, I.; Fojuh Mbognou, Z.; Lekeumo Cheuyem, F. Z.; Nouko, A.; Lowe, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298984\nBackground: The risk of infection during dental practices is omnipresent for both patients and healthcare workers. Workers within the bucco-dental health services are among the most affected. The most reported infectious agents transmitted through blood and body fluids are Human Immunodeficiency Virus, viral hepatitis B and C. Compliance with standard precautions prevents exposure to hospital associated infections that are acquired through exposure needle sticks and splashes in healthcare settings. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the level of implementation and constraints to the observance of standard precautions in bucco-dental services. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in five referral hospitals in Yaounde, from March to April 2021, involving a purposeful selection of 40 bucco-dental health workers (BDHW). Workers were submitted to a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire covering their knowledge, level of observance of standard precautions and experiences of occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids. The data collected were analyzed using IBM SPSS software version 26. Results: Out of the 53 bucco-dental health workers (BDHW) who were selected for inclusion, 40 provided responses for a participation rate of 75.5%. The mean age of participants was 30.65 years and the M/F sex ratio was 0.54. Half of participants (58.5%) had a good overall level of knowledge of standard precautions. Less than a quarter of participants (12.5%) were compliant with standard precautions. Only 35% of BDHW had received training on hospital infection control, while 60% reported to have experience a needle stick injury in the last three months. Gaps in the observance of standard precautions included the lack of disinfectants (70%), application of hand washing techniques and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Less than half of participant (47,5%) were fully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Conclusion: Most bucco-dental health workers had insufficient knowledge of standard precautions, most of whom had experienced needlestick injuries and accidental exposure to body fluids, and were at high risk of hospital acquired infections. There is an urgent need to establish and strengthen hospital-based infection control committees to ensure training and implementation of infection prevention measures in local healthcare settings. A framework for the nationwide scale up of such interventions should be explored.\n",
