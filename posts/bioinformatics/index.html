However, a high-quality protein structure is required and often the protein is treated as fully or partially rigid. Here we develop an AI system that can predict the fully flexible all-atom structure of protein-ligand complexes directly, given a multiple sequence alignment representation of the protein and a SMILES string representing the ligand. At a high accuracy threshold, unseen protein-ligand complexes can be predicted more accurately than for RoseTTAFold-AA, and at medium accuracy even classical docking methods that use known protein structures as input are surpassed. The high accuracy presented here suggests that the goal of AI-based drug discovery is one step closer, but there is still a way to go to fully grasp the complexity of protein-ligand interactions. Umol is available at: https://github.com/patrickbryant1/Umol\nCellChat for systematic analysis of cell-cell communication from single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics\nAuthors: Jin, S.; Plikus, M. V.; Nie, Q.\nScore: 57.0, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565674\nRecent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies offer an opportunity to explore cell-cell communication in tissues systematically and with reduced bias. A key challenge is the integration between known molecular interactions and measurements into a framework to identify and analyze complex cell-cell communication networks. Previously, we developed a computational tool, named CellChat that infers and analyzes cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data within an easily interpretable framework. CellChat quantifies the signaling communication probability between two cell groups using a simplified mass action-based model, which incorporates the core interaction between ligands and receptors with multi-subunit structure along with modulation by cofactors. CellChat v2 is an updated version that includes direct incorporation of spatial locations of cells, if available, to infer spatially proximal cell-cell communication, additional comparison functionalities, expanded database of ligand-receptor pairs along with rich annotations, and an Interactive CellChat Explorer. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol for using CellChat v2 that can be used for both scRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomic data, including inference and analysis of cell-cell communication from one dataset and identification of altered signaling across different datasets. The key steps of applying CellChat v2 to spatially resolved transcriptomics are described in detail. The R implementation of CellChat v2 toolkit and tutorials with the graphic outputs are available at https://github.com/jinworks/CellChat. This protocol typically takes around 20 minutes, and no specialized prior bioinformatics training is required to complete the task.\nPredmoter - Cross-species prediction of plant promoter and enhancer regions\nAuthors: Kindel, F.; Triesch, S.; Schlueter, U.; Randarevitch, L. A.; Reichel-Deland, V.; Weber, A.; Denton, A. K.\nScore: 43.7, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565452\nMotivationThe identification of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) is crucial for the analysis of gene regulatory networks in plants. Several next generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods were developed to identify CREs. However, these methods can be time-consuming and costly. They also involve creating sequencing libraries for the entire genome. Since many research efforts only focus on specific genomic loci, this presents a considerable expenditure. Computational prediction of the outputs of specialized NGS methods to analyze CREs, like Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), would significantly cut costs and time investment. Yet, no such method is available to date. ResultsWe present Predmoter, a deep neural network able to predict base-wise ATAC-seq and histone Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) read coverage for plant genomes. Predmoter uses only the DNA sequence as input. We evaluated our model on two plant genomes, the genome of the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and of the monocot Oryza sativa. We trained our models on 10 species with publicly available ATAC-seq data and 15 species with ChIP-seq data. Our best models showed accurate predictions in peak positions and the overall pattern of peaks for ATAC- and Histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq. Annotating putatively accessible chromatin regions provides valuable input for the identification of CREs. In conjunction with other in silico data, such as predicted binding affinities for transcription factors (TFs), this can significantly narrow down the search space to a manageable number of experimentally verifiable DNA-protein interaction pairs. Availability and ImplementationThe source code for Predmoter is available at: https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/Predmoter along with documentation for installation and usage. Predmoter uses a single-command inference, Predmoter.py, for both training and prediction. Predmoter takes a fasta file as input and outputs an h5 file and optionally bigWig and bedGraph files. HighlightPredmoter will help identifying CREs and so gaining further insight into gene regulatory networks in plants.\nIntegrating single-cell RNA-seq datasets with substantial batch effects\nAuthors: Hrovatin, K.; Moinfar, A. A.; Tejada Lapuerta, A.; Zappia, L.; Lengerich, B.; Kellis, M.; Theis, F. J.\nScore: 36.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565463\nComputational methods for integrating scRNA-seq datasets often struggle to harmonize datasets with substantial differences driven by technical or biological variation, such as between different species, organoids and primary tissue, or different scRNA-seq protocols, including single-cell and single-nuclei. Given that many widely adopted and scalable methods are based on conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE), we hypothesize that machine learning interventions to standard cVAEs can help improve batch effect removal while potentially preserving biological variation more effectively. To address this, we assess four strategies applied to commonly used cVAE models: the previously proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) regularization tuning and adversarial learning, as well as cycle-consistency loss (previously applied to multi-omic integration) and the multimodal variational mixture of posteriors prior (VampPrior) that has not yet been applied to integration. We evaluated performance in three data settings, namely cross-species, organoid-tissue, and cell-nuclei integration. Cycle-consistency and VampPrior improved batch correction while retaining high biological preservation, with their combination further increasing performance. While adversarial learning led to the strongest batch correction, its preservation of within-cell type variation did not match that of VampPrior or cycle-consistency models, and it was also prone to mixing unrelated cell types with different proportions across batches. KL regularization strength tuning had the least favorable performance, as it jointly removed biological and batch variation by reducing the number of effectively used embedding dimensions. Based on our findings, we recommend the adoption of the VampPrior in combination with the cycle-consistency loss for integrating datasets with substantial batch effects.\nTRAFICA: Improving Transcription Factor Binding Affinity Prediction using Large Language Model on ATAC-seq Data\nAuthors: Xu, Y.; Wang, C.; Xu, K.; Ding, Y.; Lyu, A.; Zhang, L.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565416\nIn silico prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding affinity plays a vital role in determining TF binding preferences and understanding gene regulation. Many existing tools utilize known TF-DNA binding data to train conventional machine learning and deep learning models to predict TF-DNA binding affinities. The majority of these tools do not consider the natural preferences of DNA sequences binding to TFs, which could be influenced by chromatin accessibility. In this study, we developed TRAFICA, a deep language model to predict TF-DNA binding affinities by integrating chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq and known TF-DNA binding data. We pre-trained TRAFICA on an integrated ATAC-seq dataset with over 13 million nucleotide sequences in a self-supervised manner to learn potential TF-DNA binding preferences and contextual relationships within DNA sequences. TRAFICA was fine-tuned using PBM and HT-SELEX datasets to predict in vitro TF-DNA binding affinities. We also implemented AdapterFusion to enhance its ability to predict in vivo TF-DNA binding affinities. We observed TRAFICA significantly outperformed the six existing tools in predicting in vitro TF-DNA binding affinities and was comparable with the best tool on in vivo prediction.\nIdentifying cell states in single-cell RNA-seq data at statistically maximal resolution\nAuthors: Grobecker, P.; van Nimwegen, E.\nScore: 45.5, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564980\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with similar expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionalityreduction, employ ad hoc measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important marker genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.\nBenchmarking of small and large variants across tandem repeats\nAuthors: English, A.; Dolzhenko, E.; Ziaei-Jam, H.; Olson, N. D.; Mckenzie, S.; De Coster, W.; Park, J.; Gu, B.; Wagner, J.; Eberle, M.; Gymrek, M.; Chaisson, M.; Zook, J. M.; Sedlazeck, F. J.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564632\nTandem repeats (TRs) are highly polymorphic in the human genome, have thousands of associated molecular traits, and are linked to over 60 disease phenotypes. However, their complexity often excludes them from at-scale studies due to challenges with variant calling, representation, and lack of a genome-wide standard. To promote TR methods development, we create a comprehensive catalog of TR regions and explore its properties across 86 samples. We then curate variants from the GIAB HG002 individual to create a tandem repeat benchmark. We also present a variant comparison method that handles small and large alleles and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds [~]24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 TR benchmark. We work with the GIAB community to demonstrate the utility of this benchmark across short and long read technologies.\nOn the limits of 16S rRNA gene-based metagenome prediction and functional profiling\nAuthors: Matchado, M. S.; Ruhlemann, M. C.; Reimeiter, S.; Kacprowski, T.; Frost, F.; Haller, D.; Baumbach, J.; List, M.\nScore: 20.0, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.564315\nMolecular profiling techniques such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics or metabolomics offer important insights into the functional diversity of the microbiome. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a widespread and cost-effective technique to measure microbial diversity, only allows for indirect estimation of microbial function. To mitigate this, tools such as PICRUSt2, Tax4Fun2, PanFP and MetGEM infer functional profiles from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using different algorithms. Prior studies have cast doubts on the quality of these predictions, motivating us to systematically evaluate these tools using matched 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic datasets, and simulated data. Our contribution is threefold: (i) using simulated data, we investigate if technical biases could explain the discordance between inferred and expected results; (ii) considering human cohorts for type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and obesity, we test if health-related differential abundance measures of functional categories are concordant between 16S rRNA gene-inferred and metagenome-derived profiles and; (iii) since 16S rRNA gene copy number is an important confounder in functional profiles inference, we investigate if a customised copy number normalisation with the rrnDB database could improve the results. Our results show that 16S rRNA gene-based functional inference tools generally do not have the necessary sensitivity to delineate health-related functional changes in the microbiome and should thus be used with care. Furthermore, we outline important differences in the individual tools tested and offer recommendations for tool selection.\nreconcILS: A gene tree-species tree reconciliation algorithm that allows for incomplete lineage sorting\nAuthors: Mishra, S.; Smith, M. L.; Hahn, M. W.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565544\nReconciliation algorithms provide an accounting of the evolutionary history of individual gene trees given a species tree. Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss. We discuss how our method can also be extended in the future for use as a reconciliation algorithm in additional scenarios. AvailabilityreconcILS is implemented in Python 3 and is available at https://github.com/smishra677/ reconcILS. The dupcoal simulator is implemented in Python 3 and is available at https://github.com/meganlsmith/dupcoal\nBioenergetic mapping of 'healthy microbiomes' via compound processing potential imprinted in gut and soil metagenomes\nAuthors: Liddicoat, C.; Edwards, R. A.; Roach, M. J.; Robinson, J. M.; Wallace, K. J.; Barnes, A. D.; Brame, J.; Heintz-Buschart, A.; Cavagnaro, T. R.; Dinsdale, E. A.; Doane, M. P.; Eisenhauer, N.; Mitchell, G.; Rai, B.; Ramesh, S.; Breed, M. F.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.565728\nMicrobiomes are critical to the health and functioning of humans and ecosystems. Defining healthy microbiomes, however, remains elusive. More advanced knowledge exists on health associations for the compounds used or produced by microbes. Because microbes, their feedstocks and micro-environments interact synchronously, using functional genes to facilitate chemical transformations, this presents an intriguing opportunity to examine microbiomes through their potential to process compounds associated with human health. There is also growing interest in environmental microbiota that might be efficient at processing health-associated compounds because these microbes may readily transfer to humans and environmental interventions could modulate our exposure to them. Here we propose a bioenergetic mapping approach to microbiome assessments that examines the compound processing potential imprinted in human gut and environmental soil metagenomes. From shotgun metagenomics functional profiling, we derive quantitative measures of compound processing potential for human health-associated compound classes (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates) and selected biomolecules of interest (e.g., vitamins, short-chain fatty acids). We mapped microbial functions to compounds using the complexity-reducing van Krevelen bioenergetic mapping framework, based on carbon-hydrogen-oxygen stoichiometry and principal axes that explain variation in microbial distribution and chemical speciation. We found differences in compound processing potential within gut metagenomes comparing health- and disease-associated samples, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and anxious-depressive behaviors. Patterns of compound processing potential in soil metagenomes were linked with ecosystem maturity. Assessment of compound processing potential offers a new lens to explore mechanisms of microbiome-mediated human health including connections to health-promoting environmental microbiomes. Significance StatementDespite mounting evidence of their importance, the definition and measurement of healthy microbiomes remain unclear. Knowledge gaps hinder development of microbiota-oriented approaches in human health, including potential for environmental interventions. By integrating interdisciplinary knowledge frameworks including functional genomics and biochemistry, we derive summary measures of potential for human gut and environmental soil metagenomes to process major compound classes and biomolecules linked to human health. Measures of compound processing potential were linked with states of human health and disease; and displayed seemingly predictable shifts along gradients of ecological disturbance in plant-soil systems. Compound processing potential offers a simplifying approach for applying powerful and otherwise complex metagenomics in ongoing efforts to understand and quantify the role of microbiota in human- and environmental-health.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protein-ligand docking is an established tool in drug discovery and development to narrow down potential therapeutics for experimental testing. However, a high-quality protein structure is required and often the protein is treated as fully or partially rigid. Here we develop an AI system that can predict the fully flexible all-atom structure of protein-ligand complexes directly, given a multiple sequence alignment representation of the protein and a SMILES string representing the ligand. At a high accuracy threshold, unseen protein-ligand complexes can be predicted more accurately than for RoseTTAFold-AA, and at medium accuracy even classical docking methods that use known protein structures as input are surpassed. The high accuracy presented here suggests that the goal of AI-based drug discovery is one step closer, but there is still a way to go to fully grasp the complexity of protein-ligand interactions.

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies offer an opportunity to explore cell-cell communication in tissues systematically and with reduced bias. A key challenge is the integration between known molecular interactions and measurements into a framework to identify and analyze complex cell-cell communication networks. Previously, we developed a computational tool, named CellChat that infers and analyzes cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data within an easily interpretable framework. CellChat quantifies the signaling communication probability between two cell groups using a simplified mass action-based model, which incorporates the core interaction between ligands and receptors with multi-subunit structure along with modulation by cofactors. CellChat v2 is an updated version that includes direct incorporation of spatial locations of cells, if available, to infer spatially proximal cell-cell communication, additional comparison functionalities, expanded database of ligand-receptor pairs along with rich annotations, and an Interactive CellChat Explorer. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol for using CellChat v2 that can be used for both scRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomic data, including inference and analysis of cell-cell communication from one dataset and identification of altered signaling across different datasets. The key steps of applying CellChat v2 to spatially resolved transcriptomics are described in detail. The R implementation of CellChat v2 toolkit and tutorials with the graphic outputs are available at https://github.com/jinworks/CellChat. This protocol typically takes around 20 minutes, and no specialized prior bioinformatics training is required to complete the task.</p>

        <p class="abstract">MotivationThe identification of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) is crucial for the analysis of gene regulatory networks in plants. Several next generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods were developed to identify CREs. However, these methods can be time-consuming and costly. They also involve creating sequencing libraries for the entire genome. Since many research efforts only focus on specific genomic loci, this presents a considerable expenditure. Computational prediction of the outputs of specialized NGS methods to analyze CREs, like Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), would significantly cut costs and time investment. Yet, no such method is available to date.

ResultsWe present Predmoter, a deep neural network able to predict base-wise ATAC-seq and histone Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) read coverage for plant genomes. Predmoter uses only the DNA sequence as input. We evaluated our model on two plant genomes, the genome of the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and of the monocot Oryza sativa. We trained our models on 10 species with publicly available ATAC-seq data and 15 species with ChIP-seq data. Our best models showed accurate predictions in peak positions and the overall pattern of peaks for ATAC- and Histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq. Annotating putatively accessible chromatin regions provides valuable input for the identification of CREs. In conjunction with other in silico data, such as predicted binding affinities for transcription factors (TFs), this can significantly narrow down the search space to a manageable number of experimentally verifiable DNA-protein interaction pairs.

Availability and ImplementationThe source code for Predmoter is available at: https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/Predmoter along with documentation for installation and usage. Predmoter uses a single-command inference, Predmoter.py, for both training and prediction. Predmoter takes a fasta file as input and outputs an h5 file and optionally bigWig and bedGraph files.

HighlightPredmoter will help identifying CREs and so gaining further insight into gene regulatory networks in plants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computational methods for integrating scRNA-seq datasets often struggle to harmonize datasets with substantial differences driven by technical or biological variation, such as between different species, organoids and primary tissue, or different scRNA-seq protocols, including single-cell and single-nuclei. Given that many widely adopted and scalable methods are based on conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE), we hypothesize that machine learning interventions to standard cVAEs can help improve batch effect removal while potentially preserving biological variation more effectively. To address this, we assess four strategies applied to commonly used cVAE models: the previously proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) regularization tuning and adversarial learning, as well as cycle-consistency loss (previously applied to multi-omic integration) and the multimodal variational mixture of posteriors prior (VampPrior) that has not yet been applied to integration. We evaluated performance in three data settings, namely cross-species, organoid-tissue, and cell-nuclei integration. Cycle-consistency and VampPrior improved batch correction while retaining high biological preservation, with their combination further increasing performance. While adversarial learning led to the strongest batch correction, its preservation of within-cell type variation did not match that of VampPrior or cycle-consistency models, and it was also prone to mixing unrelated cell types with different proportions across batches. KL regularization strength tuning had the least favorable performance, as it jointly removed biological and batch variation by reducing the number of effectively used embedding dimensions. Based on our findings, we recommend the adoption of the VampPrior in combination with the cycle-consistency loss for integrating datasets with substantial batch effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In silico prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding affinity plays a vital role in determining TF binding preferences and understanding gene regulation. Many existing tools utilize known TF-DNA binding data to train conventional machine learning and deep learning models to predict TF-DNA binding affinities. The majority of these tools do not consider the natural preferences of DNA sequences binding to TFs, which could be influenced by chromatin accessibility. In this study, we developed TRAFICA, a deep language model to predict TF-DNA binding affinities by integrating chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq and known TF-DNA binding data. We pre-trained TRAFICA on an integrated ATAC-seq dataset with over 13 million nucleotide sequences in a self-supervised manner to learn potential TF-DNA binding preferences and contextual relationships within DNA sequences. TRAFICA was fine-tuned using PBM and HT-SELEX datasets to predict in vitro TF-DNA binding affinities. We also implemented AdapterFusion to enhance its ability to predict in vivo TF-DNA binding affinities. We observed TRAFICA significantly outperformed the six existing tools in predicting in vitro TF-DNA binding affinities and was comparable with the best tool on in vivo prediction.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with  similar expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionalityreduction, employ ad hoc measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods.

Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters.

We show that, on synthetic datasets, CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the CO_SCPLOWELLSTATESC_SCPLOW tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important marker genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly polymorphic in the human genome, have thousands of associated molecular traits, and are linked to over 60 disease phenotypes. However, their complexity often excludes them from at-scale studies due to challenges with variant calling, representation, and lack of a genome-wide standard. To promote TR methods development, we create a comprehensive catalog of TR regions and explore its properties across 86 samples. We then curate variants from the GIAB HG002 individual to create a tandem repeat benchmark. We also present a variant comparison method that handles small and large alleles and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds [~]24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 TR benchmark. We work with the GIAB community to demonstrate the utility of this benchmark across short and long read technologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular profiling techniques such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics or metabolomics offer important insights into the functional diversity of the microbiome. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a widespread and cost-effective technique to measure microbial diversity, only allows for indirect estimation of microbial function. To mitigate this, tools such as PICRUSt2, Tax4Fun2, PanFP and MetGEM infer functional profiles from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using different algorithms. Prior studies have cast doubts on the quality of these predictions, motivating us to systematically evaluate these tools using matched 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic datasets, and simulated data. Our contribution is threefold: (i) using simulated data, we investigate if technical biases could explain the discordance between inferred and expected results; (ii) considering human cohorts for type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and obesity, we test if health-related differential abundance measures of functional categories are concordant between 16S rRNA gene-inferred and metagenome-derived profiles and; (iii) since 16S rRNA gene copy number is an important confounder in functional profiles inference, we investigate if a customised copy number normalisation with the rrnDB database could improve the results. Our results show that 16S rRNA gene-based functional inference tools generally do not have the necessary sensitivity to delineate health-related functional changes in the microbiome and should thus be used with care. Furthermore, we outline important differences in the individual tools tested and offer recommendations for tool selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reconciliation algorithms provide an accounting of the evolutionary history of individual gene trees given a species tree. Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss. We discuss how our method can also be extended in the future for use as a reconciliation algorithm in additional scenarios.

        <p class="abstract">Microbiomes are critical to the health and functioning of humans and ecosystems. Defining  healthy microbiomes, however, remains elusive. More advanced knowledge exists on health associations for the compounds used or produced by microbes. Because microbes, their feedstocks and micro-environments interact synchronously, using functional genes to facilitate chemical transformations, this presents an intriguing opportunity to examine microbiomes through their potential to process compounds associated with human health. There is also growing interest in environmental microbiota that might be efficient at processing health-associated compounds because these microbes may readily transfer to humans and environmental interventions could modulate our exposure to them. Here we propose a bioenergetic mapping approach to microbiome assessments that examines the compound processing potential imprinted in human gut and environmental soil metagenomes. From shotgun metagenomics functional profiling, we derive quantitative measures of compound processing potential for human health-associated compound classes (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates) and selected biomolecules of interest (e.g., vitamins, short-chain fatty acids). We mapped microbial functions to compounds using the complexity-reducing van Krevelen bioenergetic mapping framework, based on carbon-hydrogen-oxygen stoichiometry and principal axes that explain variation in microbial distribution and chemical speciation. We found differences in compound processing potential within gut metagenomes comparing health- and disease-associated samples, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and anxious-depressive behaviors. Patterns of compound processing potential in soil metagenomes were linked with ecosystem maturity. Assessment of compound processing potential offers a new lens to explore mechanisms of microbiome-mediated human health including connections to health-promoting environmental microbiomes.

Significance StatementDespite mounting evidence of their importance, the definition and measurement of  healthy microbiomes remain unclear. Knowledge gaps hinder development of microbiota-oriented approaches in human health, including potential for environmental interventions. By integrating interdisciplinary knowledge frameworks including functional genomics and biochemistry, we derive summary measures of potential for human gut and environmental soil metagenomes to process major compound classes and biomolecules linked to human health. Measures of compound processing potential were linked with states of human health and disease; and displayed seemingly predictable shifts along gradients of ecological disturbance in plant-soil systems. Compound processing potential offers a simplifying approach for applying powerful and otherwise complex metagenomics in ongoing efforts to understand and quantify the role of microbiota in human- and environmental-health.</p>
