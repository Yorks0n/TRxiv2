Traditionally, phylogenies are inferred from manually curated sets of marker genes. As available genomic data increases, there is increasing demand for tools to automatically build phylogeny from assembled genomes. Existing tools rely on reference databases of preselected marker genes, limiting their taxonomic scope. We sought to develop a tool that could quickly build phylogeny from input genomes alone. We developed getphylo, a tool to automatically generate multi-locus phylogenetic trees from GenBank files. It has a low barrier to entry with minimal dependencies. getphylo uses a parallelised, heuristic workflow to keep runtime and system requirements as low as possible. getphylo consistently produces trees with topologies comparable to other tools in at least half the time. Furthermore, as getphylo does not rely on reference databases, it has a virtually unlimited scope in terms of taxonomy (e.g., not limited to bacteria) and genetic scale (e.g., can analyse plasmids, prophage, and gene clusters). This combination of speed and flexibility makes getphylo a valuable addition to the phylogenetics toolkit.\nContext-Dependent Design of Induced-fit Enzymes using Deep Learning Generates Well Expressed, Thermally Stable and Active Enzymes\nAuthors: Zimmerman, L.; Alon, N.; Levin, I.; Koganitsky, A.; Shpigel, N.; Brestel, C.; Lapidoth, G. D.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550799\nThe potential of engineered enzymes in practical applications is often constrained by limitations in their expression levels, thermal stability, and the diversity and magnitude of catalytic activities. De-novo enzyme design, though exciting, is challenged by the complex nature of enzymatic catalysis. An alternative promising approach involves expanding the capabilities of existing natural enzymes to enable functionality across new substrates and operational parameters. To this end we introduce CoSaNN (Conformation Sampling using Neural Network), a novel strategy for enzyme design that utilizes advances in deep learning for structure prediction and sequence optimization. By controlling enzyme conformations, we can expand the chemical space beyond the reach of simple mutagenesis. CoSaNN uses a context-dependent approach that accurately generates novel enzyme designs by considering non-linear relationships in both sequence and structure space. Additionally, we have further developed SolvIT, a graph neural network trained to predict protein solubility in E.Coli, as an additional optimization layer for producing highly expressed enzymes. Through this approach, we have engineered novel enzymes exhibiting superior expression levels, with 54% of our designs expressed in E.Coli, and increased thermal stability with more than 30% of our designs having a higher Tm than the template enzyme. Furthermore, our research underscores the transformative potential of AI in protein design, adeptly capturing high order interactions and preserving allosteric mechanisms in extensively modified enzymes. These advancements pave the way for the creation of diverse, functional, and robust enzymes, thereby opening new avenues for targeted biotechnological applications.\nChallenges in identifying mRNA transcript starts and ends from long-read sequencing data\nAuthors: Calvo-Roitberg, E.; Daniels, R. F.; Pai, A. A.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550536\nLong-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have the potential to revolutionize scientific discoveries in RNA biology, especially by enabling the comprehensive identification and quantification of full length mRNA isoforms. However, inherently high error rates make the analysis of long-read sequencing data challenging. While these error rates have been characterized for sequence and splice site identification, it is still unclear how accurately LRS reads represent transcript start and end sites. Here, we systematically assess the variability and accuracy of mRNA terminal ends identified by LRS reads across multiple sequencing platforms. We find substantial inconsistencies in both the start and end coordinates of LRS reads spanning a gene, such that LRS reads often fail to accurately recapitulate annotated or empirically derived terminal ends of mRNA molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach to condition reads based on empirically derived terminal ends and identified a subset of reads that are more likely to represent full-length transcripts. Our approach can improve transcriptome analyses by enhancing the fidelity of transcript terminal end identification, but may result in lower power to quantify genes or discover novel isoforms. Thus, it is necessary to be cautious when selecting sequencing approaches and/or interpreting data from long-read RNA sequencing.\nChromatinHD connects single-cell DNA accessibility and conformation to gene expression through scale-adaptive machine learning\nAuthors: Saelens, W.; Pushkarev, O.; Deplancke, B.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.549899\n1Machine learning methods that fully exploit the dual modality of single-cell RNA+ATAC-seq techniques are still lacking. Here, we developed ChromatinHD, a pair of models that uses the raw accessibility data, with-out peak-calling or windows, to predict gene expression and determine differentially accessible chromatin. We show how both models consistently outperform existing peak and window-based approaches, and find that this is due to a considerable amount of functional accessibility changes within and outside of putative cis-regulatory regions, both of which are uniquely captured by our models. Furthermore, ChromatinHD can delineate collaborating regions including their preferential genomic conformations that drive gene expression. Finally, our models also use changes in ATAC-seq fragment lengths to identify dense binding of transcription factors, a feature not captured by footprinting methods. Altogether, ChromatinHD, available at https://deplanckelab.github.io/ChromatinHD, is a suite of computational tools that enables a data-driven understanding of chromatin accessibility at various scales and how it relates to gene expression.\nhadge: a comprehensive pipeline for donor deconvolution in single cell\nAuthors: Curion, F.; Wu, X.; Heumos, L.; Andre, M. G.; Halle, L.; Grant-Peters, M.; Rich-Griffin, C.; Yeung, H.-Y.; Dendrou, C. A.; Schiller, H. B.; Theis, F. J.\nScore: 24.0, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550061\nSingle cell multiplexing techniques (cell hashing and genetic multiplexing) allow to combine multiple samples, thereby optimizing sample processing and reducing batch effects. Cell hashing conjugates antibody-tags or chemical-oligonucleotides to cell membranes, while genetic multiplexing allows to mix genetically diverse samples and relies on aggregation of RNA reads at known genomic coordinates. We developed hadge (hashing deconvolution combined with genotype information), a Nextflow pipeline that combines 12 methods to perform both hashing- and genotype-based deconvolution. We propose a joint deconvolution strategy combining the best performing methods and we demonstrate how this approach leads to recovery of previously discarded cells in a nuclei hashing of fresh-frozen brain tissue.\nProstT5: Bilingual Language Model for Protein Sequence and Structure\nAuthors: Heinzinger, M.; Weissenow, K.; Sanchez, J. G.; Henkel, A.; Steinegger, M.; Rost, B.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550085\nAdvanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their adaptation to protein sequences spawned the development of powerful protein language models (pLMs). Concurrently, AlphaFold2 broke through in protein structure prediction. For the first time, we can now systematically and comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act and exist as three-dimensional (3D) machines and evolve in linear strings of one-dimensional (1D) sequences. Here, we leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities by combining 1D sequences with 3D structure in one generic model. For this, we encode protein structures as token sequences using the 3Di-alphabet introduced by Foldseek. The resulting \"structure-sequence\" representation is processed by a pLM to extract features and patterns. Toward this end, we constructed a non-redundant dataset from AlphaFoldDB and fine-tuned an existing pLM (ProtT5) to translate between 3Di and amino acid sequences. As a proof-of-concept for our novel approach, dubbed Protein structure-sequence T5 (ProstT5), we showed improved performance for subsequent prediction tasks, and for \"inverse folding\", namely the generation of novel protein sequences adopting a given structural scaffold (\"fold\"). Our work showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by AlphaFold2. It paves the way for the development of tools optimizing the integration of this vast 3D structure data resource, opening new research avenues in the post AlphaFold2 era. We released our model at https://github.com/mheinzinger/ProstT5.\nClusterDE: a post-clustering differential expression (DE) method robust to false-positive inflation caused by double dipping\nAuthors: Song, D.; Li, K.; Ge, X.; Li, J. J.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550107\nIn typical single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a clustering algorithm is applied to find putative cell types as clusters, and then a statistical differential expression (DE) test is used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the cell clusters. However, this common procedure uses the same data twice, an issue known as \"double dipping\": the same data is used to define both cell clusters and DE genes, leading to false-positive DE genes even when the cell clusters are spurious. To overcome this challenge, we propose ClusterDE, a post-clustering DE test for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of identified DE genes regardless of clustering quality. The core idea of ClusterDE is to generate real-data-based synthetic null data with only one cluster, as a counterfactual in contrast to the real data, for evaluating the whole procedure of clustering followed by a DE test. Using comprehensive simulation and real data analysis, we show that ClusterDE has not only solid FDR control but also the ability to find cell-type marker genes that are biologically meaningful. ClusterDE is fast, transparent, and adaptive to a wide range of clustering algorithms and DE tests. Besides scRNA-seq data, ClusterDE is generally applicable to post-clustering DE analysis, including single-cell multi-omics data analysis.\nAlphaFold2 models of the active form of all 437 catalytically-competent typical human kinase domains\nAuthors: Faezov, B.; Dunbrack, R. L.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550125\nHumans have 437 catalytically competent protein kinase domains with the typical kinase fold, similar to the structure of Protein Kinase A (PKA). Additionally, there are 57 pseudokinases with the typical kinase domain but without phosphorylation activity. Only 268 of the 437 catalytic typical protein kinases are currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) in various functional forms. The active form of a kinase must satisfy requirements for binding ATP, magnesium, and substrate. From the structures of 40 unique substrate-bound kinases, as well as many structures with bound ATP, we derived several criteria for the active form of protein kinases. These criteria include: 1) the DFGin position of the DFG-Phe side chain; 2) the \"BLAminus\" conformation based on the backbone and side-chain dihedral angles of the XDFG motif which we previously characterized as required for ATP binding (Modi and Dunbrack, PNAS, 2019); 3) the existence of an N-terminal domain salt bridge between a conserved Glu residue of the C-helix and a conserved Lys of the N-terminal domain beta sheet; 4) backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds of the sixth residue of the activation loop (DFGxxX) and the residue preceding the HRD motif (\"X-HRD\"); and 5) a contact (or near contact) between the C atom of the APE9 residue (9 residues before the C-terminus of the activation loop) and the carbonyl oxygen of the Arg residue of the HRD motif. These last two requirements underscore the structural interplay between the activation loop and the catalytic loop containing the HRD motif that serve to construct a groove capable of binding substrate. With these criteria, only 155 of 437 catalytic kinase domains (35%) are present in the PDB; only 130 kinase domains (30%) are in the PDB with complete coordinates for the activation loop. Because the active form of catalytic kinases is needed for understanding substrate specificity and the effects of mutations on catalytic activity in cancer and other diseases, we used AlphaFold2 to produce models of all 437 human protein kinases in the active form. We used active structures we identified from the PDB as templates for AlphaFold2 (AF2) as well as shallow sequence alignments of orthologous kinases from Uniprot (\u003e50% sequence identity to each query) for the multiple sequence alignments required by AF2. We select models for each kinase based on the pLDDT scores of the activation loop residues, demonstrating that the highest scoring models have the lowest or close to the lowest RMSD to 22 non-redundant substrate-bound structures in the PDB. A larger benchmark of 130 active kinase structures with complete activation loops in the PDB shows that 80% of the highest-scoring AlphaFold2 models have RMSD \u003c 1.0 [A] and 90% have RMSD \u003c 2.0 [A] over the activation loop backbone atoms. We show that several of the benchmark structures from the PDB may be artifacts that are not likely to bind substrate and that the AlphaFold2 models are closer to substrate-bound structures of closely related kinases. Models for all 437 catalytic kinases are available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/kincore/activemodels. We believe they may be useful for interpreting mutations leading to constitutive catalytic activity in cancer as well as for templates for modeling substrate and inhibitor binding for molecules which bind to the active state.\nEfficient High-Quality Metagenome Assembly from Long Accurate Reads using Minimizer-space de Bruijn Graphs\nAuthors: Benoit, G.; Raguideau, S.; James, R.; Phillippy, A. M.; Chikhi, R.; Quince, C.\nScore: 73.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548136\nWe introduce a novel metagenomics assembler for high-accuracy long reads. Our approach, implemented as metaMDBG, combines highly efficient de Bruijn graph assembly in minimizer space, with both a multi-k' approach for dealing with variations in genome coverage depth and an abundance-based filtering strategy for simplifying strain complexity. The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art but with better assembly results. metaMDBG was 1.5 to 12 times faster than competing assemblers and requires between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the memory across a range of data sets. We obtained up to twice as many high-quality circularised prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) on the most complex communities, and a better recovery of viruses and plasmids. metaMDBG performs particularly well for abundant organisms whilst being robust to the presence of strain diversity. The result is that for the first time it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the majority of complex communities by abundance as nearcomplete MAGs.\nSensitive remote homology search by local alignment of small positional embeddings from protein language models\nAuthors: Johnson, S. R.; Peshwa, M.; Sun, Z.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550718\nAccurately detecting distant evolutionary relationships between proteins remains an ongoing challenge in bioinformatics. Search methods based on primary sequence struggle to accurately detect homology between sequences with less than 20% amino acid identity. Profile- and structure-based strategies extend sensitive search capabilities into this twilight zone of sequence similarity but require slow pre-processing steps. Recently, whole-protein and positional embeddings from deep neural networks have shown promise for providing sensitive sequence comparison and annotation at long evolutionary distances. Embeddings are generally faster to compute than profiles and predicted structures but still suffer several drawbacks related to the ability of whole-protein embeddings to discriminate domain-level homology, and the database size and search speed of methods using positional embeddings. In this work, we show that low-dimensionality positional embeddings can be used directly in speed-optimized local search algorithms. As a proof of concept, we use the ESM2 3B model to convert primary sequences directly into the 3Di alphabet or amino acid profiles and use these embeddings as input to the highly optimized Foldseek, HMMER3, and HH-suite search algorithms. Our results suggest that positional embeddings as small as a single byte can provide sufficient information for dramatically improved sensitivity over amino acid sequence searches without sacrificing search speed.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Phylogenetic trees are the primary tool for visualising evolutionary relationships. Traditionally, phylogenies are inferred from manually curated sets of marker genes. As available genomic data increases, there is increasing demand for tools to automatically build phylogeny from assembled genomes. Existing tools rely on reference databases of preselected marker genes, limiting their taxonomic scope. We sought to develop a tool that could quickly build phylogeny from input genomes alone. We developed getphylo, a tool to automatically generate multi-locus phylogenetic trees from GenBank files. It has a low barrier to entry with minimal dependencies. getphylo uses a parallelised, heuristic workflow to keep runtime and system requirements as low as possible. getphylo consistently produces trees with topologies comparable to other tools in at least half the time. Furthermore, as getphylo does not rely on reference databases, it has a virtually unlimited scope in terms of taxonomy (e.g., not limited to bacteria) and genetic scale (e.g., can analyse plasmids, prophage, and gene clusters). This combination of speed and flexibility makes getphylo a valuable addition to the phylogenetics toolkit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The potential of engineered enzymes in practical applications is often constrained by limitations in their expression levels, thermal stability, and the diversity and magnitude of catalytic activities. De-novo enzyme design, though exciting, is challenged by the complex nature of enzymatic catalysis. An alternative promising approach involves expanding the capabilities of existing natural enzymes to enable functionality across new substrates and operational parameters. To this end we introduce CoSaNN (Conformation Sampling using Neural Network), a novel strategy for enzyme design that utilizes advances in deep learning for structure prediction and sequence optimization. By controlling enzyme conformations, we can expand the chemical space beyond the reach of simple mutagenesis. CoSaNN uses a context-dependent approach that accurately generates novel enzyme designs by considering non-linear relationships in both sequence and structure space. Additionally, we have further developed SolvIT, a graph neural network trained to predict protein solubility in E.Coli, as an additional optimization layer for producing highly expressed enzymes. Through this approach, we have engineered novel enzymes exhibiting superior expression levels, with 54% of our designs expressed in E.Coli, and increased thermal stability with more than 30% of our designs having a higher Tm than the template enzyme. Furthermore, our research underscores the transformative potential of AI in protein design, adeptly capturing high order interactions and preserving allosteric mechanisms in extensively modified enzymes. These advancements pave the way for the creation of diverse, functional, and robust enzymes, thereby opening new avenues for targeted biotechnological applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have the potential to revolutionize scientific discoveries in RNA biology, especially by enabling the comprehensive identification and quantification of full length mRNA isoforms. However, inherently high error rates make the analysis of long-read sequencing data challenging. While these error rates have been characterized for sequence and splice site identification, it is still unclear how accurately LRS reads represent transcript start and end sites. Here, we systematically assess the variability and accuracy of mRNA terminal ends identified by LRS reads across multiple sequencing platforms. We find substantial inconsistencies in both the start and end coordinates of LRS reads spanning a gene, such that LRS reads often fail to accurately recapitulate annotated or empirically derived terminal ends of mRNA molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach to condition reads based on empirically derived terminal ends and identified a subset of reads that are more likely to represent full-length transcripts. Our approach can improve transcriptome analyses by enhancing the fidelity of transcript terminal end identification, but may result in lower power to quantify genes or discover novel isoforms. Thus, it is necessary to be cautious when selecting sequencing approaches and/or interpreting data from long-read RNA sequencing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1Machine learning methods that fully exploit the dual modality of single-cell RNA&#43;ATAC-seq techniques are still lacking. Here, we developed ChromatinHD, a pair of models that uses the raw accessibility data, with-out peak-calling or windows, to predict gene expression and determine differentially accessible chromatin. We show how both models consistently outperform existing peak and window-based approaches, and find that this is due to a considerable amount of functional accessibility changes within and outside of putative cis-regulatory regions, both of which are uniquely captured by our models. Furthermore, ChromatinHD can delineate collaborating regions including their preferential genomic conformations that drive gene expression. Finally, our models also use changes in ATAC-seq fragment lengths to identify dense binding of transcription factors, a feature not captured by footprinting methods. Altogether, ChromatinHD, available at https://deplanckelab.github.io/ChromatinHD, is a suite of computational tools that enables a data-driven understanding of chromatin accessibility at various scales and how it relates to gene expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single cell multiplexing techniques (cell hashing and genetic multiplexing) allow to combine multiple samples, thereby optimizing sample processing and reducing batch effects. Cell hashing conjugates antibody-tags or chemical-oligonucleotides to cell membranes, while genetic multiplexing allows to mix genetically diverse samples and relies on aggregation of RNA reads at known genomic coordinates. We developed hadge (hashing deconvolution combined with genotype information), a Nextflow pipeline that combines 12 methods to perform both hashing- and genotype-based deconvolution. We propose a joint deconvolution strategy combining the best performing methods and we demonstrate how this approach leads to recovery of previously discarded cells in a nuclei hashing of fresh-frozen brain tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their adaptation to protein sequences spawned the development of powerful protein language models (pLMs). Concurrently, AlphaFold2 broke through in protein structure prediction. For the first time, we can now systematically and comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act and exist as three-dimensional (3D) machines and evolve in linear strings of one-dimensional (1D) sequences. Here, we leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities by combining 1D sequences with 3D structure in one generic model. For this, we encode protein structures as token sequences using the 3Di-alphabet introduced by Foldseek. The resulting &#34;structure-sequence&#34; representation is processed by a pLM to extract features and patterns. Toward this end, we constructed a non-redundant dataset from AlphaFoldDB and fine-tuned an existing pLM (ProtT5) to translate between 3Di and amino acid sequences. As a proof-of-concept for our novel approach, dubbed Protein structure-sequence T5 (ProstT5), we showed improved performance for subsequent prediction tasks, and for &#34;inverse folding&#34;, namely the generation of novel protein sequences adopting a given structural scaffold (&#34;fold&#34;). Our work showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by AlphaFold2. It paves the way for the development of tools optimizing the integration of this vast 3D structure data resource, opening new research avenues in the post AlphaFold2 era. We released our model at https://github.com/mheinzinger/ProstT5.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In typical single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a clustering algorithm is applied to find putative cell types as clusters, and then a statistical differential expression (DE) test is used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the cell clusters. However, this common procedure uses the same data twice, an issue known as &#34;double dipping&#34;: the same data is used to define both cell clusters and DE genes, leading to false-positive DE genes even when the cell clusters are spurious. To overcome this challenge, we propose ClusterDE, a post-clustering DE test for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of identified DE genes regardless of clustering quality. The core idea of ClusterDE is to generate real-data-based synthetic null data with only one cluster, as a counterfactual in contrast to the real data, for evaluating the whole procedure of clustering followed by a DE test. Using comprehensive simulation and real data analysis, we show that ClusterDE has not only solid FDR control but also the ability to find cell-type marker genes that are biologically meaningful. ClusterDE is fast, transparent, and adaptive to a wide range of clustering algorithms and DE tests. Besides scRNA-seq data, ClusterDE is generally applicable to post-clustering DE analysis, including single-cell multi-omics data analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Humans have 437 catalytically competent protein kinase domains with the typical kinase fold, similar to the structure of Protein Kinase A (PKA). Additionally, there are 57 pseudokinases with the typical kinase domain but without phosphorylation activity. Only 268 of the 437 catalytic typical protein kinases are currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) in various functional forms. The active form of a kinase must satisfy requirements for binding ATP, magnesium, and substrate. From the structures of 40 unique substrate-bound kinases, as well as many structures with bound ATP, we derived several criteria for the active form of protein kinases. These criteria include: 1) the DFGin position of the DFG-Phe side chain; 2) the &#34;BLAminus&#34; conformation based on the backbone and side-chain dihedral angles of the XDFG motif which we previously characterized as required for ATP binding (Modi and Dunbrack, PNAS, 2019); 3) the existence of an N-terminal domain salt bridge between a conserved Glu residue of the C-helix and a conserved Lys of the N-terminal domain beta sheet; 4) backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds of the sixth residue of the activation loop (DFGxxX) and the residue preceding the HRD motif (&#34;X-HRD&#34;); and 5) a contact (or near contact) between the C atom of the APE9 residue (9 residues before the C-terminus of the activation loop) and the carbonyl oxygen of the Arg residue of the HRD motif. These last two requirements underscore the structural interplay between the activation loop and the catalytic loop containing the HRD motif that serve to construct a groove capable of binding substrate. With these criteria, only 155 of 437 catalytic kinase domains (35%) are present in the PDB; only 130 kinase domains (30%) are in the PDB with complete coordinates for the activation loop. Because the active form of catalytic kinases is needed for understanding substrate specificity and the effects of mutations on catalytic activity in cancer and other diseases, we used AlphaFold2 to produce models of all 437 human protein kinases in the active form. We used active structures we identified from the PDB as templates for AlphaFold2 (AF2) as well as shallow sequence alignments of orthologous kinases from Uniprot (&gt;50% sequence identity to each query) for the multiple sequence alignments required by AF2. We select models for each kinase based on the pLDDT scores of the activation loop residues, demonstrating that the highest scoring models have the lowest or close to the lowest RMSD to 22 non-redundant substrate-bound structures in the PDB. A larger benchmark of 130 active kinase structures with complete activation loops in the PDB shows that 80% of the highest-scoring AlphaFold2 models have RMSD &lt; 1.0 [A] and 90% have RMSD &lt; 2.0 [A] over the activation loop backbone atoms. We show that several of the benchmark structures from the PDB may be artifacts that are not likely to bind substrate and that the AlphaFold2 models are closer to substrate-bound structures of closely related kinases. Models for all 437 catalytic kinases are available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/kincore/activemodels. We believe they may be useful for interpreting mutations leading to constitutive catalytic activity in cancer as well as for templates for modeling substrate and inhibitor binding for molecules which bind to the active state.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce a novel metagenomics assembler for high-accuracy long reads. Our approach, implemented as metaMDBG, combines highly efficient de Bruijn graph assembly in minimizer space, with both a multi-k&#39; approach for dealing with variations in genome coverage depth and an abundance-based filtering strategy for simplifying strain complexity. The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art but with better assembly results. metaMDBG was 1.5 to 12 times faster than competing assemblers and requires between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the memory across a range of data sets. We obtained up to twice as many high-quality circularised prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) on the most complex communities, and a better recovery of viruses and plasmids. metaMDBG performs particularly well for abundant organisms whilst being robust to the presence of strain diversity. The result is that for the first time it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the majority of complex communities by abundance as nearcomplete MAGs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurately detecting distant evolutionary relationships between proteins remains an ongoing challenge in bioinformatics. Search methods based on primary sequence struggle to accurately detect homology between sequences with less than 20% amino acid identity. Profile- and structure-based strategies extend sensitive search capabilities into this twilight zone of sequence similarity but require slow pre-processing steps. Recently, whole-protein and positional embeddings from deep neural networks have shown promise for providing sensitive sequence comparison and annotation at long evolutionary distances. Embeddings are generally faster to compute than profiles and predicted structures but still suffer several drawbacks related to the ability of whole-protein embeddings to discriminate domain-level homology, and the database size and search speed of methods using positional embeddings. In this work, we show that low-dimensionality positional embeddings can be used directly in speed-optimized local search algorithms. As a proof of concept, we use the ESM2 3B model to convert primary sequences directly into the 3Di alphabet or amino acid profiles and use these embeddings as input to the highly optimized Foldseek, HMMER3, and HH-suite search algorithms. Our results suggest that positional embeddings as small as a single byte can provide sufficient information for dramatically improved sensitivity over amino acid sequence searches without sacrificing search speed.</p>
