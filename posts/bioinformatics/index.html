A singular view of this vast and growing expression landscape could help reveal novel associations between cell states and diseases, discover cell states in unexpected tissue contexts, and relate in vivo cells to in vitro models. However, these require a common, scalable representation of cell profiles from across the body, a general measure of their similarity, and an efficient way to query these data. Here, we present SCimilarity, a metric learning framework to learn and search a unified and interpretable representation that annotates cell types and instantaneously queries for a cell state across tens of millions of profiles. We demonstrate SCimilarity on a 22.7 million cell corpus assembled across 399 published scRNA-seq studies, showing accurate integration, annotation and querying. We experimentally validated SCimilarity by querying across tissues for a macrophage subset originally identified in interstitial lung disease, and showing that cells with similar profiles are found in other fibrotic diseases, tissues, and a 3D hydrogel system, which we then repurposed to yield this cell state in vitro. SCimilarity serves as a foundational model for single cell gene expression data and enables researchers to query for similar cellular states across the entire human body, providing a powerful tool for generating novel biological insights from the growing Human Cell Atlas.\nUnified fate mapping in multiview single-cell data\nAuthors: Weiler, P.; Lange, M.; Klein, M.; Pe'er, D.; Theis, F.\nScore: 119.9, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549685\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing allows us to model cellular state dynamics and fate decisions using expression similarity or RNA velocity to reconstruct state-change trajectories. However, trajectory inference does not incorporate valuable time point information or utilize additional modalities, while methods that address these different data views cannot be combined and do not scale. Here, we present CellRank 2, a versatile and scalable framework to study cellular fate using multiview single-cell data of up to millions of cells in a unified fashion. CellRank 2 consistently recovers terminal states and fate probabilities across data modalities in human hematopoiesis and mouse endodermal development. Our framework also allows combining transitions within and across experimental time points, a feature we use to recover genes promoting medullary thymic epithelial cell formation during pharyngeal endoderm development. Moreover, we enable estimating cell-specific transcription and degradation rates from metabolic labeling data, which we apply to an intestinal organoid system to delineate differentiation trajectories and pinpoint regulatory strategies.\nkmindex and ORA: indexing and real-time user-friendly queries in terabytes-sized complex genomic datasets\nAuthors: Lemane, T.; Lezzoche, N.; Lecubin, J.; Pelletier, E.; Lescot, M.; Chikhi, R.; Peterlongo, P.\nScore: 56.5, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.543043\nPublic sequencing databases contain vast amounts of biological information, yet they are largely underutilized as one cannot efficiently search them for any sequence of interest. We present kmindex, an innovative approach that can index thousands of highly complex metagenomes and perform sequence searches in a fraction of a second. The construction of the index is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, while search times are two orders of magnitude faster. With negligible false positive rates below 0.01%, kmindex outperforms the precision of existing approaches by four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the scalability of kmindex by successfully indexing 1,393 complex marine seawater metagenome samples from the Tara Oceans project. Additionally, we introduce the publicly accessible web server \"Ocean Read Atlas\" (ORA) at https://ocean-read-atlas.mio.osupytheas.fr/, which enables real-time queries on the entire Tara Oceans dataset. The open-source kmindex software is available at https://github.com/tlemane/kmindex.\nScalable and efficient DNA sequencing analysis on different compute infrastructures aiding variant discovery\nAuthors: Hanssen, F.; Garcia, M. U.; Folkersen, L.; Pedersen, A. S.; Lescai, F.; Jodoin, S.; Miller, E.; Wacker, O.; Smith, N.; nf-core community, ; Gabernet, G.; Nahnsen, S.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549462\nDNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3.x, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low. The code is available at https://nf-co.re/sarek.\nSpecies-aware DNA language models capture regulatory elements and their evolution\nAuthors: Karollus, A.; Hingerl, J.; Gankin, D.; Grosshauser, M.; Klemon, K.; Gagneur, J.\nScore: 29.2, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.26.525670\nThe rise of large-scale multi-species genome sequencing projects promises to shed new light on how genomes encode gene regulatory instructions. To this end, new algorithms are needed that can leverage conservation to capture regulatory elements while accounting for their evolution. Here we introduce species-aware DNA language models (LMs), which we trained on more than 800 species spanning over 500 million years of evolution. Investigating their ability to predict masked nucleotides from context, we show that DNA LMs distinguish transcription factor and RNA-binding protein motifs from background non-coding sequence. Owing to their flexibility, DNA LMs capture conserved regulatory elements over much further evolutionary distances than sequence alignment would allow. Remarkably, DNA LMs reconstruct motif instances bound in vivo better than unbound ones and account for the evolution of motif sequences and their positional constraints, showing that these models capture functional high-order sequence and evolutionary context. We further show that species-aware training yields improved sequence representations for endogenous and MPRA-based gene expression prediction, as well as motif discovery. Collectively, these results demonstrate that species-aware DNA language models are a powerful, flexible, and scalable tool to integrate information from large compendia of highly diverged genomes.\nTopOMetry systematically learns and evaluates the latent dimensions of single-cell atlases\nAuthors: Sidarta-Oliveira, D.; Velloso, L. A.\nScore: 39.0, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.14.484134\nA core task in single-cell data analysis is recovering the latent dimensions encoding the genetic and epigenetic landscapes inhabited by cell types and lineages. However, consensus is lacking for optimal modeling and visualization approaches. Here, we propose these landscapes are ideally modeled as Riemannian manifolds and present TopOMetry, a computational toolkit based on Laplacian-type operators to learn these manifolds. TopOMetry systematically learns and evaluates dozens of possible representations, eliminating the need to choose a single dimensional reduction method a priori. The learned visualizations preserve more original information than current PCA-based standards across single-cell and non-biological datasets. TopOMetry allows users to estimate intrinsic dimensionalities and visualize distortions with the Riemannian metric, among other challenging tasks. Illustrating its hypothesis generation power, TopOMetry suggests the existence of dozens of novel T cell subpopulations consistently found across public datasets that correspond to specific clonotypes. TopOMetry is available at https://github.com/davisidarta/topometry.\nPredicting cell morphological responses to perturbations using generative modeling\nAuthors: Palma, A.; Theis, F. J.; Lotfollahi, M.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549216\nAdvancements in high-throughput screening have enabled the exploration of rich phenotypic readouts like high-content microscopy, expediting drug target identification and mode of action studies. However, scaling these experiments to the vast space of drug or genetic manipulations poses challenges, as only a small subset of compounds show activity in screenings. Despite being widely used in various applications, machine learning methods have not shown a reliable ability to extrapolate predictions to scenarios involving unseen phenomena, specifically transforming an unseen control cell image into a desired perturbation. We present a generative model, the IMage Perturbation Autoencoder (IMPA), which predicts cellular morphological effects of chemical and genetic perturbations using untreated cells as input. IMPA learns perturbation-specific styles from generalized embeddings and generates counterfactual treatment response predictions in control cells. We demonstrate IMPA can predict morphological changes caused by small molecule perturbations on breast cancer cells. Additionally, we test IMPA on the unseen drug effect prediction task, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art generative models when compounds are structurally related to the training set. Finally, generalizability and capability to predict more subtle effects are showcased through its application to large microscopy datasets with hundreds of genetic perturbations on U2OS cells. We envision IMPA to become a valuable tool in computational microscopy for aiding phenotypic drug discovery, facilitating navigation of the perturbation space, and rational experimental design.\nBenchmarking software tools for trimming adapters and merging next-generation sequencing data for ancient DNA\nAuthors: Lien, A.; Pestana Legori, L.; Kraft, L.; Wad Sackett, P.; Renaud, G.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549303\nAncient DNA is highly degraded, resulting in very short sequences. Reads generated with modern high-throughput sequencing machines are generally longer than ancient DNA molecules, therefore the reads often contain some portion of the sequencing adaptors. It is crucial to remove those adaptors, as they can interfere with downstream analysis. Furthermore, overlapping portions when DNA has been read forward and backward (paired-end) can be merged to correct sequencing errors and improve read quality. Several tools have been developed for adapter trimming and read merging, however, no one has attempted to evaluate their accuracy and evaluate their potential impact on downstream analyses. Through the simulation of sequencing data, seven commonly used tools were analyzed in their ability to reconstruct ancient DNA sequences through read merging. The analyzed tools exhibit notable differences in their abilities to correct sequence errors and identify the correct read overlap, but the most substantial difference is observed in their ability to calculate quality scores for merged bases. Selecting the most appropriate tool for a given project depends on several factors, although some tools such as fastp have some shortcomings, whereas others like leeHom outperform the other tools in most aspects. While the choice of tool did not result in a measurable difference when analyzing population genetics using principal component analysis, it is important to note that downstream analyses that rely on quality scores can be significantly impacted by the choice of tool.\nContextualizing protein representations using deep learning on protein networks and single-cell data\nAuthors: Li, M. M.; Huang, Y.; Sumathipala, M.; Liang, M. Q.; Valdeolivas, A.; Ananthakrishnan, A. N.; Liao, K.; Marbach, D.; Zitnik, M.\nScore: 20.8, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549602\nUnderstanding protein function and discovering molecular therapies require deciphering the cell types in which proteins act as well as the interactions between proteins. However, modeling protein interactions across diverse biological contexts, such as tissues and cell types, remains a significant challenge for existing algorithms. We introduce PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW, a flexible geometric deep learning approach that is trained on contextualized protein interaction networks to generate context-aware protein representations. Leveraging a human multiorgan single-cell transcriptomic atlas, PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW provides 394,760 protein representations split across 156 cell type contexts from 24 tissues and organs. PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOWs contextualized representations of proteins reflect cellular and tissue organization and PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOWs tissue representations enable zero-shot retrieval of the tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW protein representations can be adapted for downstream tasks: to enhance 3D structure-based protein representations (PD-1/PD-L1 and B7-1/CTLA-4) at cellular resolution and to study the genomic effects of drugs across cellular contexts. PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW outperforms state-of-the-art, yet context-free, models in nominating therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, and can pinpoint cell type contexts that are more predictive of therapeutic targets than context-free models (29 out of 156 cell types in rheumatoid arthritis; 13 out of 152 cell types in inflammatory bowel diseases). PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW is a network-based contextual AI model that dynamically adjusts its outputs based on biological contexts in which it operates.\nVoyager: exploratory single-cell genomics data analysis with geospatial statistics\nAuthors: Moses, L.; Einarsson, P. H.; Jackson, K. C.; Luebbert, L.; Booeshaghi, A. S.; Antonsson, S. E.; Melsted, P.; Pachter, L.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-07-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549945\nExploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) can be a powerful approach to understanding single-cell genomics datasets, but it is not yet part of standard data analysis workflows. In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data. Voyager has comprehensive tutorials demonstrating ESDA built on GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and scalability, using data from popular commercial technologies. Voyager is implemented in both R/Bioconductor and Python/PyPI, and features compatibility tests to ensure that both implementations return consistent results.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies have profiled over 100 million human cells across diseases, developmental stages, and perturbations to date. A singular view of this vast and growing expression landscape could help reveal novel associations between cell states and diseases, discover cell states in unexpected tissue contexts, and relate in vivo cells to in vitro models. However, these require a common, scalable representation of cell profiles from across the body, a general measure of their similarity, and an efficient way to query these data. Here, we present SCimilarity, a metric learning framework to learn and search a unified and interpretable representation that annotates cell types and instantaneously queries for a cell state across tens of millions of profiles. We demonstrate SCimilarity on a 22.7 million cell corpus assembled across 399 published scRNA-seq studies, showing accurate integration, annotation and querying. We experimentally validated SCimilarity by querying across tissues for a macrophage subset originally identified in interstitial lung disease, and showing that cells with similar profiles are found in other fibrotic diseases, tissues, and a 3D hydrogel system, which we then repurposed to yield this cell state in vitro. SCimilarity serves as a foundational model for single cell gene expression data and enables researchers to query for similar cellular states across the entire human body, providing a powerful tool for generating novel biological insights from the growing Human Cell Atlas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-cell RNA sequencing allows us to model cellular state dynamics and fate decisions using expression similarity or RNA velocity to reconstruct state-change trajectories. However, trajectory inference does not incorporate valuable time point information or utilize additional modalities, while methods that address these different data views cannot be combined and do not scale. Here, we present CellRank 2, a versatile and scalable framework to study cellular fate using multiview single-cell data of up to millions of cells in a unified fashion. CellRank 2 consistently recovers terminal states and fate probabilities across data modalities in human hematopoiesis and mouse endodermal development. Our framework also allows combining transitions within and across experimental time points, a feature we use to recover genes promoting medullary thymic epithelial cell formation during pharyngeal endoderm development. Moreover, we enable estimating cell-specific transcription and degradation rates from metabolic labeling data, which we apply to an intestinal organoid system to delineate differentiation trajectories and pinpoint regulatory strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Public sequencing databases contain vast amounts of biological information, yet they are largely underutilized as one cannot efficiently search them for any sequence of interest. We present kmindex, an innovative approach that can index thousands of highly complex metagenomes and perform sequence searches in a fraction of a second. The construction of the index is an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, while search times are two orders of magnitude faster. With negligible false positive rates below 0.01%, kmindex outperforms the precision of existing approaches by four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the scalability of kmindex by successfully indexing 1,393 complex marine seawater metagenome samples from the Tara Oceans project. Additionally, we introduce the publicly accessible web server &#34;Ocean Read Atlas&#34; (ORA) at https://ocean-read-atlas.mio.osupytheas.fr/, which enables real-time queries on the entire Tara Oceans dataset. The open-source kmindex software is available at https://github.com/tlemane/kmindex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3.x, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low.

        <p class="abstract">The rise of large-scale multi-species genome sequencing projects promises to shed new light on how genomes encode gene regulatory instructions. To this end, new algorithms are needed that can leverage conservation to capture regulatory elements while accounting for their evolution. Here we introduce species-aware DNA language models (LMs), which we trained on more than 800 species spanning over 500 million years of evolution. Investigating their ability to predict masked nucleotides from context, we show that DNA LMs distinguish transcription factor and RNA-binding protein motifs from background non-coding sequence. Owing to their flexibility, DNA LMs capture conserved regulatory elements over much further evolutionary distances than sequence alignment would allow. Remarkably, DNA LMs reconstruct motif instances bound in vivo better than unbound ones and account for the evolution of motif sequences and their positional constraints, showing that these models capture functional high-order sequence and evolutionary context. We further show that species-aware training yields improved sequence representations for endogenous and MPRA-based gene expression prediction, as well as motif discovery. Collectively, these results demonstrate that species-aware DNA language models are a powerful, flexible, and scalable tool to integrate information from large compendia of highly diverged genomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A core task in single-cell data analysis is recovering the latent dimensions encoding the genetic and epigenetic landscapes inhabited by cell types and lineages. However, consensus is lacking for optimal modeling and visualization approaches. Here, we propose these landscapes are ideally modeled as Riemannian manifolds and present TopOMetry, a computational toolkit based on Laplacian-type operators to learn these manifolds. TopOMetry systematically learns and evaluates dozens of possible representations, eliminating the need to choose a single dimensional reduction method a priori. The learned visualizations preserve more original information than current PCA-based standards across single-cell and non-biological datasets. TopOMetry allows users to estimate intrinsic dimensionalities and visualize distortions with the Riemannian metric, among other challenging tasks. Illustrating its hypothesis generation power, TopOMetry suggests the existence of dozens of novel T cell subpopulations consistently found across public datasets that correspond to specific clonotypes. TopOMetry is available at https://github.com/davisidarta/topometry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advancements in high-throughput screening have enabled the exploration of rich phenotypic readouts like high-content microscopy, expediting drug target identification and mode of action studies. However, scaling these experiments to the vast space of drug or genetic manipulations poses challenges, as only a small subset of compounds show activity in screenings. Despite being widely used in various applications, machine learning methods have not shown a reliable ability to extrapolate predictions to scenarios involving unseen phenomena, specifically transforming an unseen control cell image into a desired perturbation. We present a generative model, the IMage Perturbation Autoencoder (IMPA), which predicts cellular morphological effects of chemical and genetic perturbations using untreated cells as input. IMPA learns perturbation-specific styles from generalized embeddings and generates counterfactual treatment response predictions in control cells. We demonstrate IMPA can predict morphological changes caused by small molecule perturbations on breast cancer cells. Additionally, we test IMPA on the unseen drug effect prediction task, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art generative models when compounds are structurally related to the training set. Finally, generalizability and capability to predict more subtle effects are showcased through its application to large microscopy datasets with hundreds of genetic perturbations on U2OS cells. We envision IMPA to become a valuable tool in computational microscopy for aiding phenotypic drug discovery, facilitating navigation of the perturbation space, and rational experimental design.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ancient DNA is highly degraded, resulting in very short sequences. Reads generated with modern high-throughput sequencing machines are generally longer than ancient DNA molecules, therefore the reads often contain some portion of the sequencing adaptors. It is crucial to remove those adaptors, as they can interfere with downstream analysis. Furthermore, overlapping portions when DNA has been read forward and backward (paired-end) can be merged to correct sequencing errors and improve read quality. Several tools have been developed for adapter trimming and read merging, however, no one has attempted to evaluate their accuracy and evaluate their potential impact on downstream analyses. Through the simulation of sequencing data, seven commonly used tools were analyzed in their ability to reconstruct ancient DNA sequences through read merging. The analyzed tools exhibit notable differences in their abilities to correct sequence errors and identify the correct read overlap, but the most substantial difference is observed in their ability to calculate quality scores for merged bases. Selecting the most appropriate tool for a given project depends on several factors, although some tools such as fastp have some shortcomings, whereas others like leeHom outperform the other tools in most aspects. While the choice of tool did not result in a measurable difference when analyzing population genetics using principal component analysis, it is important to note that downstream analyses that rely on quality scores can be significantly impacted by the choice of tool.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding protein function and discovering molecular therapies require deciphering the cell types in which proteins act as well as the interactions between proteins. However, modeling protein interactions across diverse biological contexts, such as tissues and cell types, remains a significant challenge for existing algorithms. We introduce PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW, a flexible geometric deep learning approach that is trained on contextualized protein interaction networks to generate context-aware protein representations. Leveraging a human multiorgan single-cell transcriptomic atlas, PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW provides 394,760 protein representations split across 156 cell type contexts from 24 tissues and organs. PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOWs contextualized representations of proteins reflect cellular and tissue organization and PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOWs tissue representations enable zero-shot retrieval of the tissue hierarchy. Pretrained PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW protein representations can be adapted for downstream tasks: to enhance 3D structure-based protein representations (PD-1/PD-L1 and B7-1/CTLA-4) at cellular resolution and to study the genomic effects of drugs across cellular contexts. PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW outperforms state-of-the-art, yet context-free, models in nominating therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, and can pinpoint cell type contexts that are more predictive of therapeutic targets than context-free models (29 out of 156 cell types in rheumatoid arthritis; 13 out of 152 cell types in inflammatory bowel diseases). PO_SCPLOWINNACLEC_SCPLOW is a network-based contextual AI model that dynamically adjusts its outputs based on biological contexts in which it operates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) can be a powerful approach to understanding single-cell genomics datasets, but it is not yet part of standard data analysis workflows. In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data. Voyager has comprehensive tutorials demonstrating ESDA built on GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and scalability, using data from popular commercial technologies. Voyager is implemented in both R/Bioconductor and Python/PyPI, and features compatibility tests to ensure that both implementations return consistent results.</p>
