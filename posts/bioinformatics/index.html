N.; Akbani, R.\nScore: 36.5, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573793\nBackgroundPrincipal component analysis (PCA), a standard approach to analysis and visualization of large datasets, is commonly used in biomedical research for detecting similarities and differences among groups of samples. We initially used conventional PCA as a tool for critical quality control of batch and trend effects in multi-omic profiling data produced by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project of the NCI. We found, however, that conventional PCA visualizations were often hard to interpret when inter-batch differences were moderate in comparison with intra-batch differences; it was also difficult to quantify batch effects objectively. We, therefore, sought enhancements to make the method more informative in those and analogous settings. ResultsWe have developed algorithms and a toolbox of enhancements to conventional PCA that improve the detection, diagnosis, and quantitation of differences between or among groups, e.g., groups of molecularly profiled biological samples. The enhancements include (i) computed group centroids; (ii) sample-dispersion rays; (iii) differential coloring of centroids, rays, and sample data points; (iii) trend trajectories; and (iv) a novel separation index (DSC) for quantitation of differences among groups. ConclusionsPCA-Plus has been our most useful single tool for analyzing, visualizing, and quantitating batch effects, trend effects, and class differences in molecular profiling data of many types: mRNA expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number. An early version of PCA-Plus has been used as the central graphical visualization in our MBatch package for near-real-time surveillance of data for analysis working groups in more than 70 TCGA, PanCancer Atlas, PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, and Genome Data Analysis Network projects of the NCI. The algorithms and software are generic, hence applicable more generally to other types of multivariate data as well. PCA-Plus is freely available in a down-loadable R package at our MBatch website.\nOptimal distance metrics for single-cell RNA-seq populations\nAuthors: Ji, Y.; Green, T.; Peidli, S.; Bahrami, M.; Liu, M.; Zappia, L.; Hrovatin, K.; Sander, C.; Theis, F.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.572833\nIn single-cell data workflows and modeling, distance metrics are commonly used in loss functions, model evaluation, and subpopulation analysis. However, these metrics behave differently depending on the source of variation, conditions and subpopulations in single-cell expression profiles due to data sparsity and high dimensionality. Thus, the metrics used for downstream tasks in this domain should be carefully selected. We establish a set of benchmarks with three evaluation measures, capturing desirable facets of absolute and relative distance behavior. Based on seven datasets using perturbation as ground truth, we evaluated 16 distance metrics applied to scRNA-seq data and demonstrated their application to three use cases. We find that linear metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) performed best across our three evaluation criteria. Therefore, we recommend the use of MSE for comparing single-cell RNA-seq populations and evaluating gene expression prediction models.\nBeyond benchmarking: towards predictive models of dataset-specific single-cell RNA-seq pipeline performance\nAuthors: Fang, C.; Selega, A.; Campbell, K. R.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.572650\nThe advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has driven significant computational methods development for all steps in the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, including filtering, normalization, and clustering. The large number of methods and their resulting parameter combinations has created a combinatorial set of possible pipelines to analyze scRNA-seq data, which leads to the obvious question: which is best? Several benchmarking studies have sought to compare methods to answer this, but frequently find variable performance depending on dataset and pipeline characteristics. Alternatively, the large number of publicly available scRNA-seq datasets along with advances in supervised machine learning raise a tantalizing possibility: could the optimal pipeline be predicted for a given dataset? Here we begin to answer this question by applying 288 scRNA-seq analysis pipelines to 86 datasets and quantifying pipeline success via a range of measures evaluating cluster purity and biological plausibility. We build supervised machine learning models to predict pipeline success given a range of dataset and pipeline characteristics. We find both that prediction performance is significantly better than random and that in many cases pipelines predicted to perform well provide clustering outputs similar to expert-annotated cell type labels. Finally, we identify characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets that correlate with strong prediction performance that could guide when such prediction models may be useful.\nNovel metagenomics analysis suggests a Vibrio species is associated with stony coral tissue loss disease\nAuthors: Heinz, J. M.; Sommer, M.; Rosales, S. M.; Lu, J.; Huebner, L. K.; Salzberg, S. L.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573916\nStony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has devastated coral reefs off the coast of Florida and continues to spread throughout the Caribbean. Although a number of bacterial taxa have consistently been associated with SCTLD, no pathogen has been definitively implicated in the etiology of SCTLD. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the prokaryotic community through 16S rRNA sequencing of healthy and infected tissues. Here, we provide a different analytical approach by applying a bioinformatics pipeline to publicly available whole genome sequencing samples of SCTLD lesions and healthy tissues from four stony coral species. To compensate for the lack of coral reference genomes, we used data from apparently healthy coral samples to approximate a host genome and healthy microbiome reference. The healthy reference reads were then used to filter the reads from diseased lesion tissue samples, and the remaining data were taxonomically classified at the DNA and protein levels. For DNA classifications, we used a pathogen identification protocol originally designed to identify pathogens in human tissue samples, and for protein classifications, we used a fast protein sequence aligner. Although these data were previously analyzed, our approach revealed unique patterns that were not identified in the previous work. We found a relatively high abundance of the Vibrio genus across diseased samples as well as a number of enriched Vibrio phages that further support the presence of this genus in diseased samples, suggesting that a member of the Vibrio genus may be involved in the visual lesion formation stage of SCTLD. Article SummaryStudies of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), a devastating coral disease, have primary used 16S rRNA sequencing approaches to identify putative pathogens. This study applied human tissue pathogen identification protocols to SCTLD whole genome DNA samples. A k-mer based filtering method for diseased samples was utilized to compensate for the lack of host reference genomes. DNA and protein level classifications revealed a relatively abundant member of the Vibrio genus associated with SCTLD across four stony coral species.\nADMET-AI: A machine learning ADMET platform for evaluation of large-scale chemical libraries\nAuthors: Swanson, K.; Walther, P.; Leitz, J.; Mukherjee, S.; Wu, J. C.; Shivnaraine, R. V.; Zou, J.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573531\nSummaryThe emergence of large chemical repositories and combinatorial chemical spaces, coupled with high-throughput docking and generative AI, have greatly expanded the chemical diversity of small molecules for drug discovery. Selecting compounds for experimental validation requires filtering these molecules based on favourable druglike properties, such as Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET). We developed ADMET-AI, a machine learning platform that provides fast and accurate ADMET predictions both as a website and as a Python package. ADMET-AI has the highest average rank on the TDC ADMET Benchmark Group leaderboard, and it is currently the fastest web-based ADMET predictor, with a 45% reduction in time compared to the next fastest ADMET web server. ADMET-AI can also be run locally with predictions for one million molecules taking just 3.1 hours. Availability and ImplementationThe ADMET-AI platform is freely available both as a web server at admet.ai.greenstonebio.com and as an open-source Python package for local batch prediction at github.com/swansonk14/admet_ai (also archived on Zenodo at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10372930). All data and models are archived on Zenodo at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10372418.\nGenomics 2 Proteins portal: A resource and discovery tool for linking genetic screening outputs to protein sequences and structures\nAuthors: Kwon, S.; Safer, J.; Nguyen, D. T.; Hoksza, D.; May, P.; Arbesfeld, J.; Rubin, A. F.; Campbell, A. J.; Burgin, A.; Iqbal, S.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573913\nRecent advances in AI-based methods have revolutionized the field of structural biology. Concomitantly, high-throughput sequencing and functional genomics technologies have enabled the detection and generation of variants at an unprecedented scale. However, efficient tools and resources are needed to link these two disparate data types - to \"map\" variants onto protein structures, to better understand how the variation causes disease and thereby design therapeutics. Here we present the Genomics 2 Proteins Portal (G2P; g2p.broadinstitute.org/): a human proteome-wide resource that maps 19,996,443 genetic variants onto 42,413 protein sequences and 77,923 structures, with a comprehensive set of structural and functional features. Additionally, the G2P portal generalizes the capability of linking genomics to proteins beyond databases by allowing users to interactively upload protein residue-wise annotations (variants, scores, etc.) as well as the protein structure to establish the connection. The portal serves as an easy-to-use discovery tool for researchers and scientists to hypothesize the structure-function relationship between natural or synthetic variations and their molecular phenotype.\nFinaleMe: Predicting DNA methylation by the fragmentation patterns of plasma cell-free DNA\nAuthors: Liu, Y.; Reed, S. C.; Lo, C.; Choudhury, A. D.; Parsons, H. A.; Stover, D. G.; Ha, G.; Gydush, G.; Rhoades, J.; Rotem, D.; Freeman, S.; Katz, D.; Bandaru, R.; Zheng, H.; Fu, H.; Adalsteinsson, V. A.; Kellis, M.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573710\nAnalysis of DNA methylation in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) reveals clinically relevant biomarkers but requires specialized protocols and sufficient input material that limits its applicability. Millions of cfDNA samples have been profiled by genomic sequencing. To maximize the gene regulation information from the existing dataset, we developed FinaleMe, a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to predict DNA methylation of cfDNA and, therefore, tissues-of-origin directly from plasma whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We validated the performance with 80 pairs of deep and shallow-coverage WGS and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.\nEukfinder: a pipeline to retrieve microbial eukaryote genomes from metagenomic sequencing data.\nAuthors: Zhao, D.; Salas-Leiva, D. E.; Williams, S. K.; Dunn, K. A.; Roger, A. J.\nScore: 43.7, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573569\nWhole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities allows us to discover the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of microbial prokaryote and eukaryote members of diverse ecosystems. Despite their importance, metagenomic studies of microbial eukaryotes lag behind those of prokaryotes, due to the difficulty in identifying and assembling high-quality eukaryotic genomes from WGS data. To address this problem, we have developed Eukfinder, a bioinformatics pipeline that recovers and assembles nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotic microbes from WGS metagenomics data. As part of its workflow, it utilizes two specialized databases to classify reads based on taxonomy which can be customized to the dataset or environment of interest. We applied Eukfinder to human gut microbiome WGS metagenomic sequencing data to recover genomes from the protistan parasite Blastocystis sp., a highly prevalent colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. We tested Eukfinder using both a series of simulated gut microbiome datasets, which included varying numbers of Blastocystis reads combined with bacterial reads and by using real metagenomic gut samples containing Blastocystis. We compared the results of Eukfinder with other published workflows. With sufficient reads, Eukfinder efficiently assembles high-quality near-complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from diverse Blastocystis subtypes from metagenomic data without the aid of a reference genome. Furthermore, with sufficient depth of sequence sampling, Eukfinder outperforms similar tools used to recover eukaryotic genomes from metagenomic data. Eukfinder will be a useful tool for reference-independent and cultivation-free study of eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental metagenomic sequencing samples. IMPORTANCERapid advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have made whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing an efficient method for de novo reconstruction of microbial genomes from samples taken from different environments. So far, thousands of new prokaryotic genomes have been characterized from strains or species that were unknown to science. However, the relatively large size and complexity of protistan genomes has, until recently, precluded the use of the WGS metagenomic approach to sample microbial eukaryotic diversity. The bioinformatics pipeline we developed, Eukfinder, can recover eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental WGS metagenomic samples. By retrieving high-quality protistan genomes from diverse metagenomic samples, we can increase numbers of reference genomes available to aid future metagenomic investigations into the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of eukaryotic microbes in the gut microbiome and a variety of other ecosystems.\nRepeatOBserver: tandem repeat visualization and centromere detection\nAuthors: Elphinstone, C.; Elphinstone, R.; Todesco, M.; Rieseberg, L.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573697\nTandem repeats can play an important role in centromere structure, subtelomeric regions, DNA methylation, recombination, and the regulation of gene activity. There is a growing need for bioinformatics tools that can visualize and explore chromosome-scale repeats. Here we present RepeatOBserver, a new tool for visualizing tandem repeats and clustered transposable elements and for identifying potential natural centromere locations, using a Fourier transform of DNA walks: https://github.com/celphin/RepeatOBserverV1. RepeatOBserver can identify a broad range of repeats (3-20, 000bp long) in genome assemblies without any a priori knowledge of repeat sequences or the need for optimizing parameters. RepeatOBserver allows for easy visualization of the positions of both perfect and imperfect repeating sequences across each chromosome. We use RepeatOBserver to compare DNA walks, repeat patterns and centromere positions across genome assemblies in a wide range of well-studied species (e.g., human, mouse-ear cress), crops, and non-model organisms (e.g., fern, yew). Analyzing 107 chromosomes with known centromere positions, we find that centromeres consistently occur in regions that have the least diversity in repeat types (i.e. one or a few repeated sequences are present in very high numbers). Taking advantage of this information, we use a genomic Shannon diversity index to predict centromere locations in several other chromosome-scale genome assemblies. The Fourier spectra produced by RepeatOBserver can help visualize historic centromere positions, potential neocentromeres, retrotransposon clusters and gene copy variation. Identification of patterns of split and inverted tandem repeats at inversion boundaries suggests that at least some chromosomal inversions or misassemblies can be predicted with RepeatOBserver. RepeatOBserver is therefore a flexible tool for comprehensive characterization of tandem repeat patterns that can be used to visualize and identify a variety of regions of interest in genome assemblies.\nProtein superfolds are characterised as frustration-free topologies: A case study of pure parallel beta-sheet topologies\nAuthors: Murata, H.; Toko, K.; Chikenji, G.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574326\nA protein superfold is a type of protein fold that is observed in at least three distinct, non-homologous protein families. Structural classification studies have revealed a limited number of prevalent superfolds alongside several infrequent occurring folds, and in alpha/beta type superfolds, the C-terminal beta-strand tends to favor the edge of the beta-sheet, while the N-terminal beta-strand is often found in the middle. The reasons behind these observations, whether they are due to evolutionary sampling bias or physical interactions, remain unclear. This article offers a physics-based explanation for these observations, specifically for pure parallel beta-sheet topologies. Our investigation is grounded in three established structural rules that are based on physical interactions. We have identified \"frustration-free topologies\" which are topologies that can satisfy all three rules simultaneously. In contrast, topologies that cannot are termed \"frustrated topologies.\" Our findings reveal that frustration-free topologies represent only a fraction of all theoretically possible patterns, these topologies strongly favor positioning the C-terminal beta-strand at the edge of the beta-sheet and the N-terminal beta-strand in the middle, and there is significant overlap between frustration-free topologies and superfolds. We also used a lattice protein model to thoroughly investigate sequence-structure relationships. Our results show that frustration-free structures are highly designable, while frustrated structures are poorly designable. These findings suggest that superfolds are highly designable due to their lack of frustration, and the preference for positioning C-terminal beta-strands at the edge of the beta-sheet is a direct result of frustration-free topologies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of sequence-structure relationships but also have significant implications for de novo protein design.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrincipal component analysis (PCA), a standard approach to analysis and visualization of large datasets, is commonly used in biomedical research for detecting similarities and differences among groups of samples. We initially used conventional PCA as a tool for critical quality control of batch and trend effects in multi-omic profiling data produced by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project of the NCI. We found, however, that conventional PCA visualizations were often hard to interpret when inter-batch differences were moderate in comparison with intra-batch differences; it was also difficult to quantify batch effects objectively. We, therefore, sought enhancements to make the method more informative in those and analogous settings.

ResultsWe have developed algorithms and a toolbox of enhancements to conventional PCA that improve the detection, diagnosis, and quantitation of differences between or among groups, e.g., groups of molecularly profiled biological samples. The enhancements include (i) computed group centroids; (ii) sample-dispersion rays; (iii) differential coloring of centroids, rays, and sample data points; (iii) trend trajectories; and (iv) a novel separation index (DSC) for quantitation of differences among groups.

ConclusionsPCA-Plus has been our most useful single tool for analyzing, visualizing, and quantitating batch effects, trend effects, and class differences in molecular profiling data of many types: mRNA expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number. An early version of PCA-Plus has been used as the central graphical visualization in our MBatch package for near-real-time surveillance of data for analysis working groups in more than 70 TCGA, PanCancer Atlas, PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, and Genome Data Analysis Network projects of the NCI. The algorithms and software are generic, hence applicable more generally to other types of multivariate data as well. PCA-Plus is freely available in a down-loadable R package at our MBatch website.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In single-cell data workflows and modeling, distance metrics are commonly used in loss functions, model evaluation, and subpopulation analysis. However, these metrics behave differently depending on the source of variation, conditions and subpopulations in single-cell expression profiles due to data sparsity and high dimensionality. Thus, the metrics used for downstream tasks in this domain should be carefully selected. We establish a set of benchmarks with three evaluation measures, capturing desirable facets of absolute and relative distance behavior. Based on seven datasets using perturbation as ground truth, we evaluated 16 distance metrics applied to scRNA-seq data and demonstrated their application to three use cases. We find that linear metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) performed best across our three evaluation criteria. Therefore, we recommend the use of MSE for comparing single-cell RNA-seq populations and evaluating gene expression prediction models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has driven significant computational methods development for all steps in the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, including filtering, normalization, and clustering. The large number of methods and their resulting parameter combinations has created a combinatorial set of possible pipelines to analyze scRNA-seq data, which leads to the obvious question: which is best? Several benchmarking studies have sought to compare methods to answer this, but frequently find variable performance depending on dataset and pipeline characteristics. Alternatively, the large number of publicly available scRNA-seq datasets along with advances in supervised machine learning raise a tantalizing possibility: could the optimal pipeline be predicted for a given dataset? Here we begin to answer this question by applying 288 scRNA-seq analysis pipelines to 86 datasets and quantifying pipeline success via a range of measures evaluating cluster purity and biological plausibility. We build supervised machine learning models to predict pipeline success given a range of dataset and pipeline characteristics. We find both that prediction performance is significantly better than random and that in many cases pipelines predicted to perform well provide clustering outputs similar to expert-annotated cell type labels. Finally, we identify characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets that correlate with strong prediction performance that could guide when such prediction models may be useful.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has devastated coral reefs off the coast of Florida and continues to spread throughout the Caribbean. Although a number of bacterial taxa have consistently been associated with SCTLD, no pathogen has been definitively implicated in the etiology of SCTLD. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the prokaryotic community through 16S rRNA sequencing of healthy and infected tissues. Here, we provide a different analytical approach by applying a bioinformatics pipeline to publicly available whole genome sequencing samples of SCTLD lesions and healthy tissues from four stony coral species. To compensate for the lack of coral reference genomes, we used data from apparently healthy coral samples to approximate a host genome and healthy microbiome reference. The healthy reference reads were then used to filter the reads from diseased lesion tissue samples, and the remaining data were taxonomically classified at the DNA and protein levels. For DNA classifications, we used a pathogen identification protocol originally designed to identify pathogens in human tissue samples, and for protein classifications, we used a fast protein sequence aligner. Although these data were previously analyzed, our approach revealed unique patterns that were not identified in the previous work. We found a relatively high abundance of the Vibrio genus across diseased samples as well as a number of enriched Vibrio phages that further support the presence of this genus in diseased samples, suggesting that a member of the Vibrio genus may be involved in the visual lesion formation stage of SCTLD.

Article SummaryStudies of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), a devastating coral disease, have primary used 16S rRNA sequencing approaches to identify putative pathogens. This study applied human tissue pathogen identification protocols to SCTLD whole genome DNA samples. A k-mer based filtering method for diseased samples was utilized to compensate for the lack of host reference genomes. DNA and protein level classifications revealed a relatively abundant member of the Vibrio genus associated with SCTLD across four stony coral species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SummaryThe emergence of large chemical repositories and combinatorial chemical spaces, coupled with high-throughput docking and generative AI, have greatly expanded the chemical diversity of small molecules for drug discovery. Selecting compounds for experimental validation requires filtering these molecules based on favourable druglike properties, such as Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET). We developed ADMET-AI, a machine learning platform that provides fast and accurate ADMET predictions both as a website and as a Python package. ADMET-AI has the highest average rank on the TDC ADMET Benchmark Group leaderboard, and it is currently the fastest web-based ADMET predictor, with a 45% reduction in time compared to the next fastest ADMET web server. ADMET-AI can also be run locally with predictions for one million molecules taking just 3.1 hours.

Availability and ImplementationThe ADMET-AI platform is freely available both as a web server at admet.ai.greenstonebio.com and as an open-source Python package for local batch prediction at github.com/swansonk14/admet_ai (also archived on Zenodo at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10372930).

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in AI-based methods have revolutionized the field of structural biology. Concomitantly, high-throughput sequencing and functional genomics technologies have enabled the detection and generation of variants at an unprecedented scale. However, efficient tools and resources are needed to link these two disparate data types - to &#34;map&#34; variants onto protein structures, to better understand how the variation causes disease and thereby design therapeutics. Here we present the Genomics 2 Proteins Portal (G2P; g2p.broadinstitute.org/): a human proteome-wide resource that maps 19,996,443 genetic variants onto 42,413 protein sequences and 77,923 structures, with a comprehensive set of structural and functional features. Additionally, the G2P portal generalizes the capability of linking genomics to proteins beyond databases by allowing users to interactively upload protein residue-wise annotations (variants, scores, etc.) as well as the protein structure to establish the connection. The portal serves as an easy-to-use discovery tool for researchers and scientists to hypothesize the structure-function relationship between natural or synthetic variations and their molecular phenotype.</p>

Millions of cfDNA samples have been profiled by genomic sequencing. To maximize the gene regulation information from the existing dataset, we developed FinaleMe, a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to predict DNA methylation of cfDNA and, therefore, tissues-of-origin directly from plasma whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We validated the performance with 80 pairs of deep and shallow-coverage WGS and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities allows us to discover the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of microbial prokaryote and eukaryote members of diverse ecosystems. Despite their importance, metagenomic studies of microbial eukaryotes lag behind those of prokaryotes, due to the difficulty in identifying and assembling high-quality eukaryotic genomes from WGS data. To address this problem, we have developed Eukfinder, a bioinformatics pipeline that recovers and assembles nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotic microbes from WGS metagenomics data. As part of its workflow, it utilizes two specialized databases to classify reads based on taxonomy which can be customized to the dataset or environment of interest. We applied Eukfinder to human gut microbiome WGS metagenomic sequencing data to recover genomes from the protistan parasite Blastocystis sp., a highly prevalent colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. We tested Eukfinder using both a series of simulated gut microbiome datasets, which included varying numbers of Blastocystis reads combined with bacterial reads and by using real metagenomic gut samples containing Blastocystis. We compared the results of Eukfinder with other published workflows. With sufficient reads, Eukfinder efficiently assembles high-quality near-complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from diverse Blastocystis subtypes from metagenomic data without the aid of a reference genome. Furthermore, with sufficient depth of sequence sampling, Eukfinder outperforms similar tools used to recover eukaryotic genomes from metagenomic data. Eukfinder will be a useful tool for reference-independent and cultivation-free study of eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental metagenomic sequencing samples.

IMPORTANCERapid advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have made whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing an efficient method for de novo reconstruction of microbial genomes from samples taken from different environments. So far, thousands of new prokaryotic genomes have been characterized from strains or species that were unknown to science. However, the relatively large size and complexity of protistan genomes has, until recently, precluded the use of the WGS metagenomic approach to sample microbial eukaryotic diversity. The bioinformatics pipeline we developed, Eukfinder, can recover eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental WGS metagenomic samples. By retrieving high-quality protistan genomes from diverse metagenomic samples, we can increase numbers of reference genomes available to aid future metagenomic investigations into the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of eukaryotic microbes in the gut microbiome and a variety of other ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tandem repeats can play an important role in centromere structure, subtelomeric regions, DNA methylation, recombination, and the regulation of gene activity. There is a growing need for bioinformatics tools that can visualize and explore chromosome-scale repeats. Here we present RepeatOBserver, a new tool for visualizing tandem repeats and clustered transposable elements and for identifying potential natural centromere locations, using a Fourier transform of DNA walks: https://github.com/celphin/RepeatOBserverV1. RepeatOBserver can identify a broad range of repeats (3-20, 000bp long) in genome assemblies without any a priori knowledge of repeat sequences or the need for optimizing parameters. RepeatOBserver allows for easy visualization of the positions of both perfect and imperfect repeating sequences across each chromosome. We use RepeatOBserver to compare DNA walks, repeat patterns and centromere positions across genome assemblies in a wide range of well-studied species (e.g., human, mouse-ear cress), crops, and non-model organisms (e.g., fern, yew). Analyzing 107 chromosomes with known centromere positions, we find that centromeres consistently occur in regions that have the least diversity in repeat types (i.e. one or a few repeated sequences are present in very high numbers). Taking advantage of this information, we use a genomic Shannon diversity index to predict centromere locations in several other chromosome-scale genome assemblies. The Fourier spectra produced by RepeatOBserver can help visualize historic centromere positions, potential neocentromeres, retrotransposon clusters and gene copy variation. Identification of patterns of split and inverted tandem repeats at inversion boundaries suggests that at least some chromosomal inversions or misassemblies can be predicted with RepeatOBserver. RepeatOBserver is therefore a flexible tool for comprehensive characterization of tandem repeat patterns that can be used to visualize and identify a variety of regions of interest in genome assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A protein superfold is a type of protein fold that is observed in at least three distinct, non-homologous protein families. Structural classification studies have revealed a limited number of prevalent superfolds alongside several infrequent occurring folds, and in alpha/beta type superfolds, the C-terminal beta-strand tends to favor the edge of the beta-sheet, while the N-terminal beta-strand is often found in the middle. The reasons behind these observations, whether they are due to evolutionary sampling bias or physical interactions, remain unclear. This article offers a physics-based explanation for these observations, specifically for pure parallel beta-sheet topologies. Our investigation is grounded in three established structural rules that are based on physical interactions. We have identified &#34;frustration-free topologies&#34; which are topologies that can satisfy all three rules simultaneously. In contrast, topologies that cannot are termed &#34;frustrated topologies.&#34; Our findings reveal that frustration-free topologies represent only a fraction of all theoretically possible patterns, these topologies strongly favor positioning the C-terminal beta-strand at the edge of the beta-sheet and the N-terminal beta-strand in the middle, and there is significant overlap between frustration-free topologies and superfolds. We also used a lattice protein model to thoroughly investigate sequence-structure relationships. Our results show that frustration-free structures are highly designable, while frustrated structures are poorly designable. These findings suggest that superfolds are highly designable due to their lack of frustration, and the preference for positioning C-terminal beta-strands at the edge of the beta-sheet is a direct result of frustration-free topologies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of sequence-structure relationships but also have significant implications for de novo protein design.</p>
