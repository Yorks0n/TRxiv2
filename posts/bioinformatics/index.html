N.; Karlson, E.; Wheelock, C.; Mathe, E. A.; Dahlin, A.; McGeachie, M. J.; Smith, R.; Lasky-Su, J. A.\nScore: 580.1, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562114\nBiological aging is a multifactorial process involving complex interactions of cellular and biochemical processes that is reflected in omic profiles. Using common clinical laboratory measures in ~30,000 individuals from the MGB-Biobank, we developed a robust, predictive biological aging phenotype, EMRAge, that balances clinical biomarkers with overall mortality risk and can be broadly recapitulated across EMRs. We then applied elastic-net regression to model EMRAge with DNA-methylation (DNAm) and multiple omics, generating DNAmEMRAge and OMICmAge, respectively. Both biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with chronic diseases and mortality that outperform current biomarkers across our discovery (MGB-ABC, n=3,451) and validation (TruDiagnostic, n=12,666) cohorts. Through the use of epigenetic biomarker proxies, OMICmAge has the unique advantage of expanding the predictive search space to include epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data while distilling this in a measure with DNAm alone, providing opportunities to identify clinically-relevant interconnections central to the aging process.\nRosace: a robust deep mutational scanning analysis framework employing position and mean-variance shrinkage\nAuthors: Rao, J.; Xin, R.; Macdonald, C.; Howard, M.; Estevam, G. O.; Yee, S. W.; Wang, M.; Fraser, J. S.; Coyote-Maestas, W.; Pimentel, H.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.562292\nDeep mutational scanning (DMS) enables functional insight into protein mutations with multiplexed measurements of thousands of genetic variants in a protein simultaneously. The small sample size of DMS renders classical statistical methods ineffective, for example, p-values cannot be correctly calibrated when treating variants independently. We propose Rosace, a Bayesian framework for analyzing growth-based deep mutational scanning data. Rosace leverages amino acid position information to increase power and control the false discovery rate by sharing information across parameters via shrinkage. To benchmark Rosace against existing methods, we developed Rosette, a simulation framework that simulates the distributional properties of DMS. Further, we show that Rosace is robust to the violation of model assumptions and is more powerful than existing tools under Rosette simulation and real data.\nProtein Language Models Uncover Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme Function in Metagenomic\nAuthors: Thurimella, K.; Mohamed, A. M. T.; Graham, D. B.; Owens, R. M.; La Rosa, S. L.; Plichta, D. R.; Bacallado, S.; Xavier, R. J.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563620\nIn metagenomics, the pool of uncharacterized microbial enzymes presents a challenge for functional annotation. Among these, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) stand out due to their pivotal roles in various biological processes related to host health and nutrition. Here, we present CAZyLingua, the first tool that harnesses protein language model embeddings to build a deep learning framework that facilitates the annotation of CAZymes in metagenomic datasets. Our benchmarking results showed on average a higher F1 score (reflecting an average of precision and recall) on the annotated genomes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Eggerthella lenta and Ruminococcus gnavus compared to the traditional sequence homology-based method in dbCAN2. We applied our tool to a paired mother/infant longitudinal dataset and revealed unannotated CAZymes linked to microbial development during infancy. When applied to metagenomic datasets derived from patients affected by fibrosis-prone diseases such as Crohns disease and IgG4-related disease, CAZyLingua uncovered CAZymes associated with disease and healthy states. In each of these metagenomic catalogs, CAZyLingua discovered new annotations that were previously overlooked by traditional sequence homology tools. Overall, the deep learning model CAZyLingua can be applied in combination with existing tools to unravel intricate CAZyme evolutionary profiles and patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of microbial metabolic dynamics.\nVIPERA: Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis\nAuthors: Alvarez-Herrera, M.; Sevilla, J.; Ruiz-Rodriguez, P.; Vergara, A.; Vila, J.; Cano-Jimenez, P.; Gonzalez-Candelas, F.; Comas, I.; Coscolla, M.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.561010\nViral mutations within patients nurture the adaptive potential of SARS-CoV-2 during chronic infections, which are a potential source of variants of concern. However, there is no integrated framework for the evolutionary analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 serial samples. Herein we describe VIPERA (Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis), a new software that integrates the evaluation of the intra-patient ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the analysis of evolutionary trajectories of serial sequences from the same viral infection. We have validated it using positive and negative control datasets and have successfully applied it to a new case, thus enabling an easy and automatic analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 sequences.\nPyTME (Python Template Matching Engine): A fast, flexible, and multi-purpose template matching library for cryogenic electron microscopy data\nAuthors: Maurer, V. J.; Siggel, M.; Kosinski, J.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563472\nCryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a key method in structural and cell biology. Analysis of cryo-EM images requires interpretation of noisy, low-resolution densities which relies on identifying the most probable orientation of macromolecules in a target using template matching. Many method-specific template matching software exist for single-particle cryo-EM, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), or fitting atomic structures into averaged 3D maps of macromolecules. Here, we report the Python Template Matching Engine (pyTME), a software engine that consolidates method-specific template matching problems. The underlying library provides highly efficient template-matching implementation and abstract data structures for storing and manipulating input and output data. It scales favorable to large datasets, both with multiple CPUs and GPUs, compared to existing software enabling template matching of even unbinned cryo-ET data in hours, which was previously nearly impossible due to technical restraints. Any hardware-specific optimization needed for dealing with large data is automatically performed to increase ease of use and minimize user intervention. The efficiency and simplicity of pyTME will enable high throughput mining of a variety of cryo-EM and ET datasets in the future.\nBack to sequences: find the origin of kmers\nAuthors: Baire, A.; Peterlongo, P.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564040\nA vast majority of bioinformatics tools dedicated to the treatment of raw sequencing data heavily use the concept of kmers. This enables us to reduce the data redundancy (and thus the memory pressure), to discard sequencing errors, and to dispose of objects of fixed size that can be manipulated and easily compared to others. A drawback is that the link between each kmer and the original set of sequences it belongs to is generally lost. Given the volume of data considered in this context, finding back this association is costly. In this work, we present ''back_to_sequences'', a simple tool designed to index a set of kmers of interests, and to stream a set of sequences, extracting those containing at least one of the indexed kmer. In addition, the number of occurrences of kmers in the sequences is provided. Our results show that back_to_sequences streams ~200 short read per millisecond, enabling to search kmers in hundreds of millions of reads in a matter of a few minutes.\nCartography of the developability landscapes of native and human-engineered antibodies\nAuthors: Bashour, H.; Smorodina, E.; Pariset, M.; Zhong, J.; Akbar, R.; Chernigovskaya, M.; Le Quy, K.; Snapkov, I.; Rawat, P.; Krawczyk, K.; Sandve, G. K.; Gutierrez-Marcos, J.; Nakhaee-Zadeh Gutierrez, D.; Andersen, J. T.; Greiff, V.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.563958\nDesigning effective monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics face a significant challenge known as \"developability\", which reflects an antibody's ability to progress through development stages based on its physicochemical properties. While natural antibody repertoires may provide valuable guidance for antibody selection, we lack a comprehensive understanding of natural developability parameter (DP) plasticity (redundancy, predictability, sensitivity) and how the DP landscapes of human-engineered and natural antibodies relate to one another. These knowledge gaps hinder fundamental developability profile cartography. To chart natural and engineered DP landscapes, we computed 40 sequence- and 46 structure-based DPs of over two million native and human-engineered single-chain antibody sequences. We found lower redundancy among structure-based compared to sequence-based DPs. Sequence DP sensitivity to single amino acid substitutions varied by antibody region and DPs, and structure DP values varied across the conformational ensemble of antibody structures. Sequence DPs were more predictable than structure-based ones across different machine learning (ML) tasks and embeddings, indicating a constrained sequence-based design space. Human-engineered antibodies were localized within the developability and sequence landscapes of natural antibodies, suggesting that human-engineered antibodies explore mere subspaces of the natural one. Our work charts a roadmap to evaluate the plasticity of antibody developability, providing a more rational perspective for therapeutic mAb design.\nAutomated Bioinformatics Analysis via AutoBA\nAuthors: Zhou, J.; Zhang, B.; Chen, X.; Li, H.; Xu, X.; Chen, S.; Gao, X.\nScore: 26.5, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556814\nWith the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined and adaptable tools to handle the bioinformatics analysis continues to grow. In response to this need, we introduce Automated Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA), an autonomous AI agent designed explicitly for regular omics data analysis based on large language models. AutoBA simplifies the analytical process by requiring minimal user input while delivering detailed step-by-step plans for various bioinformatics tasks. Through rigorous validation by expert bioinformaticians, AutoBAs robustness and adaptability are affirmed across a diverse range of omics analysis cases, including whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES), chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics and so on. AutoBAs unique capacity to self-design analysis processes based on input data variations further underscores its versatility. Compared with online bioinformatic services, AutoBA offers five LLM backends, with options for both online and local usage, prioritizing data security and user privacy. Moreover, different from the predefined pipeline, AutoBA has adaptability in sync with emerging bioinformatics tools. Overall, AutoBA represents an advanced and convenient tool, offering robustness and adaptability for conventional bioinformatics analysis.\nNetREm: Network Regression Embeddings reveal cell-type transcription factor coordination for gene regulation\nAuthors: Khullar, S.; Huang, X.; Ramesh, R.; Svaren, J.; Wang, D.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563769\nTranscription factor (TF) coordination plays a key role in gene regulation such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and DNA co-bindings. Single-cell technologies facilitate gene expression measurement for individual cells and cell type identification, yet the connection between TF coordination and gene regulation of various cell types remains unclear. To address this, we have developed a novel computational approach, Network Regression Embedding (NetREm), to reveal cell-type TF-TF coordination activities for gene regulation. NetREm leverages network-constrained regularization using prior interaction knowledge (e.g., protein, chromatin, TF binding) to analyze single-cell gene expression data. We test NetREm by simulation data and apply it to analyze various cell types in both central and peripheral nerve systems (PNS) such as neuronal, glial, and Schwann cells as well as in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our findings uncover cell-type coordinating TFs and identify new TF-target gene candidate links. We also validate our top predictions using Cut\u0026Run and knockout loss-of-function expression data in rat and mouse models and compare with additional functional genomic data including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to link genetic variants to TF coordination. NetREm is open-source available at https://github.com/SaniyaKhullar/NetREm.\nAssessing the limits of zero-shot foundation models in single-cell biology\nAuthors: Kedzierska, K. Z.; Crawford, L.; Amini, A. P.; Lu, A. X.\nScore: 80.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.561085\nThe advent and success of foundation models such as GPT has sparked growing interest in their application to single-cell biology. Models like Geneformer and scGPT have emerged with the promise of serving as versatile tools for this specialized field. However, the efficacy of these models, particularly in zero-shot settings where models are not fine-tuned but used without any further training, remains an open question, especially as practical constraints require useful models to function in settings that preclude fine-tuning (e.g., discovery settings where labels are not fully known). This paper presents a rigorous evaluation of the zero-shot performance of these proposed single-cell foundation models. We assess their utility in tasks such as cell type clustering and batch effect correction, and evaluate the generality of their pretraining objectives. Our results indicate that both Geneformer and scGPT exhibit limited reliability in zero-shot settings and often underperform compared to simpler methods. These findings serve as a cautionary note for the deployment of proposed single-cell foundation models and highlight the need for more focused research to realize their potential.2\n",

        <p class="abstract">Biological aging is a multifactorial process involving complex interactions of cellular and biochemical processes that is reflected in omic profiles. Using common clinical laboratory measures in ~30,000 individuals from the MGB-Biobank, we developed a robust, predictive biological aging phenotype, EMRAge, that balances clinical biomarkers with overall mortality risk and can be broadly recapitulated across EMRs. We then applied elastic-net regression to model EMRAge with DNA-methylation (DNAm) and multiple omics, generating DNAmEMRAge and OMICmAge, respectively. Both biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with chronic diseases and mortality that outperform current biomarkers across our discovery (MGB-ABC, n=3,451) and validation (TruDiagnostic, n=12,666) cohorts. Through the use of epigenetic biomarker proxies, OMICmAge has the unique advantage of expanding the predictive search space to include epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data while distilling this in a measure with DNAm alone, providing opportunities to identify clinically-relevant interconnections central to the aging process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep mutational scanning (DMS) enables functional insight into protein mutations with multiplexed measurements of thousands of genetic variants in a protein simultaneously. The small sample size of DMS renders classical statistical methods ineffective, for example, p-values cannot be correctly calibrated when treating variants independently. We propose Rosace, a Bayesian framework for analyzing growth-based deep mutational scanning data. Rosace leverages amino acid position information to increase power and control the false discovery rate by sharing information across parameters via shrinkage. To benchmark Rosace against existing methods, we developed Rosette, a simulation framework that simulates the distributional properties of DMS. Further, we show that Rosace is robust to the violation of model assumptions and is more powerful than existing tools under Rosette simulation and real data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In metagenomics, the pool of uncharacterized microbial enzymes presents a challenge for functional annotation. Among these, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) stand out due to their pivotal roles in various biological processes related to host health and nutrition. Here, we present CAZyLingua, the first tool that harnesses protein language model embeddings to build a deep learning framework that facilitates the annotation of CAZymes in metagenomic datasets. Our benchmarking results showed on average a higher F1 score (reflecting an average of precision and recall) on the annotated genomes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Eggerthella lenta and Ruminococcus gnavus compared to the traditional sequence homology-based method in dbCAN2. We applied our tool to a paired mother/infant longitudinal dataset and revealed unannotated CAZymes linked to microbial development during infancy. When applied to metagenomic datasets derived from patients affected by fibrosis-prone diseases such as Crohns disease and IgG4-related disease, CAZyLingua uncovered CAZymes associated with disease and healthy states. In each of these metagenomic catalogs, CAZyLingua discovered new annotations that were previously overlooked by traditional sequence homology tools. Overall, the deep learning model CAZyLingua can be applied in combination with existing tools to unravel intricate CAZyme evolutionary profiles and patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of microbial metabolic dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viral mutations within patients nurture the adaptive potential of SARS-CoV-2 during chronic infections, which are a potential source of variants of concern. However, there is no integrated framework for the evolutionary analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 serial samples. Herein we describe VIPERA (Viral Intra-Patient Evolution Reporting and Analysis), a new software that integrates the evaluation of the intra-patient ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the analysis of evolutionary trajectories of serial sequences from the same viral infection. We have validated it using positive and negative control datasets and have successfully applied it to a new case, thus enabling an easy and automatic analysis of intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 sequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a key method in structural and cell biology. Analysis of cryo-EM images requires interpretation of noisy, low-resolution densities which relies on identifying the most probable orientation of macromolecules in a target using template matching. Many method-specific template matching software exist for single-particle cryo-EM, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), or fitting atomic structures into averaged 3D maps of macromolecules. Here, we report the Python Template Matching Engine (pyTME), a software engine that consolidates method-specific template matching problems. The underlying library provides highly efficient template-matching implementation and abstract data structures for storing and manipulating input and output data. It scales favorable to large datasets, both with multiple CPUs and GPUs, compared to existing software enabling template matching of even unbinned cryo-ET data in hours, which was previously nearly impossible due to technical restraints. Any hardware-specific optimization needed for dealing with large data is automatically performed to increase ease of use and minimize user intervention. The efficiency and simplicity of pyTME will enable high throughput mining of a variety of cryo-EM and ET datasets in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A vast majority of bioinformatics tools dedicated to the treatment of raw sequencing data heavily use the concept of kmers. This enables us to reduce the data redundancy (and thus the memory pressure), to discard sequencing errors, and to dispose of objects of fixed size that can be manipulated and easily compared to others. A drawback is that the link between each kmer and the original set of sequences it belongs to is generally lost. Given the volume of data considered in this context, finding back this association is costly. In this work, we present &#39;&#39;back_to_sequences&#39;&#39;, a simple tool designed to index a set of kmers of interests, and to stream a set of sequences, extracting those containing at least one of the indexed kmer. In addition, the number of occurrences of kmers in the sequences is provided. Our results show that back_to_sequences streams ~200 short read per millisecond, enabling to search kmers in hundreds of millions of reads in a matter of a few minutes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Designing effective monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics face a significant challenge known as &#34;developability&#34;, which reflects an antibody&#39;s ability to progress through development stages based on its physicochemical properties. While natural antibody repertoires may provide valuable guidance for antibody selection, we lack a comprehensive understanding of natural developability parameter (DP) plasticity (redundancy, predictability, sensitivity) and how the DP landscapes of human-engineered and natural antibodies relate to one another. These knowledge gaps hinder fundamental developability profile cartography. To chart natural and engineered DP landscapes, we computed 40 sequence- and 46 structure-based DPs of over two million native and human-engineered single-chain antibody sequences. We found lower redundancy among structure-based compared to sequence-based DPs. Sequence DP sensitivity to single amino acid substitutions varied by antibody region and DPs, and structure DP values varied across the conformational ensemble of antibody structures. Sequence DPs were more predictable than structure-based ones across different machine learning (ML) tasks and embeddings, indicating a constrained sequence-based design space. Human-engineered antibodies were localized within the developability and sequence landscapes of natural antibodies, suggesting that human-engineered antibodies explore mere subspaces of the natural one. Our work charts a roadmap to evaluate the plasticity of antibody developability, providing a more rational perspective for therapeutic mAb design.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined and adaptable tools to handle the bioinformatics analysis continues to grow. In response to this need, we introduce Automated Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA), an autonomous AI agent designed explicitly for regular omics data analysis based on large language models. AutoBA simplifies the analytical process by requiring minimal user input while delivering detailed step-by-step plans for various bioinformatics tasks. Through rigorous validation by expert bioinformaticians, AutoBAs robustness and adaptability are affirmed across a diverse range of omics analysis cases, including whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES), chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics and so on. AutoBAs unique capacity to self-design analysis processes based on input data variations further underscores its versatility. Compared with online bioinformatic services, AutoBA offers five LLM backends, with options for both online and local usage, prioritizing data security and user privacy. Moreover, different from the predefined pipeline, AutoBA has adaptability in sync with emerging bioinformatics tools. Overall, AutoBA represents an advanced and convenient tool, offering robustness and adaptability for conventional bioinformatics analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transcription factor (TF) coordination plays a key role in gene regulation such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and DNA co-bindings. Single-cell technologies facilitate gene expression measurement for individual cells and cell type identification, yet the connection between TF coordination and gene regulation of various cell types remains unclear. To address this, we have developed a novel computational approach, Network Regression Embedding (NetREm), to reveal cell-type TF-TF coordination activities for gene regulation. NetREm leverages network-constrained regularization using prior interaction knowledge (e.g., protein, chromatin, TF binding) to analyze single-cell gene expression data. We test NetREm by simulation data and apply it to analyze various cell types in both central and peripheral nerve systems (PNS) such as neuronal, glial, and Schwann cells as well as in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our findings uncover cell-type coordinating TFs and identify new TF-target gene candidate links. We also validate our top predictions using Cut&amp;Run and knockout loss-of-function expression data in rat and mouse models and compare with additional functional genomic data including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to link genetic variants to TF coordination. NetREm is open-source available at https://github.com/SaniyaKhullar/NetREm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The advent and success of foundation models such as GPT has sparked growing interest in their application to single-cell biology. Models like Geneformer and scGPT have emerged with the promise of serving as versatile tools for this specialized field. However, the efficacy of these models, particularly in zero-shot settings where models are not fine-tuned but used without any further training, remains an open question, especially as practical constraints require useful models to function in settings that preclude fine-tuning (e.g., discovery settings where labels are not fully known). This paper presents a rigorous evaluation of the zero-shot performance of these proposed single-cell foundation models. We assess their utility in tasks such as cell type clustering and batch effect correction, and evaluate the generality of their pretraining objectives. Our results indicate that both Geneformer and scGPT exhibit limited reliability in zero-shot settings and often underperform compared to simpler methods. These findings serve as a cautionary note for the deployment of proposed single-cell foundation models and highlight the need for more focused research to realize their potential.2</p>
