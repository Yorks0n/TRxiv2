N.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23291102\nPost-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long COVID, is globally estimated to have affected up to 40-50% of individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The causes of PASC are being investigated, and there are no established therapies. One of the leading hypotheses for the cause of PASC is the persistent activation of innate immune cells with increased systemic inflammation. Naltrexone is a medication with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that has been used in other conditions that overlap with PASC. In this study we performed retrospective review of a clinical cohort of 59 patients at a single academic center who received low-dose naltrexone (LDN) off-label as a potential therapeutic intervention for PASC. The use of LDN was associated with improved clinical symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, post exertional malaise/PEM, unrefreshing sleep, sleep pattern, and headache), fewer number of symptoms, and better functional status. This observational finding warrants further testing in rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Highlights- The off-label use of low-dose naltrexone is a promising drug intervention candidate for the management of post-COVID conditions. - Low-dose naltrexone has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may benefit those with PASC where persistent inflammation is the causative pathway. - This potential benefit of LDN warrants further testing in rigorous randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\nRefining the impact of genetic evidence on clinical success\nAuthors: Minikel, E. V.; Painter, J. L.; Dong, C. C.; Nelson, M. R.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291765\nThe cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure, with just [~]10% of clinical programs eventually receiving approval. We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. Relative success (RS) between drug mechanisms with genetic support and those without varies significantly among therapy areas and development phases and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene. RS is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency, or year of discovery. Our findings suggest that we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drug therapies.\nPreclinical and Human Phase 1 Studies of Aerosolized Hydroxychloroquine: Implications for Antiviral COVID-19 Therapy\nAuthors: Bentur, O. S.; Hutt, R.; Brassil, D.; Krieger, A. C.; Backman, P.; Charous, B. L.; Boushey, H.; Gonda, I.; Coller, B. S.; MacArthur, R. B.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291702\nBased on early reports of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQS) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro, and since severe pulmonary involvement is the major cause of COVID-19 mortality, we assessed the safety and efficacy of aerosolized HCQS (aHCQS) therapy in animals and humans. In a Phase 1 study of aHCQS in healthy volunteers, doses up to 50 mg were well tolerated and estimated epithelial lining fluid concentrations immediately after inhalation (\u003e2,000 uM) exceeded the in vitro concentrations needed for suppression of viral replication (\u003e=119 uM). A study in rats comparing HCQS solution administered orally (13.3 mg/kg) and by intratracheal installation (IT 0.18 mg/kg, \u003c5% of oral dose) demonstrated that at 2 minutes, IT administration was associated with 5X higher mean hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) concentrations in the lung (IT: 49.5 +/- 6.5 ug HCQ/g tissue, oral: 9.9 +/- 3.4; p\u003c0.01). A subsequent study of IT and intranasal HCQS in the Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, failed to show clinical benefit. We conclude that aHCQS alone is unlikely to be effective for COVID-19, but based on our aHCQS pharmacokinetics and current viral entry data, adding oral HCQS to aHCQS, along with a transmembrane protease inhibitor, may improve efficacy.\n",

A study in rats comparing HCQS solution administered orally (13.3 mg/kg) and by intratracheal installation (IT 0.18 mg/kg, &lt;5% of oral dose) demonstrated that at 2 minutes, IT administration was associated with 5X higher mean hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) concentrations in the lung (IT: 49.5 &#43;/- 6.5 ug HCQ/g tissue, oral: 9.9 &#43;/- 3.4; p&lt;0.01). A subsequent study of IT and intranasal HCQS in the Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, failed to show clinical benefit. We conclude that aHCQS alone is unlikely to be effective for COVID-19, but based on our aHCQS pharmacokinetics and current viral entry data, adding oral HCQS to aHCQS, along with a transmembrane protease inhibitor, may improve efficacy.</p>
