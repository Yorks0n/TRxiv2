N.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23291102\nPost-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long COVID, is globally estimated to have affected up to 40-50% of individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The causes of PASC are being investigated, and there are no established therapies. One of the leading hypotheses for the cause of PASC is the persistent activation of innate immune cells with increased systemic inflammation. Naltrexone is a medication with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that has been used in other conditions that overlap with PASC. In this study we performed retrospective review of a clinical cohort of 59 patients at a single academic center who received low-dose naltrexone (LDN) off-label as a potential therapeutic intervention for PASC. The use of LDN was associated with improved clinical symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, post exertional malaise/PEM, unrefreshing sleep, sleep pattern, and headache), fewer number of symptoms, and better functional status. This observational finding warrants further testing in rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Highlights- The off-label use of low-dose naltrexone is a promising drug intervention candidate for the management of post-COVID conditions. - Low-dose naltrexone has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may benefit those with PASC where persistent inflammation is the causative pathway. - This potential benefit of LDN warrants further testing in rigorous randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.\nExplainable drug side effect prediction via biologically informed graph neural network\nAuthors: Huang, T.; Lin, K.-H.; Vieira, R. M.; Soares, J. C.; Jiang, X.; Kim, Y.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-06-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.26.23290615\nEarly detection of potential side effects (SE) is a critical and challenging task for drug discovery and patient care. In-vitro or in-vivo approach to detect potential SEs is not scalable for many drug candidates during the preclinical stage. Recent advances in explainable machine learning may facilitate detecting potential SEs of new drugs before market release and elucidating the critical mechanism of biological actions. Here, we leverage multi-modal interactions among molecules to develop a biologically informed graph-based SE prediction model, called HHAN-DSI. HHAN-DSI predicted frequent and even uncommon SEs of the unseen drug with higher or comparable accuracy against benchmark methods. When applying HHAN-DSI to the central nervous system, the organs with the largest number of SEs, the model revealed diverse psychiatric medications previously unknown but probable SEs, together with the potential mechanisms of actions through a network of genes, biological functions, drugs, and SEs.\nEVALUATION OF THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF EXOGENOUS KETOSIS INDUCED BY ORALLY ADMINISTERED FREE BETA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE IN HEALTHY ADULT SUBJECTS\nAuthors: Pimentel-Suarez, L. I.; Soto-Mota, L. A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.23291298\nBeta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) is a metabolite with intrinsic signalling activity that has gained attention as a potentially clinically useful supplement. There are available supplements for inducing ketosis: ketone salts, ketone esters, and medium-chain triglycerides. Even when all of them raise the beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood and all are safe and well tolerated, they significantly differ in their safety profile, their palatability, and their price. A fourth and potentially interesting option is to use biologically identical beta-hydroxybutyrate, while it is already commercially available in the United States (American Ketone LLC) and Greater China (MedPHA Ltd). However, its safety and tolerability had not yet been documented in the scientific literature. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of orally administered Free D-BHB in a gender and age-balanced sample of 24 asymptomatic and overtly healthy adults. No participant showed acid-base abnormalities or electrolyte abnormalities. Secondary symptoms were reported after only 6.2% of all drink takes and none of the reports described the symptom as \"severe\". The most frequently reported secondary effects (19/720 or 2.6%) were gastrointestinal discomfort, headache (7/720 or 1%), and loss of appetite (7/720 or 1%). No correlation between weight-adjusted dose and frequency of secondary symptoms was observed. Free D-BHB was a safe and well-tolerated intervention for inducing sustained exogenous ketosis. Being bio-identical, salt-free, and lacking intermediate metabolites, this form of supplementation could have a larger safety spectrum than salt or alcohol-based exogenous ketones. More research is warranted to assess its clinical efficacy in those clinical scenarios in which achieving ketosis rapidly could be beneficial. KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- Ketogenic supplements could be useful therapeutic tools in certain time-sensitive circumstances. A previously unexplored but attractive option is using bio-identical D-BHB. What this study adds- Diluted Free D-BHB is a safe and well-tolerated intervention for inducing sustained exogenous ketosis. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy- Being bio-identical, salt-free, further research is warranted on the potential clinical uses of Free-BHB.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) is a metabolite with intrinsic signalling activity that has gained attention as a potentially clinically useful supplement. There are available supplements for inducing ketosis: ketone salts, ketone esters, and medium-chain triglycerides. Even when all of them raise the beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood and all are safe and well tolerated, they significantly differ in their safety profile, their palatability, and their price. A fourth and potentially interesting option is to use biologically identical beta-hydroxybutyrate, while it is already commercially available in the United States (American Ketone LLC) and Greater China (MedPHA Ltd). However, its safety and tolerability had not yet been documented in the scientific literature. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of orally administered Free D-BHB in a gender and age-balanced sample of 24 asymptomatic and overtly healthy adults. No participant showed acid-base abnormalities or electrolyte abnormalities. Secondary symptoms were reported after only 6.2% of all drink takes and none of the reports described the symptom as &#34;severe&#34;. The most frequently reported secondary effects (19/720 or 2.6%) were gastrointestinal discomfort, headache (7/720 or 1%), and loss of appetite (7/720 or 1%). No correlation between weight-adjusted dose and frequency of secondary symptoms was observed. Free D-BHB was a safe and well-tolerated intervention for inducing sustained exogenous ketosis. Being bio-identical, salt-free, and lacking intermediate metabolites, this form of supplementation could have a larger safety spectrum than salt or alcohol-based exogenous ketones. More research is warranted to assess its clinical efficacy in those clinical scenarios in which achieving ketosis rapidly could be beneficial.

KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- Ketogenic supplements could be useful therapeutic tools in certain time-sensitive circumstances. A previously unexplored but attractive option is using bio-identical D-BHB.


What this study adds- Diluted Free D-BHB is a safe and well-tolerated intervention for inducing sustained exogenous ketosis.


How this study might affect research, practice, or policy- Being bio-identical, salt-free, further research is warranted on the potential clinical uses of Free-BHB.</p>
