J.\nScore: 34.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562914\nFilamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins into host cells to suppress host defence responses and manipulate metabolic processes to support colonization. Understanding the evolution and molecular function of these effectors provides knowledge about pathogenesis and can suggest novel strategies to reduce damage caused by pathogens. However, effector proteins are highly variable, share weak sequence similarity and, although they can be grouped according to their structure, only a few structurally conserved effector families have been functionally characterized to date. Here, we demonstrate that Zinc-finger fold (ZiF) secreted proteins form a functionally diverse effector family in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. This family relies on the Zinc-finger motif for protein stability and is ubiquitously present, forming different effector tribes in blast fungus lineages infecting 13 different host species. Homologs of the canonical ZiF effector, AVR-Pii from rice infecting isolates, are present in multiple M. oryzae lineages, and the wheat infecting strains of the fungus, for example, possess an allele that also binds host Exo70 proteins and activates the immune receptor Pii. Furthermore, ZiF tribes vary in the host Exo70 proteins they bind, indicating functional diversification and an intricate effector/host interactome. Altogether, we uncovered a new effector family with a common protein fold that has functionally diversified in lineages of M. oryzae. This work expands our understanding of the diversity of M. oryzae effectors, the molecular basis of plant pathogenesis and may ultimately facilitate the development of new sources for pathogen resistance.\nA precise balance of TETRASPANIN1/TORNADO2 activity is required for vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Konstantinova, N.; Mor, E.; Verhelst, E.; Nolf, J.; Vereecken, K.; Wang, F.; Van Damme, D.; De Rybel, B.; Glanc, M.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562921\nThe molecular mechanisms guiding oriented cell divisions in the root vascular tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana are still poorly characterized. By overlapping bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we unveiled TETRASPANIN1 (TET1) as a putative regulator in this process. TET1 is expressed in root vascular cells and loss-of-function mutants contain fewer vascular cells files. We further generated and characterized a CRISPR deletion mutant and show, unlike previously described mutants, that the full knock out is additionally missing endodermal cells in a stochastic way. Finally, we show that HA-tagged versions of TET1 are functional in contrast to fluorescent TET1 translational fusions. Immunostaining using HA-TET1 lines complementing the mutant phenotype revealed a dual plasma membrane and intracellular localization in the root vasculature and a polar membrane localization in young cortex, endodermal and initial cells. Taken together, we show that TET1 is involved in both vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning. Our initial results pave the way for future work into deciphering its precise mode of action.\nRegulated Cleavage and Relocation of FERONIA Control Immunity in Arabidopsis Roots\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Qiang, X.; Liu, H.; Xu, F.; Wang, L.; Jiang, L.; Li, C.; Wang, B.; Luan, S.; Wu, D.; Zhou, F.; Yu, F.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562456\nPlant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity. One Sentence SummaryBacteria induces the cleavage of FER via At2-MMP to trigger a localized immunity around TZ and EZ of Arabidopsis roots.\nTransporter-mediated depletion of extracellular proline directly contributes to plant pattern-triggered immunity against a bacterial pathogen\nAuthors: Rogan, C. J.; Pang, Y.-Y.; Mathews, S. D.; Turner, S. E.; Weisberg, A. J.; Lehmann, S.; Rentsch, D.; Anderson, J. C.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562815\nPlants possess cell surface-localized immune receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate defenses that provide effective resistance against microbial pathogens. Many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) limits pathogen growth in plants is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against P. syringae. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant innate immunity. Given the important role for amino acids as nutrients for microbial growth, their depletion at sites of infection may be a broadly effective means for defense against many pathogens.\nRapid propagation of Ca2+ waves and electrical signals in a liverwort Marchantia polymorpha\nAuthors: Watanabe, K.; Hashimoto, K.; Hasegawa, K.; Shindo, H.; Kupisz, K.; Koselski, M.; Wasko, P.; Trebacz, K.; Kuchitsu, K.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562169\nIn response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, vascular plants transmit long-distance Ca2+ and electrical signals from localized stress sites to distant tissues through their vasculature. Various models have been proposed for the mechanisms underlying the long-distance signaling, primarily centered around the presence of vascular bundles. We here demonstrate that the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possesses a mechanism for propagating Ca2+ waves and electrical signals in response to wounding. The propagation velocity of these signals was approximately 1-2 mm/s, equivalent to that observed in vascular plants. Both Ca2+ waves and electrical signals were inhibited by La3+ as well as tetraethylammonium chloride, suggesting crucial importance of both Ca2+ channel(s) and K+ channel(s) in wound-induced membrane depolarization as well as the subsequent long-distance signal propagation. Simultaneous recordings of Ca2+ and electrical signals indicated a tight coupling between the dynamics of these two signaling modalities. Furthermore, molecular genetic studies revealed that a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) channel plays a central role in the propagation of both Ca2+ waves and electrical signals. Conversely, none of the three two-pore channels (TPCs) were implicated in either signal propagation. These findings shed light on the evolutionary conservation of rapid long-distance Ca2+ wave and electrical signal propagation involving GLRs in land plants, even in the absence of vascular tissue.\nMedicago truncatula SOBIR1 controls specificity in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis\nAuthors: Sarrette, B.; Luu, T.-B.; Johansson, A.; Fliegmann, J.; Pouzet, C.; Le Ru, A.; Pichereaux, C.; Rembliere, C.; Sauviac, L.; Carles, N.; Amblard, E.; Guyot, V.; Bonhomme, M.; Cullimore, J.; Gough, C.; Jacquet, C.; Pauly, N.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.561875\nMedicago truncatula Nod Factor Perception (MtNFP) is a lysin-domain Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) that plays a key role in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, and is involved in plant immunity. MtNFP also has an inactive kinase domain, suggesting that the protein is involved in different receptor complexes. Using the MtNFP pseudo-kinase domain as a bait in a Yeast two Hybrid screen, we identified M. truncatula SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 (MtSOBIR1) as a new interactor of MtNFP. We showed that an interaction between the two RLKs can occur in planta and that the kinase domain of MtSOBIR1 is active and can transphosphorylate the pseudo-kinase domain of MtNFP. Like in other plants, our data suggest a positive role of MtSOBIR1 in immunity; MtSOBIR1 could functionally complement an Atsobir1 mutant for defence activation, and a Mtsobir1 mutant was defective in pathogen-induced defence gene expression. We also showed that MtSOBIR1 has a symbiotic role with Mtsobir1 mutants showing a strong symbiotic phenotype in a plant genotype- and rhizobial strain-specific manner. The symbiotic role was apparent both at an early stage of rhizobial infection and in nodules. Together, these data suggest that, like MtNFP, MtSOBIR1 has a dual role, and can control immunity in both pathogenic and beneficial situations, with positive or negative roles, respectively.\nMultiomics-assisted characterization of rice-Yellow Stem Borer interaction provides genomic and mechanistic insights into stem borer tolerance in rice\nAuthors: CG, G.; Bangale, U.; Balija, V.; Ballichatla, S.; Potupureddi, G.; Varma, P.; Magar, N.; J, K.; M, S.; A.P., P.; Laha, G. S.; LV, S. R.; Barbadikar, K. M.; Raman, M. S.; Patel, H. K.; Maganti, S. M.; Sonti, R. V.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561791\nYellow stem borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major pest of rice in India, that can lead to 20-60% loss in rice production. Effective management of YSB infestation is challenged by the non-availability of adequate source of resistance and poor understanding of resistance mechanisms, thus necessitating studies for generating resources to breed YSB resistant rice and to understand rice-YSB interaction. In this study, by using bulk-segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) intervals in five rice chromosomes were mapped that could be associated with YSB tolerance at vegetative phase in a highly tolerant rice line named SM92. Further, multiple SNP markers that showed significant association with YSB tolerance in rice chromosomes 1, 5, 10, and 12 were developed. RNA-sequencing of the susceptible and tolerant lines revealed multiple genes present in the candidate QTL intervals to be differentially regulated upon YSB infestation. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a putative candidate gene that was predicted to encode an alpha-amylase inhibitor. Analysis of the transcriptome and metabolite profiles further revealed a possible link between phenylpropanoid metabolism and YSB tolerance. Taken together, our study provides insights on rice-YSB interaction at genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level, thereby facilitating the understanding of tolerance mechanism. Importantly, a promising breeding line and markers for YSB tolerance have been developed that can potentially aid in marker-assisted breeding of YSB resistance among elite rice cultivars. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlobal rice production is threatened by various pests, among which stem borers pose serious challenges. Hence, understanding the molecular intricacies of rice-stem borer interaction is necessary for effective pest management. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to unravel the mechanisms that might help rice combat yellow stem borer infestation, thus providing insights and scope for developing YSB tolerant rice varieties. To facilitate the latter, we developed markers that co-segregate with tolerance.\nA simplified disease resistance assay using YFP-expressing Potato Virus X in N. benthamiana reveals a cell death-independent immune function of RBA1\nAuthors: Hasegawa, K.; Timmers, T.; Chai, J.; Maekawa, T.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563110\nR (resistance) proteins, such as intracellular NLRs (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors), are integral components of the plant innate immune system. Host responses following R protein activation include the generation of reactive oxygen species, sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2+, transcriptional reprogramming and, typically, rapid host cell death at sites of pathogen infection, which together ultimately lead to pathogen growth restriction. To assess the activity of R proteins, agroinfiltration-mediated transient gene expression assays have been widely used in Nicotiana species (e.g., N. benthamiana). In these transient assays, host cell death is often chosen as an indicator of R protein activity from the host responses mentioned above, in part because of the ease of experimentation. However, the extent to which host cell death is a proxy for disease resistance signaling has long been debated, as host cell death and pathogen growth restriction can be uncoupled in several cases. To assess the disease resistance activity of R proteins, bacterial growth assays have been employed in combination with transient R gene expression in N. benthamiana. Bacterial growth assays, however, require multiple experimental procedures, including agroinfiltration, pathogen infection and bacterial counts, which hinders high-throughput studies of R gene-mediated disease resistance. Here, we report a simple plate reader-based assay to assess R gene-mediated disease resistance activity against PVX (Potato virus X) that expresses YFP (PVX-YFP). Unlike bacterial pathogens, PVX proliferation in N. benthamiana is not restricted by the intrinsic activity of the EDS1 signaling pathway as previously shown by virus-induced NbEDS1 gene silencing and as we consistently show in this study using a Nbeds1 gene knockout mutant. This feature would increase the sensitivity of the assay, allowing it to capture a weak-to-moderate disease resistance activity of R proteins, as the contribution of basal immunity to PVX via the NbEDS1 pathway is negligible. Using this assay, we show that a non-cell death-inducing mutant of the R protein of RBA1 (Response to HopBA1), which lacks 2',3'-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activity but retains NADase activity, confers PVX resistance in an EDS1 signaling pathway-dependent manner.\nMinimized dark cataplerosis of the Calvin cycle ensures prompt photosynthetic initiation in cyanobacteria\nAuthors: Tanaka, K.; Kondo, A.; Hasunuma, T.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562951\nAs primary contributors to oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria intricately regulate their metabolic pathways during the diurnal cycle to ensure survival and growth. Under dark conditions, breakdown of stored energy reserves of glycogen replenishes the intermediates, especially the downstream glycolytic metabolites necessary for photosynthetic initiation upon light irradiation. The intracellular level of the intermediates is maintained throughout the dark period. However, it remains unclear how their accumulation is maintained in the dark despite the limited availability of glycogen. Here, we showed that the metabolite accumulation stability is ensured by the low activities of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) converting enzymes, namely PEP carboxylase and pyruvate kinase, during the dark period. Overexpression of these enzymes significantly decreased the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates after dark incubation. The oxygen evolution ability simultaneously decreased in the overexpressing strains, indicating that the dark limitation of the PEP-consuming pathway facilitates photosynthetic initiation through the maintenance of glycolytic intermediates. This finding shed light on the importance of controlling cataplerotic flux during the dark for maintaining stable operation of the Calvin cycle.\nNetwork analyses reveal D clade ethylene response factors as major regulators of jasmonic acid-mediated resistance to early blight disease complex in tomato\nAuthors: Tominello-Ramirez, C.; Munoz Hoyos, L.; Oubounyt, M.; Stam, R.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562343\nResistance mechanisms to early blight disease complex (EBDC) in tomato remain obscure given its polygenic and quantitative nature. We investigated the early defense responses of Heinz 1706 tomato to EBDC using RNA-seq. We observed distinct transcriptional reprofiling upon exposure to two EBDC isolates and the PAMP chitin. Avirulent isolate CS046 (Alternaria alternata) elicited a vigorous defense response in the host, whilst the virulent isolate 1117-1 (Alternaria sect. Porri) showed subdued gene expression, suggesting a suppression of defense responses during compatible pathogenesis. We emphasize the specific roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORs (ERFs) in defense against EBDC, with a particular focus on the D clade ERFs. Co-expression network analysis revealed the principal genes in early defense responses to EBDC are secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, transcription factors, and hormone response genes. We constructed a gene regulatory network and predicted novel hub genes as putative global regulators of the defense response, including the D clade ERFs, WRKY, and NAC transcription factors. Our work highlights the failure of virulent EBDC pathogenesis to elicit hormone responses that suppress cell death. Additionally, we found a selective induction for specific ERFs that strongly influence the topology of the EBDC defense transcriptional network.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Filamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins into host cells to suppress host defence responses and manipulate metabolic processes to support colonization. Understanding the evolution and molecular function of these effectors provides knowledge about pathogenesis and can suggest novel strategies to reduce damage caused by pathogens. However, effector proteins are highly variable, share weak sequence similarity and, although they can be grouped according to their structure, only a few structurally conserved effector families have been functionally characterized to date. Here, we demonstrate that Zinc-finger fold (ZiF) secreted proteins form a functionally diverse effector family in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. This family relies on the Zinc-finger motif for protein stability and is ubiquitously present, forming different effector tribes in blast fungus lineages infecting 13 different host species. Homologs of the canonical ZiF effector, AVR-Pii from rice infecting isolates, are present in multiple M. oryzae lineages, and the wheat infecting strains of the fungus, for example, possess an allele that also binds host Exo70 proteins and activates the immune receptor Pii. Furthermore, ZiF tribes vary in the host Exo70 proteins they bind, indicating functional diversification and an intricate effector/host interactome. Altogether, we uncovered a new effector family with a common protein fold that has functionally diversified in lineages of M. oryzae. This work expands our understanding of the diversity of M. oryzae effectors, the molecular basis of plant pathogenesis and may ultimately facilitate the development of new sources for pathogen resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The molecular mechanisms guiding oriented cell divisions in the root vascular tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana are still poorly characterized. By overlapping bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we unveiled TETRASPANIN1 (TET1) as a putative regulator in this process. TET1 is expressed in root vascular cells and loss-of-function mutants contain fewer vascular cells files. We further generated and characterized a CRISPR deletion mutant and show, unlike previously described mutants, that the full knock out is additionally missing endodermal cells in a stochastic way. Finally, we show that HA-tagged versions of TET1 are functional in contrast to fluorescent TET1 translational fusions. Immunostaining using HA-TET1 lines complementing the mutant phenotype revealed a dual plasma membrane and intracellular localization in the root vasculature and a polar membrane localization in young cortex, endodermal and initial cells. Taken together, we show that TET1 is involved in both vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning. Our initial results pave the way for future work into deciphering its precise mode of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity.

One Sentence SummaryBacteria induces the cleavage of FER via At2-MMP to trigger a localized immunity around TZ and EZ of Arabidopsis roots.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants possess cell surface-localized immune receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate defenses that provide effective resistance against microbial pathogens. Many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) limits pathogen growth in plants is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against P. syringae. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant innate immunity. Given the important role for amino acids as nutrients for microbial growth, their depletion at sites of infection may be a broadly effective means for defense against many pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, vascular plants transmit long-distance Ca2&#43; and electrical signals from localized stress sites to distant tissues through their vasculature. Various models have been proposed for the mechanisms underlying the long-distance signaling, primarily centered around the presence of vascular bundles. We here demonstrate that the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possesses a mechanism for propagating Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals in response to wounding. The propagation velocity of these signals was approximately 1-2 mm/s, equivalent to that observed in vascular plants. Both Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals were inhibited by La3&#43; as well as tetraethylammonium chloride, suggesting crucial importance of both Ca2&#43; channel(s) and K&#43; channel(s) in wound-induced membrane depolarization as well as the subsequent long-distance signal propagation. Simultaneous recordings of Ca2&#43; and electrical signals indicated a tight coupling between the dynamics of these two signaling modalities. Furthermore, molecular genetic studies revealed that a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) channel plays a central role in the propagation of both Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals. Conversely, none of the three two-pore channels (TPCs) were implicated in either signal propagation. These findings shed light on the evolutionary conservation of rapid long-distance Ca2&#43; wave and electrical signal propagation involving GLRs in land plants, even in the absence of vascular tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medicago truncatula Nod Factor Perception (MtNFP) is a lysin-domain Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) that plays a key role in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, and is involved in plant immunity. MtNFP also has an inactive kinase domain, suggesting that the protein is involved in different receptor complexes. Using the MtNFP pseudo-kinase domain as a bait in a Yeast two Hybrid screen, we identified M. truncatula SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 (MtSOBIR1) as a new interactor of MtNFP. We showed that an interaction between the two RLKs can occur in planta and that the kinase domain of MtSOBIR1 is active and can transphosphorylate the pseudo-kinase domain of MtNFP. Like in other plants, our data suggest a positive role of MtSOBIR1 in immunity; MtSOBIR1 could functionally complement an Atsobir1 mutant for defence activation, and a Mtsobir1 mutant was defective in pathogen-induced defence gene expression. We also showed that MtSOBIR1 has a symbiotic role with Mtsobir1 mutants showing a strong symbiotic phenotype in a plant genotype- and rhizobial strain-specific manner. The symbiotic role was apparent both at an early stage of rhizobial infection and in nodules. Together, these data suggest that, like MtNFP, MtSOBIR1 has a dual role, and can control immunity in both pathogenic and beneficial situations, with positive or negative roles, respectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Yellow stem borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major pest of rice in India, that can lead to 20-60% loss in rice production. Effective management of YSB infestation is challenged by the non-availability of adequate source of resistance and poor understanding of resistance mechanisms, thus necessitating studies for generating resources to breed YSB resistant rice and to understand rice-YSB interaction. In this study, by using bulk-segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) intervals in five rice chromosomes were mapped that could be associated with YSB tolerance at vegetative phase in a highly tolerant rice line named SM92. Further, multiple SNP markers that showed significant association with YSB tolerance in rice chromosomes 1, 5, 10, and 12 were developed. RNA-sequencing of the susceptible and tolerant lines revealed multiple genes present in the candidate QTL intervals to be differentially regulated upon YSB infestation. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a putative candidate gene that was predicted to encode an alpha-amylase inhibitor. Analysis of the transcriptome and metabolite profiles further revealed a possible link between phenylpropanoid metabolism and YSB tolerance. Taken together, our study provides insights on rice-YSB interaction at genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level, thereby facilitating the understanding of tolerance mechanism. Importantly, a promising breeding line and markers for YSB tolerance have been developed that can potentially aid in marker-assisted breeding of YSB resistance among elite rice cultivars.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlobal rice production is threatened by various pests, among which stem borers pose serious challenges. Hence, understanding the molecular intricacies of rice-stem borer interaction is necessary for effective pest management. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to unravel the mechanisms that might help rice combat yellow stem borer infestation, thus providing insights and scope for developing YSB tolerant rice varieties. To facilitate the latter, we developed markers that co-segregate with tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">R (resistance) proteins, such as intracellular NLRs (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors), are integral components of the plant innate immune system. Host responses following R protein activation include the generation of reactive oxygen species, sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2&#43;, transcriptional reprogramming and, typically, rapid host cell death at sites of pathogen infection, which together ultimately lead to pathogen growth restriction. To assess the activity of R proteins, agroinfiltration-mediated transient gene expression assays have been widely used in Nicotiana species (e.g., N. benthamiana). In these transient assays, host cell death is often chosen as an indicator of R protein activity from the host responses mentioned above, in part because of the ease of experimentation. However, the extent to which host cell death is a proxy for disease resistance signaling has long been debated, as host cell death and pathogen growth restriction can be uncoupled in several cases. To assess the disease resistance activity of R proteins, bacterial growth assays have been employed in combination with transient R gene expression in N. benthamiana. Bacterial growth assays, however, require multiple experimental procedures, including agroinfiltration, pathogen infection and bacterial counts, which hinders high-throughput studies of R gene-mediated disease resistance. Here, we report a simple plate reader-based assay to assess R gene-mediated disease resistance activity against PVX (Potato virus X) that expresses YFP (PVX-YFP). Unlike bacterial pathogens, PVX proliferation in N. benthamiana is not restricted by the intrinsic activity of the EDS1 signaling pathway as previously shown by virus-induced NbEDS1 gene silencing and as we consistently show in this study using a Nbeds1 gene knockout mutant. This feature would increase the sensitivity of the assay, allowing it to capture a weak-to-moderate disease resistance activity of R proteins, as the contribution of basal immunity to PVX via the NbEDS1 pathway is negligible. Using this assay, we show that a non-cell death-inducing mutant of the R protein of RBA1 (Response to HopBA1), which lacks 2&#39;,3&#39;-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activity but retains NADase activity, confers PVX resistance in an EDS1 signaling pathway-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As primary contributors to oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria intricately regulate their metabolic pathways during the diurnal cycle to ensure survival and growth. Under dark conditions, breakdown of stored energy reserves of glycogen replenishes the intermediates, especially the downstream glycolytic metabolites necessary for photosynthetic initiation upon light irradiation. The intracellular level of the intermediates is maintained throughout the dark period. However, it remains unclear how their accumulation is maintained in the dark despite the limited availability of glycogen. Here, we showed that the metabolite accumulation stability is ensured by the low activities of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) converting enzymes, namely PEP carboxylase and pyruvate kinase, during the dark period. Overexpression of these enzymes significantly decreased the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates after dark incubation. The oxygen evolution ability simultaneously decreased in the overexpressing strains, indicating that the dark limitation of the PEP-consuming pathway facilitates photosynthetic initiation through the maintenance of glycolytic intermediates. This finding shed light on the importance of controlling cataplerotic flux during the dark for maintaining stable operation of the Calvin cycle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resistance mechanisms to early blight disease complex (EBDC) in tomato remain obscure given its polygenic and quantitative nature. We investigated the early defense responses of Heinz 1706 tomato to EBDC using RNA-seq. We observed distinct transcriptional reprofiling upon exposure to two EBDC isolates and the PAMP chitin. Avirulent isolate CS046 (Alternaria alternata) elicited a vigorous defense response in the host, whilst the virulent isolate 1117-1 (Alternaria sect. Porri) showed subdued gene expression, suggesting a suppression of defense responses during compatible pathogenesis. We emphasize the specific roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORs (ERFs) in defense against EBDC, with a particular focus on the D clade ERFs. Co-expression network analysis revealed the principal genes in early defense responses to EBDC are secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, transcription factors, and hormone response genes. We constructed a gene regulatory network and predicted novel hub genes as putative global regulators of the defense response, including the D clade ERFs, WRKY, and NAC transcription factors. Our work highlights the failure of virulent EBDC pathogenesis to elicit hormone responses that suppress cell death. Additionally, we found a selective induction for specific ERFs that strongly influence the topology of the EBDC defense transcriptional network.</p>
