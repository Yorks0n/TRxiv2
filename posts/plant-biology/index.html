P.\nScore: 60.9, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572070\nNucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The Cryo-EM structure of NRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.\nPlasmodesmata act as unconventional membrane contact sites regulating inter-cellular molecular exchange in plants\nAuthors: Smokvarska, M.; Perez-Sancho, J.; Glavier, M.; Sritharan, S.; Dubois, G.; Dietrich, V.; Platre, M.

Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities. In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion C_LI\nA root-specific NLR network confers resistance to plant parasitic nematodes\nAuthors: Luedke, D.; Sakai, T.; Kourelis, J.; Toghani, A.; Adachi, H.; Posbeyikian, A.; Frijters, R.; Pai, H.; Harant, A.; Ernst, K.; Ganal, M.; Verhage, A.; Wu, C.-H.; Kamoun, S.\nScore: 70.3, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571630\nNucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) confer disease resistance to a multitude of foliar and root parasites of plants. However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.\nThe activated plant NRC4 immune receptor forms a hexameric resistosome\nAuthors: Liu, F.; Yang, Z.; Wang, C.; Martin, R.; Qiao, W.; Carette, J. E.; Luan, S.; Nogales, E.; Staskawicz, B.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571367\nInnate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as \"helper\" NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with \"sensor\" NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses. One Sentence SummaryThe hexameric NRC4 resistosome mediates cell death associated with cytosolic Ca2+ influx.\nFunctional divergence shaped the network architecture of plant immune receptors\nAuthors: Huang, C.-Y.; Huang, Y.-S.; Sugihara, Y.; Wang, H.-Y.; Huang, L.-T.; Lopez-Agudelo, J.

While the sensor NLRs and downstream NRC helpers display diverse genetic compatibility, the evolution and molecular basis of the complex network structure remained elusive. Here we demonstrated that functional divergence of NRC3 variants has shaped the genetic architecture of the NLR network. Natural NRC3 variants form three allelic groups displaying distinct compatibilities with sensor NLRs. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and analyses of natural and chimeric variants identified six key amino acids involved in sensor-helper compatibility, with two residues critical for subfunctionalization. Co-functioning Rpi-blb2 and NRC3 variants showed stronger transient interactions upon effector detection, with NRC3 membrane-associated complexes forming subsequently. Our findings reveal how mutations in helper NLRs, particularly NRC3, have driven the evolution of their transient interactions with sensor NLRs, leading to subfunctionalization and contributing significantly to the complexity of the NRC network in plant immunity. TeaserHelper NLR subfunctionalization alters transient interactions with sensor NLRs, enhancing plant immune system complexity.\nUnderstanding Genome Structure Facilitates the Use of Wild Lentil Germplasm for Breeding: A Case Study with Shattering Loci\nAuthors: Cao, Z.; Socquet-Juglard, D.; Daba, K.; Vandenberg, A.; Bett, K. E.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572160\nPlant breeders are generally reluctant to cross elite crop cultivars with their wild relatives to introgress novel desirable traits due to associated negative traits such as pod shattering. This results in a genetic bottleneck that could be reduced through better understanding of the genomic locations of the gene(s) controlling this trait. We integrated information on parental genomes, pod shattering data from multiple environments, and high-density genetic linkage maps to identify pod shattering QTLs in three lentil interspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The broad-sense heritability on a multi-environment basis varied from 0.46 (in LR-70, Lens culinaris x L. odemensis) to 0.77 (in LR-68, L. orientalis x L. culinaris). Genetic linkage maps of the interspecific populations revealed reciprocal translocations of chromosomal segments that differed among the populations, and which were associated with reduced recombination. Segregation distortion was also observed for clusters of SNPs on multiple chromosomes per population, further affecting introgression. Two major QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 7, were repeatedly detected in the three populations and contain several candidate genes. These findings will be of significant value for lentil breeders to strategically access novel superior alleles while minimizing the genetic impact of pod shattering from wild parents.\nPhytochrome-dependent responsiveness to root-derived cytokinins enables coordinated elongation responses to combined light and nitrate cues.\nAuthors: Gautrat, P.; Buti, S.; Romanowski, A.; Buijs, G.; Pierik, R.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572814\nPlants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.\nLong-read sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA and genome assembly of a Solanum lycopersicum breeding line revealed active LTR retrotransposons originating from S. peruvianum L. introgressions\nAuthors: Merkulov, P. Y.; Serganova, M.; Petrov, G.; Mityukov, V.; Kirov, I. V.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572100\nTransposable elements (TEs) are a major force in the evolution of plant genomes. Differences in the transposition activities and landscapes of TEs can vary substantially, even in closely related species. Interspecific hybridization, a widely employed technique in tomato breeding, results in the creation of novel combinations of TEs from distinct species. The implications of this process for TE transposition activity have not been studied in modern cultivars. In this study, we used nanopore sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and identified two highly active Ty1/Copia LTR retrotransposon families of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), called Salsa and Ketchup. Elements of these families produce thousands of eccDNAs under controlled conditions and epigenetic stress. EccDNA sequence analysis revealed that the major parts of eccDNA produced by Ketchup and Salsa exhibited low similarity to the S. lycopersicum genomic sequence. To trace the origin of these TEs, whole-genome nanopore sequencing and de novo genome assembly were performed. We found that these TEs occurred in a tomato breeding line via interspecific introgression from S. peruvianum. Our findings collectively show that interspecific introgressions can contribute to both genetic and phenotypic diversity not only by introducing novel genetic variants, but also by importing active transposable elements from other species.\nThe Zea mays PeptideAtlas; a new maize community resource\nAuthors: van Wijk, K. J.; Leppert, T.; Sun, Z.; Guzchenko, I.; Debley, E.; Sauermann, G.; Routray, P.; Mendoza, L.; Sun, Q.; Deutsch, E. W.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572651\nWe developed the Maize PeptideAtlas resource (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/maize) to help solve questions about the maize proteome. Publicly available raw tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data for maize were collected from ProteomeXchange and reanalyzed through a uniform processing and metadata annotation pipeline. These data are from a wide range of genetic backgrounds, including the inbred lines B73 and W22, many hybrids and their respective parents. Samples were collected from field trials, controlled environmental conditions, a range of (a)biotic conditions and different tissues, cell types and subcellular fractions. The protein search space included different maize genome annotations for the B73 inbred line from MaizeGDB, UniProtKB, NCBI RefSeq and for the W22 inbred line. 445 million MS/MS spectra were searched, of which 120 million were matched to 0.37 million distinct peptides. Peptides were matched to 66.2% of the proteins (one isoform per protein coding gene) in the most recent B73 nuclear genome annotation (v5). Furthermore, most conserved plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins (NCBI RefSeq annotations) were identified. Peptides and proteins identified in the other searched B73 genome annotations will aid to improve maize genome annotation. We also illustrate high confidence detection of unique SNPs in the W22 proteome as compared to the B73 proteome. N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and three lysine acylations (K-acetyl, K-malonyl, K-hydroxybutyryl) were identified and can be inspected through a PTM viewer in PeptideAtlas. All matched MS/MS-derived peptide data are linked to spectral, technical and biological metadata. This new PeptideAtlas will be integrated with community resources including MaizeGDB at https://www.maizegdb.org/ and its JBrowse tracks.\nAn RXLR effector targets ER-Golgi interface to induce ER stress and necrotic cell death\nAuthors: Kim, J.; Kaleku, J.; Kim, H.; Kang, M.; Kang, H. J.; segonzac, c.; Woo, J.; Park, E.; Choi, D.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571945\nTo achieve successful colonization, the pathogen secretes hundreds of effectors into host cells to manipulate the hosts immune response. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying effector-induced necrotic cell death remain elusive. In this study, we identified a novel virulent RXLR effector named Pc12 from P. capsici. Pc12 induces necrosis by triggering a distinct ER stress response through its interaction with Rab13-2. Unlike conventional hypersensitive response cell death associated with effector-triggered immunity, Pc12-induced cell death does not coincide with defense gene expression. Instead, it induces the relocalization of ER-resident proteins and confines secretory proteins within the ER. Pc12 interacts with Rab13-2, exhibiting a specific affinity for the active form of Rab13-2. Thus, it mimics the conformation of the inactive state of Rab13-2, subsequently recruiting the Rab-escort protein (REP). This process results in disruptions in vesicle formation within the ER-Golgi trafficking pathway. Furthermore, the substitution of a single amino acid of Rab13-2 structurally predicted to be crucial for the Pc12 interaction decreased the interaction with Pc12 while maintaining the interaction with REP and PRA1. These findings offer valuable insights into the ER stress-triggered cell death as well as a potential strategy for enhancing resistance against pathogens.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The Cryo-EM structure of NRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities.

In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins

HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface
C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow
C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers
C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion

        <p class="abstract">Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) confer disease resistance to a multitude of foliar and root parasites of plants. However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Innate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as &#34;helper&#34; NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with &#34;sensor&#34; NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2&#43; influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses.

        <p class="abstract">In solanaceous plants, several sensor NLRs and their helper NLRs, known as NRC, form a complex network to confer immunity against pathogens. While the sensor NLRs and downstream NRC helpers display diverse genetic compatibility, the evolution and molecular basis of the complex network structure remained elusive. Here we demonstrated that functional divergence of NRC3 variants has shaped the genetic architecture of the NLR network. Natural NRC3 variants form three allelic groups displaying distinct compatibilities with sensor NLRs. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and analyses of natural and chimeric variants identified six key amino acids involved in sensor-helper compatibility, with two residues critical for subfunctionalization. Co-functioning Rpi-blb2 and NRC3 variants showed stronger transient interactions upon effector detection, with NRC3 membrane-associated complexes forming subsequently. Our findings reveal how mutations in helper NLRs, particularly NRC3, have driven the evolution of their transient interactions with sensor NLRs, leading to subfunctionalization and contributing significantly to the complexity of the NRC network in plant immunity.

        <p class="abstract">Plant breeders are generally reluctant to cross elite crop cultivars with their wild relatives to introgress novel desirable traits due to associated negative traits such as pod shattering. This results in a genetic bottleneck that could be reduced through better understanding of the genomic locations of the gene(s) controlling this trait. We integrated information on parental genomes, pod shattering data from multiple environments, and high-density genetic linkage maps to identify pod shattering QTLs in three lentil interspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The broad-sense heritability on a multi-environment basis varied from 0.46 (in LR-70, Lens culinaris x L. odemensis) to 0.77 (in LR-68, L. orientalis x L. culinaris). Genetic linkage maps of the interspecific populations revealed reciprocal translocations of chromosomal segments that differed among the populations, and which were associated with reduced recombination. Segregation distortion was also observed for clusters of SNPs on multiple chromosomes per population, further affecting introgression. Two major QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 7, were repeatedly detected in the three populations and contain several candidate genes. These findings will be of significant value for lentil breeders to strategically access novel superior alleles while minimizing the genetic impact of pod shattering from wild parents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transposable elements (TEs) are a major force in the evolution of plant genomes. Differences in the transposition activities and landscapes of TEs can vary substantially, even in closely related species. Interspecific hybridization, a widely employed technique in tomato breeding, results in the creation of novel combinations of TEs from distinct species. The implications of this process for TE transposition activity have not been studied in modern cultivars. In this study, we used nanopore sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and identified two highly active Ty1/Copia LTR retrotransposon families of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), called Salsa and Ketchup. Elements of these families produce thousands of eccDNAs under controlled conditions and epigenetic stress. EccDNA sequence analysis revealed that the major parts of eccDNA produced by Ketchup and Salsa exhibited low similarity to the S. lycopersicum genomic sequence. To trace the origin of these TEs, whole-genome nanopore sequencing and de novo genome assembly were performed. We found that these TEs occurred in a tomato breeding line via interspecific introgression from S. peruvianum. Our findings collectively show that interspecific introgressions can contribute to both genetic and phenotypic diversity not only by introducing novel genetic variants, but also by importing active transposable elements from other species.</p>

These data are from a wide range of genetic backgrounds, including the inbred lines B73 and W22, many hybrids and their respective parents. Samples were collected from field trials, controlled environmental conditions, a range of (a)biotic conditions and different tissues, cell types and subcellular fractions. The protein search space included different maize genome annotations for the B73 inbred line from MaizeGDB, UniProtKB, NCBI RefSeq and for the W22 inbred line. 445 million MS/MS spectra were searched, of which 120 million were matched to 0.37 million distinct peptides. Peptides were matched to 66.2% of the proteins (one isoform per protein coding gene) in the most recent B73 nuclear genome annotation (v5). Furthermore, most conserved plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins (NCBI RefSeq annotations) were identified. Peptides and proteins identified in the other searched B73 genome annotations will aid to improve maize genome annotation. We also illustrate high confidence detection of unique SNPs in the W22 proteome as compared to the B73 proteome. N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and three lysine acylations (K-acetyl, K-malonyl, K-hydroxybutyryl) were identified and can be inspected through a PTM viewer in PeptideAtlas. All matched MS/MS-derived peptide data are linked to spectral, technical and biological metadata. This new PeptideAtlas will be integrated with community resources including MaizeGDB at https://www.maizegdb.org/ and its JBrowse tracks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To achieve successful colonization, the pathogen secretes hundreds of effectors into host cells to manipulate the hosts immune response. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying effector-induced necrotic cell death remain elusive. In this study, we identified a novel virulent RXLR effector named Pc12 from P. capsici. Pc12 induces necrosis by triggering a distinct ER stress response through its interaction with Rab13-2. Unlike conventional hypersensitive response cell death associated with effector-triggered immunity, Pc12-induced cell death does not coincide with defense gene expression. Instead, it induces the relocalization of ER-resident proteins and confines secretory proteins within the ER. Pc12 interacts with Rab13-2, exhibiting a specific affinity for the active form of Rab13-2. Thus, it mimics the conformation of the inactive state of Rab13-2, subsequently recruiting the Rab-escort protein (REP). This process results in disruptions in vesicle formation within the ER-Golgi trafficking pathway. Furthermore, the substitution of a single amino acid of Rab13-2 structurally predicted to be crucial for the Pc12 interaction decreased the interaction with Pc12 while maintaining the interaction with REP and PRA1. These findings offer valuable insights into the ER stress-triggered cell death as well as a potential strategy for enhancing resistance against pathogens.</p>
