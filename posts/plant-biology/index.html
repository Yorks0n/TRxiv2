Here, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe oryzae and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze inositol pyrophosphates, a molecule used by plants to monitor phosphate status and regulate starvation responses. In M. oryzae, gene deletion and complementation experiments reveal that the enzymatic activity of a Nudix effector significantly contributes to pathogen virulence. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, utilized by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease. One-Sentence SummaryA family of conserved enzyme effectors from pathogenic fungi manipulate plant phosphate sensing to promote infection.\nGuanylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptorsin rapid auxin responses\nAuthors: Qi, L.; Kwiatkowski, M.; Kulich, I.; Chen, H.; Gao, Y.; Yun, P.; Li, L.; Shabala, S.; Farmer, E.; Jaworski, K.; Friml, J.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567481\nThe major developmental signal in plants, auxin is perceived by TIR1/AFB receptors. It triggers transcriptional reprogramming via well-established canonical mechanism but also elusive rapid, non-transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that TIR1/AFB receptors have, next to recently identified adenylate cyclase, also guanylate cyclase activity. Auxin perception activates independently the cAMP and cGMP production by TIR1/AFBs in vitro and increases cAMP and cGMP levels in planta with a slow and fast dynamics, respectively. Exogenous cGMP but not cAMP application induces rapid cytosolic Ca2+ transients and root growth inhibition, suggesting that TIR1/AFB-derived cGMP mediates rapid auxin responses. This unprecedented combination of adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in a hormone receptor provides a new paradigm for how a single perception mechanism can mediate a multitude of diverse downstream responses. One-Sentence SummaryTIR1/AFB auxin receptors have guanylate cyclase activity, whose product, cGMP mediates rapid non-transcriptional auxin responses.\nPhotobodies enable the phase-separation and counterbalance of opposing phytochrome B actions in PIF5 degradation and stabilization\nAuthors: Kim, R. J. A.; Fan, D.; He, J.; Kim, K.; Du, J.; Chen, M.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566724\nPhotoactivation of the plant photoreceptor and thermosensor phytochrome B (PHYB) triggers its condensation into subnuclear photobodies (PBs). However, the function of PBs remains frustratingly elusive. Here, we show that PHYB condensation enables the co-occurrence and competition of two antagonistic phase-separated signaling actions. We found that PHYB recruits PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5) to PBs and, surprisingly, that PHYB exerts opposing roles in degrading and stabilizing PIF5. Perturbing PB size by overproducing PHYB provoked a biphasic PIF5 response: while a moderate increase in PHYB enhanced PIF5 degradation, further elevating the PHYB level stabilized PIF5 by retaining more of it in enlarged PBs. Our results support a model in which PHYB condensation stabilizes PIF5 in PBs to counteract PIF5 degradation in the surrounding nucleoplasm, thereby enabling an environmentally sensitive counterbalancing mechanism to titrate nucleoplasmic PIF5 and its transcriptional output. This PB-enabled signaling mechanism provides a framework for regulating a plethora of PHYB-interacting signaling molecules in diverse plant environmental responses. We propose that this function of PBs represents a general function of biomolecular condensates to allow distinct variations of a cellular process or signaling pathway to coexist and interact to generate dynamically adjustable integrated outputs within a single subcellular space.\nAvrSr27 is a zinc-bound effector with a modular structure important for immune recognition\nAuthors: Outram, M. A.; Chen, J.; Broderick, S.; Li, Z.; Aditya, S.; Tasneem, N.; Arndell, T.; Blundell, C.; Ericsson, D. J.; Figueroa, M.; Sperschneider, J.; Dodds, P.; Williams, S. J.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567997\nStem rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp.tritici (Pgt) is a major threat for wheat production and global food security. Central to the success of Pgt is the secretion of proteinaceous effectors that promote infection and colonisation, while immunity in wheat is driven by receptor-mediated recognition of these effectors resulting in pathogen avirulence. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich effector AvrSr27, the third experimentally derived structure of a Pgt effector. The AvrSr27 structure reveals a novel {beta}-strand rich modular fold consisting of two structurally similar domains and confirms the poor prediction we obtained from the AlphaFold2-derived model. The highly prevalent cysteine residues within the protein facilitate the co-ordination of 4 zinc molecules. Utilising the structure, we show that the N-terminal domain of AvrSr27 is sufficient for immune recognition and interaction by Sr27. The 7-cys motif sequence in each AvrSr27 domain, which facilitates zinc binding, was also found in two haustorially-expressed, structurally homologous Pgt proteins. Remarkably, despite relatively low sequence identity, we show that these proteins can associate with Sr27 and trigger cell death in heterologous systems and wheat protoplasts, albeit weaker than AvrSr27. Collectively, our findings have important implications for the field embarking on bespoke engineering of immunity receptors as solutions to plant disease.\nConservation of heat stress acclimation by the inositol polyphosphate multikinase, IPMK responsible for 4/6-InsP7 production in land plants\nAuthors: Yadav, R.; Liu, G.; Rana, P.; Pullagurla, N. J.; Qiu, D.; Jessen, H. J.; Laha, D.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567642\nInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are soluble cellular messengers that integrate environmental cues to induce adaptive responses in eukaryotes. In plants, the biological functions of various PP-InsP species are poorly understood, largely due to the absence of canonical enzymes present in other eukaryotes. The recent identification of a new PP-InsP isomer with yet unknown enantiomeric identity, 4/6-InsP7 in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, further highlights the intricate PP-InsP signalling network employed by plants. The abundance of 4/6-InsP7 in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7 is the major PP-InsP species present across land plants. Our findings demonstrate that the Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homolog, AtIPK2 generates 4/6-InsP7 in vitro. Furthermore, the cellular level of 4/6-InsP7 is controlled by the two Arabidopsis IPMK isoforms, AtIPK2 and AtIPK2{beta}. Notably, the activity of these IPMK proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation in Arabidopsis. During heat stress, the expression of genes encoding various heat shock proteins controlled by the heat shock factors (HSFs) is affected in the AtIPK2-deficient plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of HSF is regulated by the AtIPK2 proteins. Our parallel investigations using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha suggest that the InsP6 kinase activity of IPMK and the role of IPMK in regulating the heat stress response are evolutionarily conserved. Collectively, our study indicates that IPMK has played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.\nDistinct mechanisms of plant immune resilience revealed by natural variation in warm temperature-modulated disease resistance among Arabidopsis accessions\nAuthors: Rossi, C. A. M.; Patel, D. N.; Castroverde, C. D. M.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.565111\nElevated temperature suppresses production of the key plant defence hormone salicylic acid (SA). Heat-mediated SA suppression and resulting plant vulnerability are due to downregulated expression of CALMODULIN BINDING PROTEIN 60-LIKE G (CBP60g) and SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1 (SARD1), which encode master regulators of plant immunity. However, previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana plants have primarily focused on the accession Columbia-0 (Col-0), while the mechanisms governing the intraspecific variation in Arabidopsis immunity under elevated temperature have remained unknown. Here we show that BASIC HELIX LOOP HELIX 059 (bHLH059), a thermosensitive SA regulator at non-stress temperatures, does not regulate immune suppression under warmer temperatures. In agreement, temperature-resilient and -sensitive Arabidopsis accessions based on disease resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 did not correlate with bHLH059 sequence polymorphisms. Instead, we found that different temperature-resilient accessions exhibit varying CBP60g and SARD1 expression profiles, potentially revealing both CBP60g/SARD1-dependent and independent mechanisms of plant immune resilience to warming temperature. Collectively, this study has unveiled the intraspecific diversity of Arabidopsis immune responses under warm temperatures. Our dissection of mechanisms underlying temperature-modulated plant immunity could aid in predicting plant responses to climate change and provide foundational knowledge for climate-resilient crop engineering.\nGenetic factors explaining anthocyanin pigmentation differences\nAuthors: Marin Recinos, M. F.; Pucker, B.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543820\nBackgroundAnthocyanins represent one of the most abundant coloration factors found in plants. Biological functions of anthocyanins range from reproduction to protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. Owing to a clearly visible phenotype of mutants, the anthocyanin biosynthesis and its sophisticated regulation have been studied in numerous plant species. Genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes are regulated by a transcription factor complex comprising MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins. ResultsA systematic comparison of anthocyanin-pigmented vs. non-pigmented varieties across flowering plant species was performed. Literature was screened for cases in which genetic factors causing anthocyanin loss were reported. Additionally, transcriptomic data sets from previous studies were reanalyzed to determine the genes most likely to be responsible for color variation based on their expression pattern. The contribution of different structural and regulatory genes to the pigmentation differences was quantified. Gene expression differences concerning transcription factors are by far the most frequent explanation for pigmentation differences observed between two varieties of the same species. Among the transcription factors in the analyzed cases, MYB genes are substantially more likely to explain pigmentation differences than bHLH or WD40 genes. ConclusionsThese findings support previous assumptions about the plasticity of transcriptional regulation and its importance for the evolution of novel coloration phenotypes. Our findings underline the particular significance of MYBs and their apparent dominant role in the specificity of the MBW complex.\nPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces defense responses in diverse maize inbred lines\nAuthors: Jaiswal, N.; Helm, M.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567553\nMany phytopathogens translocate virulence (effector) proteins into plant cells to circumvent host immune responses during infection. One such pathogen is Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which secretes at least twenty-nine effectors into host cells, of which a subset elicits host defense responses in crop plant species. However, it is unknown whether P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 activates immune responses in diverse maize inbreds. Here, we screened a diverse maize germplasm collection for effector-dependent recognition of this bacterial pathogen. As a control, we infiltrated Pseudomonas syringae DC3000(D36E), a derivative of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that lacks all endogenous effectors. In our evaluations, we observed a variety of responses to P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in maize and scored the phenotypes as either no observable response (N) or as one of three responses: weak chlorosis (WC), chlorosis (C) with minimal cell death, and hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death. Of the twenty-six maize inbreds screened, 13 were scored as N, 2 as WC, 2 as C, and 9 as HR-like cell death. Importantly, no maize line responded to P. syringae DC3000(D36E), demonstrating the responses observed are likely dependent upon recognition of one or more Pseudomonas effectors. Importantly, maize inbreds that recognize P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 accumulated detectable hydrogen peroxide as well as an increase in transcript expression of a subset of maize defense genes. Collectively, our results will likely stimulate new research aimed at identifying the cognate maize disease resistance proteins that recognize the activities of one or more bacterial effectors.\nComparative analysis of gene regulatory networks identifies conserved regulators in seed plants\nAuthors: Wulf, D.; Braeutigam, A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567877\nGene regulatory networks based on transcription factors control development and environmental responses in plants. Networks calculated by the machine learning algorithm random forest decision tree-based regression for the grasses barley, maize, wheat, Brachypodium, sorghum, and rice compared with Arabidopsis and an alga show substantial conservation. The degree of conservation depends on phylogenetic closeness. The processes, which are conserved between all species include basic cellular functions while the processes conserved in the grasses also more specific gene ontology terms. In the three species with a carbon concentration mechanism, photorespiration is partially disassociated from photosynthetic regulation. In contrast, in the C4 species, the regulation of C4 genes associates with photosynthetic regulation. The comparative analyses reveal conserved transcription factors, which control photosynthesis in seed plants but not in the alga. An analysis pipeline for the general transfer of information between the small weed Arabidopsis and the commercially relevant grasses is presented.\nAn Arabidopsis leaf expression atlas across diurnal and developmental scales\nAuthors: Vong, G.; McCarthy, K.; Claydon, W.; Davis, S. J.; Redmond, E. J.; Ezer, D.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566572\nMature plant leaves are a composite of distinct cell types, including epidermal, mesophyll and vascular cells. Notably the proportion of these cells, and the relative transcript concentrations within different cell types may change over time. While gene expression data at a single-cell level can provide cell-type specific expression values, it is often too expensive to perform this on high resolution time series. Although bulk RNA-seq can be performed in a high resolution time series, the RNA-seq in whole leaves measures the average gene expression values across all cell types in each sample. In this study, we combined single cell RNA-seq data with time-series data from whole leaves to infer an atlas of cell type-specific gene expression changes over time for Arabidopsis thaliana. We inferred how relative transcript concentrations of cell types vary across diurnal and developmental time scales. Importantly this analysis revealed three sub-groups of mesophyll cells that have distinct temporal profiles of expression. Finally, we develop tissue-specific gene networks that form a new community resource: An Arabidopsis Leaf Time-Dependent Atlas (AraLeTa), which allows users to extract gene networks that are confirmed by transcription factor binding data and specific to certain cell types, at certain times of day and certain developmental stages, which is available at: https://regulatorynet.shinyapps.io/araleta/.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Phosphate availability modulates plant immune function and regulates interactions with beneficial, phosphate-providing, microbes. Here, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe oryzae and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze inositol pyrophosphates, a molecule used by plants to monitor phosphate status and regulate starvation responses. In M. oryzae, gene deletion and complementation experiments reveal that the enzymatic activity of a Nudix effector significantly contributes to pathogen virulence. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, utilized by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease.

        <p class="abstract">The major developmental signal in plants, auxin is perceived by TIR1/AFB receptors. It triggers transcriptional reprogramming via well-established canonical mechanism but also elusive rapid, non-transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that TIR1/AFB receptors have, next to recently identified adenylate cyclase, also guanylate cyclase activity. Auxin perception activates independently the cAMP and cGMP production by TIR1/AFBs in vitro and increases cAMP and cGMP levels in planta with a slow and fast dynamics, respectively. Exogenous cGMP but not cAMP application induces rapid cytosolic Ca2&#43; transients and root growth inhibition, suggesting that TIR1/AFB-derived cGMP mediates rapid auxin responses. This unprecedented combination of adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in a hormone receptor provides a new paradigm for how a single perception mechanism can mediate a multitude of diverse downstream responses.

        <p class="abstract">Photoactivation of the plant photoreceptor and thermosensor phytochrome B (PHYB) triggers its condensation into subnuclear photobodies (PBs). However, the function of PBs remains frustratingly elusive. Here, we show that PHYB condensation enables the co-occurrence and competition of two antagonistic phase-separated signaling actions. We found that PHYB recruits PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5) to PBs and, surprisingly, that PHYB exerts opposing roles in degrading and stabilizing PIF5. Perturbing PB size by overproducing PHYB provoked a biphasic PIF5 response: while a moderate increase in PHYB enhanced PIF5 degradation, further elevating the PHYB level stabilized PIF5 by retaining more of it in enlarged PBs. Our results support a model in which PHYB condensation stabilizes PIF5 in PBs to counteract PIF5 degradation in the surrounding nucleoplasm, thereby enabling an environmentally sensitive counterbalancing mechanism to titrate nucleoplasmic PIF5 and its transcriptional output. This PB-enabled signaling mechanism provides a framework for regulating a plethora of PHYB-interacting signaling molecules in diverse plant environmental responses. We propose that this function of PBs represents a general function of biomolecular condensates to allow distinct variations of a cellular process or signaling pathway to coexist and interact to generate dynamically adjustable integrated outputs within a single subcellular space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp.tritici (Pgt) is a major threat for wheat production and global food security. Central to the success of Pgt is the secretion of proteinaceous effectors that promote infection and colonisation, while immunity in wheat is driven by receptor-mediated recognition of these effectors resulting in pathogen avirulence. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich effector AvrSr27, the third experimentally derived structure of a Pgt effector. The AvrSr27 structure reveals a novel {beta}-strand rich modular fold consisting of two structurally similar domains and confirms the poor prediction we obtained from the AlphaFold2-derived model. The highly prevalent cysteine residues within the protein facilitate the co-ordination of 4 zinc molecules. Utilising the structure, we show that the N-terminal domain of AvrSr27 is sufficient for immune recognition and interaction by Sr27. The 7-cys motif sequence in each AvrSr27 domain, which facilitates zinc binding, was also found in two haustorially-expressed, structurally homologous Pgt proteins. Remarkably, despite relatively low sequence identity, we show that these proteins can associate with Sr27 and trigger cell death in heterologous systems and wheat protoplasts, albeit weaker than AvrSr27. Collectively, our findings have important implications for the field embarking on bespoke engineering of immunity receptors as solutions to plant disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are soluble cellular messengers that integrate environmental cues to induce adaptive responses in eukaryotes. In plants, the biological functions of various PP-InsP species are poorly understood, largely due to the absence of canonical enzymes present in other eukaryotes. The recent identification of a new PP-InsP isomer with yet unknown enantiomeric identity, 4/6-InsP7 in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, further highlights the intricate PP-InsP signalling network employed by plants. The abundance of 4/6-InsP7 in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7 is the major PP-InsP species present across land plants. Our findings demonstrate that the Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homolog, AtIPK2 generates 4/6-InsP7 in vitro. Furthermore, the cellular level of 4/6-InsP7 is controlled by the two Arabidopsis IPMK isoforms, AtIPK2 and AtIPK2{beta}. Notably, the activity of these IPMK proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation in Arabidopsis. During heat stress, the expression of genes encoding various heat shock proteins controlled by the heat shock factors (HSFs) is affected in the AtIPK2-deficient plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of HSF is regulated by the AtIPK2 proteins. Our parallel investigations using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha suggest that the InsP6 kinase activity of IPMK and the role of IPMK in regulating the heat stress response are evolutionarily conserved. Collectively, our study indicates that IPMK has played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Elevated temperature suppresses production of the key plant defence hormone salicylic acid (SA). Heat-mediated SA suppression and resulting plant vulnerability are due to downregulated expression of CALMODULIN BINDING PROTEIN 60-LIKE G (CBP60g) and SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1 (SARD1), which encode master regulators of plant immunity. However, previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana plants have primarily focused on the accession Columbia-0 (Col-0), while the mechanisms governing the intraspecific variation in Arabidopsis immunity under elevated temperature have remained unknown. Here we show that BASIC HELIX LOOP HELIX 059 (bHLH059), a thermosensitive SA regulator at non-stress temperatures, does not regulate immune suppression under warmer temperatures. In agreement, temperature-resilient and -sensitive Arabidopsis accessions based on disease resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 did not correlate with bHLH059 sequence polymorphisms. Instead, we found that different temperature-resilient accessions exhibit varying CBP60g and SARD1 expression profiles, potentially revealing both CBP60g/SARD1-dependent and independent mechanisms of plant immune resilience to warming temperature. Collectively, this study has unveiled the intraspecific diversity of Arabidopsis immune responses under warm temperatures. Our dissection of mechanisms underlying temperature-modulated plant immunity could aid in predicting plant responses to climate change and provide foundational knowledge for climate-resilient crop engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnthocyanins represent one of the most abundant coloration factors found in plants. Biological functions of anthocyanins range from reproduction to protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. Owing to a clearly visible phenotype of mutants, the anthocyanin biosynthesis and its sophisticated regulation have been studied in numerous plant species. Genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes are regulated by a transcription factor complex comprising MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins.

ResultsA systematic comparison of anthocyanin-pigmented vs. non-pigmented varieties across flowering plant species was performed. Literature was screened for cases in which genetic factors causing anthocyanin loss were reported. Additionally, transcriptomic data sets from previous studies were reanalyzed to determine the genes most likely to be responsible for color variation based on their expression pattern. The contribution of different structural and regulatory genes to the pigmentation differences was quantified. Gene expression differences concerning transcription factors are by far the most frequent explanation for pigmentation differences observed between two varieties of the same species. Among the transcription factors in the analyzed cases, MYB genes are substantially more likely to explain pigmentation differences than bHLH or WD40 genes.

ConclusionsThese findings support previous assumptions about the plasticity of transcriptional regulation and its importance for the evolution of novel coloration phenotypes. Our findings underline the particular significance of MYBs and their apparent dominant role in the specificity of the MBW complex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many phytopathogens translocate virulence (effector) proteins into plant cells to circumvent host immune responses during infection. One such pathogen is Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which secretes at least twenty-nine effectors into host cells, of which a subset elicits host defense responses in crop plant species. However, it is unknown whether P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 activates immune responses in diverse maize inbreds. Here, we screened a diverse maize germplasm collection for effector-dependent recognition of this bacterial pathogen. As a control, we infiltrated Pseudomonas syringae DC3000(D36E), a derivative of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 that lacks all endogenous effectors. In our evaluations, we observed a variety of responses to P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in maize and scored the phenotypes as either no observable response (N) or as one of three responses: weak chlorosis (WC), chlorosis (C) with minimal cell death, and hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death. Of the twenty-six maize inbreds screened, 13 were scored as N, 2 as WC, 2 as C, and 9 as HR-like cell death. Importantly, no maize line responded to P. syringae DC3000(D36E), demonstrating the responses observed are likely dependent upon recognition of one or more Pseudomonas effectors. Importantly, maize inbreds that recognize P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 accumulated detectable hydrogen peroxide as well as an increase in transcript expression of a subset of maize defense genes. Collectively, our results will likely stimulate new research aimed at identifying the cognate maize disease resistance proteins that recognize the activities of one or more bacterial effectors.</p>

The processes, which are conserved between all species include basic cellular functions while the processes conserved in the grasses also more specific gene ontology terms. In the three species with a carbon concentration mechanism, photorespiration is partially disassociated from photosynthetic regulation. In contrast, in the C4 species, the regulation of C4 genes associates with photosynthetic regulation. The comparative analyses reveal conserved transcription factors, which control photosynthesis in seed plants but not in the alga. An analysis pipeline for the general transfer of information between the small weed Arabidopsis and the commercially relevant grasses is presented.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mature plant leaves are a composite of distinct cell types, including epidermal, mesophyll and vascular cells. Notably the proportion of these cells, and the relative transcript concentrations within different cell types may change over time. While gene expression data at a single-cell level can provide cell-type specific expression values, it is often too expensive to perform this on high resolution time series. Although bulk RNA-seq can be performed in a high resolution time series, the RNA-seq in whole leaves measures the average gene expression values across all cell types in each sample. In this study, we combined single cell RNA-seq data with time-series data from whole leaves to infer an atlas of cell type-specific gene expression changes over time for Arabidopsis thaliana. We inferred how relative transcript concentrations of cell types vary across diurnal and developmental time scales. Importantly this analysis revealed three sub-groups of mesophyll cells that have distinct temporal profiles of expression. Finally, we develop tissue-specific gene networks that form a new community resource: An Arabidopsis Leaf Time-Dependent Atlas (AraLeTa), which allows users to extract gene networks that are confirmed by transcription factor binding data and specific to certain cell types, at certain times of day and certain developmental stages, which is available at: https://regulatorynet.shinyapps.io/araleta/.</p>
