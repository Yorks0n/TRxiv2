W.; Kadota, Y.; Shirasu, K.\nScore: 58.9, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547604\nPlants perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate PRR-triggered immunity (PTI). Despite extensive research on PTI in model plant species, the evolutionary trajectory and emergence of PRRs remain elusive. Here we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components among 350 plant species. Our findings reveal that cell-surface receptors comprise two major classes, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs), with RLP being more ancient whereas RLK families have undergone significant expansion. We also demonstrate that multiple downstream signalling components have an ancient origin within the plant lineage. To shed light on the immune-specificity of PRRs, we traced the evolutionary origin of immune-specific leucine-rich repeat-RLPs (LRR-RLPs) in plants. Surprisingly, we discovered that the last four LRR motifs crucial for co-receptor interaction in LRR-RLPs are closely related to those of the LRR-RLK subgroup Xb, which primarily governs growth and development. Functional characterisation further reveals that LRR-RLPs initiate immune responses through their juxtamembrane and transmembrane regions, while LRR-RLK-Xb members regulate development through their cytosolic kinase domains. Our data suggest modular evolution of cell-surface receptors in which immunity- and development-specific cell-surface receptors share a common origin. After diversification, their ectodomains, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions have either diversified or stabilised to recognize ligands that activate different downstream responses. We propose that cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components are ancient, and likely predate the emergence of land plants, subsequently evolving to exhibit greater complexity and specificity within the land plant lineage.\nA RabGAP-Rab GTPase pair regulates plant autophagy and immunity\nAuthors: Yuen, E. L. H.; Leary, A. Y.; Clavel, M.; Tumtas, Y.; Mohseni, A.; Picchianti, L.; Jamshidiha, M.; Pandey, P.; Duggan, C.; Cota, E.; Dagdas, Y.; Bozkurt, T. O.\nScore: 52.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547386\nPlants rely on autophagy and membrane trafficking to tolerate stress, combat infections, and maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular interplay between autophagy and membrane trafficking is poorly understood. Using an AI-assisted approach, we identified Rab3GAP-like (Rab3GAPL) as an important membrane trafficking node that controls plant autophagy negatively. Rab3GAPL suppresses autophagy by binding to ATG8, the core autophagy adaptor, and deactivating Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for autophagosome formation and defense-related secretion. Rab3GAPL from Nicotiana benthamiana, but not its mutated form deficient in ATG8 binding, reduced autophagic flux in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, Rab3GAPL-knockout mutants of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha exhibited enhanced autophagic flux under both normal and heat stress conditions, suggesting that Rab3GAPLs negative regulatory role in autophagy is conserved in land plants. Beyond autophagy regulation, Rab3GAPL modulates focal immunity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans by preventing defense-related secretion. Altogether, our results suggest that Rab3GAPL acts as a molecular rheostat to coordinate autophagic flux and defense-related secretion by restraining Rab8a-mediated trafficking. This unprecedented interplay between a RabGAP-Rab pair and ATG8 sheds new light on the intricate membrane transport mechanisms underlying plant autophagy and immunity.\nComparisons of two receptor pathways in a single cell-type reveal features of signalling specificity.\nAuthors: Ma, Y.; Fluckiger, I.; Nicolet, J.; Pang, J.; Dickinson, J.; De Bellis, D.; Emonet, A.; Fujita, S.; Geldner, N.\nScore: 31.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547518\nTo respond appropriately to diverse stimuli, cells harbour numerous receptor pathways yet share downstream signalling components. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) cascades, present in all eukaryotes, act as central hubs shared amongst diverse signalling pathways. How signalling specificity is maintained within a single plant cell-type is not well understood. We engineered a genetic background for direct comparisons of a developmental and an immunity pathway in the Arabidopsis root endodermis. We show the two pathways maintain distinct outputs despite similar MPK phosphorylation patterns. Systematic activation of all individual MPK Kinases (MKKs) in the endodermis revealed that different MKK groups can drive distinct outputs. We propose that specificity is achieved through a balance of combinatorial activation and cross-pathway inhibition within the MPK cascade. Our findings demonstrate the ability of MPK cascades to generate diverse outputs in one plant cell-type, providing new insights into the mechanisms contributing to signalling specificity.\nA fungal pathogen manipulates phytocytokine signaling for plant infection\nAuthors: Hua, C.; Zhang, L.; Stintzi, A.; Schaller, A.; Guo, H.-S.; Nuernberger, T.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547642\nPhytocytokines are hormone-like plant peptides that modulate immune homeostasis and development. Phytosulfokine (PSK) mediates plant growth and attenuates activation of plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). We show that the small cysteine-containing effector VdSCP8 from Verticillium dahliae (Vd) is a virulence-promoting protein that suppresses PTI in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Apoplastic SCP8 suppresses immune activation through leucine-rich repeat ectodomain pattern recognition receptors. SCP8 virulence and immunosuppressive activities require PHYTOSULFOKINE RECEPTOR 1 (PSKR1), which binds PSK and forms a complex with co-receptor BAK1 for PTI suppression. We find that PSK, like SCP8, suppresses PTI, SCP8 stimulates PSKR1-BAK1 complex formation, and that Vd requires PSK signaling for host infection. SCP8 interacts with an apoplastic subtilase, and co-expression of SCP8 and subtilase inhibitors reduces PTI suppression. Our findings suggest that a multi-host plant pathogen manipulates PTI by enhancing immunosuppressive PSK signaling, likely through plant subtilase activity.\nSmall proteins modulate ion channel-like ACD6 to regulate immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Li, L.; Kim, J.; Neuhaeuser, B.; Wang, M.; Thelen, M.; Hilleary, R.; Chi, Y.; Wei, L.; Venkataramani, K.; Exposito-Alonso, M.; Liu, C.; Keck, J.; Barragan, A. C.; Schwab, R.; Lutz, U.; Pei, Z.; He, S.-Y.; Ludewig, U.; Weigel, D.; Zhu, W.\nScore: 44.1, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2021.01.25.428077\nACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) mediates a trade-off between growth and defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the precise biochemical mechanism by which ACD6 and related proteins in plants act remains enigmatic. Here, we identified two loci, MODULATOR OF HYPERACTIVE ACD6 1 (MHA1) and its paralog MHA1-LIKE (MHA1L), that code for ~7 kDa proteins that differentially interact with specific ACD6 variants. MHA1L enhances accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. ACD6 is a multipass transmembrane protein with intracellular ankyrin repeats that are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels. Several lines of evidence link increased ACD6 activity to enhanced calcium influx, likely mediated by ACD6 itself and with MHA1L as a direct regulator of ACD6.\nITPK1 regulates jasmonate-controlled root development in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Laha, D.; Pullagurla, N. J.; Shome, S.; Yadav, R.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545325\nJasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone that regulates a plethora of physiological processes including immunity and development and is perceived by the F-Box protein, Coronatine-insensitive protein 1(COI1). The discovery of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in the COI1 receptor complex highlights their role in JA perception. InsPs are phosphate-rich signaling molecules that control many aspects of plant physiology. Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are diphosphate containing InsP species of which InsP7 and InsP8 are the best characterized ones. Different InsP and PP-InsP species are linked with JA-related plant immunity. However, role of PP-InsP species in regulating JA-dependent developmental processes are poorly understood. Recent identification of ITPK1 kinase responsible for the production of 5-InsP7 from InsP6 in planta provides a platform to interrogate possible involvement of ITPK-derived InsP species in JA-related plant development. Herein this study, we report that ITPK1-defective plants exhibit increased root growth inhibition to bioactive JA treatment. The itpk1 plants also show increased lateral root density when treated with JA. Notably, JA treatment does not induce ITPK1 protein level. Gene expression analyses revealed that JA-biosynthetic genes are not differentially expressed in the ITPK1-deficient plants. We further demonstrate that genes encoding different JAZ repressor proteins are severely downregulated in the ITPK1-defective plants. Taken together, our study highlights the role of ITPK1 in regulating JA-dependent root architecture development through controlling expression of different JAZ repressor proteins.\nRNA-directed DNA Methylation is required for seed development in outbreeding species\nAuthors: Dew-Budd, K. J.; Chow, H. T.; Kendall, T.; David, B. C.; Rozelle, J. A.; Mosher, R. A.; Beilstein, M. A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547469\nIn plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulation in the maternally-derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, Brassica rapa mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these closely-related species, we produced RdDM mutations in three additional members of the Brassicaceae family: Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, and Capsella grandiflora. Among these three species, only mutations in Capsella grandiflora displayed a seed production defect similar to Brassica rapa mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.\nGrapevine bacterial communities across the Central Valley of California\nAuthors: Swift, J. F.; Migicovsky, Z.; Trello, G. E.; Miller, A. J.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547327\nPlant organs (compartments) host distinct microbiota which shift in response to variation in both development and climate. Grapevines are woody perennial crops that are clonally propagated and cultivated across vast geographic areas, and as such, their microbial communities may also reflect site-specific influences. These site-specific influences, and the microbial differences across site compose terroir, the environmental influence on wine produced in a given region. Commercial grapevines are typically composed of a genetically distinct root (rootstock) grafted to a shoot system (scion) which adds an additional layer of complexity. In order to understand spatial and temporal patterns of bacterial diversity in grafted grapevines, we used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to quantify soil and compartment microbiota (berries, leaves, and roots) for grafted grapevines in commercial vineyards across three counties in the Central Valley of California over two successive growing seasons. Community composition revealed compartment-specific dynamics. Roots assembled site-specific bacterial communities that reflect rootstock genotype and environment influences, whereas bacterial communities of leaves and berries displayed associations with time. These results provide further evidence of a microbial terroir within the grapevine root systems but also reveal that the microbiota of above-ground compartments are only weakly associated with the local microbiome in the Central Valley of California.\nStraining the root on and off triggers local calcium signaling\nAuthors: Audemar, V.; Guerringue, Y.; Frederick, J.; Melogno, I.; Vinet, P.; Babataheri, A.; Legue|, V.; Thomine, S.; Frachisse, J.-M.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-06-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.11.540308\nThroughout their life, plant root are submitted to mechanical stresses due to pressure exerted by the soil. So far, few studies addressed root cell deformation and calcium signaling elicited by soil compression. In this study, we designed a microchip inspired by pneumatic microvalve concept in order to deliver a lateral pressure to the root of a plant expressing the RGECO1-mTurquoise calcium reporter. Lateral pressure applied on the root induced a moderate elastic deformation of root cortical cells and elicited a multicomponent calcium signal at the onset of the pressure pulse, followed by a second one at the release of the pressure. This indicates that straining rather than stressing of tissues is relevant to trigger the calcium signal. The calcium elevation was restricted to the tissue under pressure and did not propagate. Additionally, the calcium signals exhibited a remarkable attenuation upon repetitive stimulations. Highlights- A microvalve concept mimicking lateral soil pressure was developed. - Non-damaging lateral compression of the root induces an elastic deformation of cortical cells. - A multicomponent calcium signal is elicited at the onset of a pressure pulse and upon release of the pressure. - Straining rather than stressing of tissues is relevant to trigger the calcium signal. - The calcium signal is localized at the tissue under pressure and does not propagate. - Calcium signals exhibit a remarkable attenuation upon repetitive stimulations.\nMapping the landscape of transcription factor promoter activity during vegetative development in Marchantia\nAuthors: Romani, F.; Sauret-Güeto, S.; Rebmann, M.; Annese, D.; Bonter, I.; Tomaselli, M.; Dierschke, T.; Delmans, M.; Frangedakis, E.; Silvestri, L.; Rever, J.; Bowman, J. L.; Romani, I.; Haseloff, J.\nScore: 52.9, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.545419\nTranscription factors (TFs) are essential for the regulation of gene expression and cell fate determination. Characterising the transcriptional activity of TF genes in space and time is a critical step towards understanding complex biological systems. The vegetative gametophyte meristems of bryophytes share some characteristics with the shoot-apical meristems of flowering plants. However, the identity and expression profiles of TFs associated with gametophyte organization are largely unknown. With only [~]450 TF genes, Marchantia polymorpha is an outstanding model system for plant systems biology. We have generated a near-complete collection of promoter elements derived from Marchantia TF genes. We experimentally tested in planta reporter fusions for all the TF promoters in the collection and systematically analysed expression patterns in Marchantia gemmae. This allowed us to build a map of precise expression domains and identify a unique set of TFs expressed in the stem-cell zone, providing new insight into the dynamic regulation of the gametophytic meristem and its evolution. In addition, we provide an online database of expression patterns for all promoters in the collection. We expect that the promoter elements characterised here will be useful for cell-type specific expression, synthetic biology applications, and functional genomics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Plants perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate PRR-triggered immunity (PTI). Despite extensive research on PTI in model plant species, the evolutionary trajectory and emergence of PRRs remain elusive. Here we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components among 350 plant species. Our findings reveal that cell-surface receptors comprise two major classes, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs), with RLP being more ancient whereas RLK families have undergone significant expansion. We also demonstrate that multiple downstream signalling components have an ancient origin within the plant lineage. To shed light on the immune-specificity of PRRs, we traced the evolutionary origin of immune-specific leucine-rich repeat-RLPs (LRR-RLPs) in plants. Surprisingly, we discovered that the last four LRR motifs crucial for co-receptor interaction in LRR-RLPs are closely related to those of the LRR-RLK subgroup Xb, which primarily governs growth and development. Functional characterisation further reveals that LRR-RLPs initiate immune responses through their juxtamembrane and transmembrane regions, while LRR-RLK-Xb members regulate development through their cytosolic kinase domains. Our data suggest modular evolution of cell-surface receptors in which immunity- and development-specific cell-surface receptors share a common origin. After diversification, their ectodomains, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions have either diversified or stabilised to recognize ligands that activate different downstream responses. We propose that cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components are ancient, and likely predate the emergence of land plants, subsequently evolving to exhibit greater complexity and specificity within the land plant lineage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants rely on autophagy and membrane trafficking to tolerate stress, combat infections, and maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular interplay between autophagy and membrane trafficking is poorly understood. Using an AI-assisted approach, we identified Rab3GAP-like (Rab3GAPL) as an important membrane trafficking node that controls plant autophagy negatively. Rab3GAPL suppresses autophagy by binding to ATG8, the core autophagy adaptor, and deactivating Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for autophagosome formation and defense-related secretion. Rab3GAPL from Nicotiana benthamiana, but not its mutated form deficient in ATG8 binding, reduced autophagic flux in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, Rab3GAPL-knockout mutants of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha exhibited enhanced autophagic flux under both normal and heat stress conditions, suggesting that Rab3GAPLs negative regulatory role in autophagy is conserved in land plants. Beyond autophagy regulation, Rab3GAPL modulates focal immunity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans by preventing defense-related secretion. Altogether, our results suggest that Rab3GAPL acts as a molecular rheostat to coordinate autophagic flux and defense-related secretion by restraining Rab8a-mediated trafficking. This unprecedented interplay between a RabGAP-Rab pair and ATG8 sheds new light on the intricate membrane transport mechanisms underlying plant autophagy and immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To respond appropriately to diverse stimuli, cells harbour numerous receptor pathways yet share downstream signalling components. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) cascades, present in all eukaryotes, act as central hubs shared amongst diverse signalling pathways. How signalling specificity is maintained within a single plant cell-type is not well understood. We engineered a genetic background for direct comparisons of a developmental and an immunity pathway in the Arabidopsis root endodermis. We show the two pathways maintain distinct outputs despite similar MPK phosphorylation patterns. Systematic activation of all individual MPK Kinases (MKKs) in the endodermis revealed that different MKK groups can drive distinct outputs. We propose that specificity is achieved through a balance of combinatorial activation and cross-pathway inhibition within the MPK cascade. Our findings demonstrate the ability of MPK cascades to generate diverse outputs in one plant cell-type, providing new insights into the mechanisms contributing to signalling specificity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phytocytokines are hormone-like plant peptides that modulate immune homeostasis and development. Phytosulfokine (PSK) mediates plant growth and attenuates activation of plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). We show that the small cysteine-containing effector VdSCP8 from Verticillium dahliae (Vd) is a virulence-promoting protein that suppresses PTI in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Apoplastic SCP8 suppresses immune activation through leucine-rich repeat ectodomain pattern recognition receptors. SCP8 virulence and immunosuppressive activities require PHYTOSULFOKINE RECEPTOR 1 (PSKR1), which binds PSK and forms a complex with co-receptor BAK1 for PTI suppression. We find that PSK, like SCP8, suppresses PTI, SCP8 stimulates PSKR1-BAK1 complex formation, and that Vd requires PSK signaling for host infection. SCP8 interacts with an apoplastic subtilase, and co-expression of SCP8 and subtilase inhibitors reduces PTI suppression. Our findings suggest that a multi-host plant pathogen manipulates PTI by enhancing immunosuppressive PSK signaling, likely through plant subtilase activity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) mediates a trade-off between growth and defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the precise biochemical mechanism by which ACD6 and related proteins in plants act remains enigmatic. Here, we identified two loci, MODULATOR OF HYPERACTIVE ACD6 1 (MHA1) and its paralog MHA1-LIKE (MHA1L), that code for ~7 kDa proteins that differentially interact with specific ACD6 variants. MHA1L enhances accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. ACD6 is a multipass transmembrane protein with intracellular ankyrin repeats that are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels. Several lines of evidence link increased ACD6 activity to enhanced calcium influx, likely mediated by ACD6 itself and with MHA1L as a direct regulator of ACD6.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone that regulates a plethora of physiological processes including immunity and development and is perceived by the F-Box protein, Coronatine-insensitive protein 1(COI1). The discovery of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in the COI1 receptor complex highlights their role in JA perception. InsPs are phosphate-rich signaling molecules that control many aspects of plant physiology. Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are diphosphate containing InsP species of which InsP7 and InsP8 are the best characterized ones. Different InsP and PP-InsP species are linked with JA-related plant immunity. However, role of PP-InsP species in regulating JA-dependent developmental processes are poorly understood. Recent identification of ITPK1 kinase responsible for the production of 5-InsP7 from InsP6 in planta provides a platform to interrogate possible involvement of ITPK-derived InsP species in JA-related plant development. Herein this study, we report that ITPK1-defective plants exhibit increased root growth inhibition to bioactive JA treatment. The itpk1 plants also show increased lateral root density when treated with JA. Notably, JA treatment does not induce ITPK1 protein level. Gene expression analyses revealed that JA-biosynthetic genes are not differentially expressed in the ITPK1-deficient plants. We further demonstrate that genes encoding different JAZ repressor proteins are severely downregulated in the ITPK1-defective plants. Taken together, our study highlights the role of ITPK1 in regulating JA-dependent root architecture development through controlling expression of different JAZ repressor proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulation in the maternally-derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, Brassica rapa mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these closely-related species, we produced RdDM mutations in three additional members of the Brassicaceae family: Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, and Capsella grandiflora. Among these three species, only mutations in Capsella grandiflora displayed a seed production defect similar to Brassica rapa mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant organs (compartments) host distinct microbiota which shift in response to variation in both development and climate. Grapevines are woody perennial crops that are clonally propagated and cultivated across vast geographic areas, and as such, their microbial communities may also reflect site-specific influences. These site-specific influences, and the microbial differences across site compose  terroir, the environmental influence on wine produced in a given region. Commercial grapevines are typically composed of a genetically distinct root (rootstock) grafted to a shoot system (scion) which adds an additional layer of complexity. In order to understand spatial and temporal patterns of bacterial diversity in grafted grapevines, we used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to quantify soil and compartment microbiota (berries, leaves, and roots) for grafted grapevines in commercial vineyards across three counties in the Central Valley of California over two successive growing seasons. Community composition revealed compartment-specific dynamics. Roots assembled site-specific bacterial communities that reflect rootstock genotype and environment influences, whereas bacterial communities of leaves and berries displayed associations with time. These results provide further evidence of a microbial terroir within the grapevine root systems but also reveal that the microbiota of above-ground compartments are only weakly associated with the local microbiome in the Central Valley of California.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Throughout their life, plant root are submitted to mechanical stresses due to pressure exerted by the soil. So far, few studies addressed root cell deformation and calcium signaling elicited by soil compression. In this study, we designed a microchip inspired by pneumatic microvalve concept in order to deliver a lateral pressure to the root of a plant expressing the RGECO1-mTurquoise calcium reporter. Lateral pressure applied on the root induced a moderate elastic deformation of root cortical cells and elicited a multicomponent calcium signal at the onset of the pressure pulse, followed by a second one at the release of the pressure. This indicates that straining rather than stressing of tissues is relevant to trigger the calcium signal. The calcium elevation was restricted to the tissue under pressure and did not propagate. Additionally, the calcium signals exhibited a remarkable attenuation upon repetitive stimulations.

Highlights- A microvalve concept mimicking lateral soil pressure was developed.
- Non-damaging lateral compression of the root induces an elastic deformation of cortical cells.
- A multicomponent calcium signal is elicited at the onset of a pressure pulse and upon release of the pressure.
- Straining rather than stressing of tissues is relevant to trigger the calcium signal.
- The calcium signal is localized at the tissue under pressure and does not propagate.
- Calcium signals exhibit a remarkable attenuation upon repetitive stimulations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transcription factors (TFs) are essential for the regulation of gene expression and cell fate determination. Characterising the transcriptional activity of TF genes in space and time is a critical step towards understanding complex biological systems. The vegetative gametophyte meristems of bryophytes share some characteristics with the shoot-apical meristems of flowering plants. However, the identity and expression profiles of TFs associated with gametophyte organization are largely unknown. With only [~]450 TF genes, Marchantia polymorpha is an outstanding model system for plant systems biology. We have generated a near-complete collection of promoter elements derived from Marchantia TF genes. We experimentally tested in planta reporter fusions for all the TF promoters in the collection and systematically analysed expression patterns in Marchantia gemmae. This allowed us to build a map of precise expression domains and identify a unique set of TFs expressed in the stem-cell zone, providing new insight into the dynamic regulation of the gametophytic meristem and its evolution. In addition, we provide an online database of expression patterns for all promoters in the collection. We expect that the promoter elements characterised here will be useful for cell-type specific expression, synthetic biology applications, and functional genomics.</p>
