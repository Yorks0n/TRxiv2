However, the manner of their interaction is mostly unknown. We reasoned that this may be revealed by studying autophagy in a climacteric fruit ripening context, for which ethylene is crucial. During ripening, fruits undergo softening, color change, toxic compound degradation, volatile production, and sugar assembly by fine-tuning synthesis and degradation of their cellular content. For autophagy activity assessment, we analyzed autophagy-related 8 (ATG8) lipidation and GFP-ATG8-labeled autophagosome flux in tomato fruit cells. Autophagy activity increased sharply from ripening initiation, climaxed at its middle stage, and declined towards its end, resembling ethylene production dynamics. Silencing the core-autophagy genes SlATG2, SlATG7, and SlATG4 separately in mature fruits resulted in early ethylene production and ripening onset, which was abrogated by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene signaling inhibitor. Beyond ripening, Arabidopsis atg5 and atg7 mutant seedlings exhibited elevated ethylene production and sensitivity to 1-Aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC), ethylenes precursor, which induces autophagy. This research demonstrates that autophagy limits tomato fruit ripening via a general role in ethylene restriction, opening the path for a mechanistic understanding of autophagy-ethylene crosstalk and harnessing autophagy for fruit shelf-life extension.\nA common regulatory switch controls a suite of C4 traits in multiple cell types\nAuthors: Camo-Escobar, D.; Alcala-Gutierrez, C.; Palafox-Figueroa, E.; Guillotin, B.; Hernandez-Coronado, M.; Coyac-Rodriguez, J. L.; Cerbantez-Bueno, V. E.; Velez-Ramirez, A.; de Folter, S.; Birnbaum, K. D.; Ortiz-Ramirez, C. H.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572850\nThe C4 photosynthetic pathway provided a major advantage to plants growing in hot, dry environments, including the ancestors of our most productive crops. Two traits were essential for the evolution of this pathway: increased vein density and the functionalization of bundle sheath cells for photosynthesis. Although GRAS transcriptional regulators, including SHORT ROOT (SHR), have been implicated in mediating leaf patterning in both C3 and C4 species, little is known about what controls the specialized features of the cells that mediate C4 metabolism and physiology. We show in the model monocot, Setaria viridis, that SHR regulates components of multiple cell identities, including chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic gene expression in bundle sheath cells, a central feature of C4 plants. Furthermore, we found that it also contributes to the two-cell compartmentalization of the characteristic four-carbon shuttle pathway. Disruption of SHR function clearly reduced photosynthetic capacity and seed yield in mutant plants under heat stress. Together, these results show how cell identities are remodeled by SHR to host the suite of traits characteristic of C4 regulation, which are a main engineering target in non-C4 crops to improve climate resilience.\nWhy can we detect lianas from space?\nAuthors: Visser, M. D.; Detto, M.; Meunier, F.; Wu, J.; Bongalov, B.; Coomes, D.; Nunes, M. H.; Guzman Q., J. A.; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A.; Foster, J.; Broadbent, E.; Verbeeck, H.; Marvin, D.; Chandler, C.

W.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2021.09.30.462145\nLianas, woody vines acting as structural parasites of trees, have profound effects on the composition and structure of tropical forests, impacting tree growth, mortality, and forest succession. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for quantifying the scale of liana infestation, provided the availability of robust detection methods. We analyze the consistency and global specificity of spectral signals from liana-infested tree crowns and forest stands, examining the underlying mechanisms. We compiled a database, including leaf reflectance spectra from 5424 leaves, fine-scale airborne reflectance data from 999 liana-infested canopies, and coarse-scale satellite reflectance data covering hectares of liana-infested forest stands. To unravel the mechanisms of the liana spectral signal, we applied mechanistic radiative transfer models across scales, corroborated by field data on liana leaf chemistry and canopy structure. We find a consistent liana spectral signature at canopy and stand scales across sites. This signature mainly arises at the canopy level due to direct effects of leaf angles, resulting in a larger apparent leaf area, and indirect effects from increased light scattering in the NIR and SWIR regions, linked to lianas less costly leaf construction compared to trees. The existence of a consistent global spectral signal for lianas suggests that large-scale quantification of liana infestation is feasible. However, because the traits identified are not exclusive to lianas, accurate large-scale detection requires rigorously validated remote sensing methods. Our models highlight challenges in automated detection, such as potential misidentification due to leaf phenology, tree life-history, topography, and climate, especially where the scale of liana infestation is less than a single remote sensing pixel. The observed cross-site patterns also prompt ecological questions about lianas adaptive similarities across environments, indicating possible convergent evolution due to shared constraints on leaf biochemical and structural traits.

P.; Li, Z. P.; Paterlini, A.; Moreau, H.; Fouillen, L.; GRISON, M. S.; Cana-Quijada, P.; Moraes, T. S.; Immel, F.; Wattelet, V.; Ducros, M.; Brocard, L.; Chambaud, C.; Zabrady, M.; Luo, Y.; Busch, W.; Tilsner, J.; Helariutta, Y.; Russinova, J.; Taly, A.; Jaillais, Y.; Bayer, E.\nScore: 34.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572149\nMembrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities. In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion C_LI\nDistinct roles of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 in vernalization response, maintenance and resetting in winter wheat\nAuthors: Liu, X.; Lin, X.; Deng, M.; Shi, B.; Chen, J.; Li, H.; Xu, S.; Bie, X.; Zhang, X.; Chong, K.; Xiao, J.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572364\nWinter plants rely on vernalization, a vital process for adapting to cold and ensuring successful reproduction. However, understanding the role of histone modifications in guiding the vernalization process in winter wheat is limited. In this study, we investigate the transcriptome and chromatin dynamics in the shoot apex throughout the life cycle of winter wheat in the field. Two core histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, exhibit opposite pattern on the key vernalization gene VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1), correlated with its induction during cold exposure. Additionally, H3K36me3 remains high at VRN1 after cold exposure, maintaining its active state. Mutations in FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (TaFIE) and SET DOMAIN GROUP 8 (TaSDG8), writer complex components of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, respectively, affect flowering time. Interestingly, VRN1 loses its high expression after cold exposure memory in the absence of H3K36me3. During embryo development, VRN1 is silenced with the removal of H3K36me3 in both winter and spring alleles. H3K27me3 is selectively added to the winter allele, influencing the cold exposure requirement for the next generation. Integrating gene expression with H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 patterns identified potential regulators of flowering. This study reveals distinct roles of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 in controlling vernalization response, maintenance, and resetting in winter wheat. Significance StatementVernalization, initially observed in cereals, lacks a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanism, particularly regarding chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation in winter wheat. By delving into the transcriptome and chromatin dynamics in the shoot apex throughout winter wheats life cycle, we pinpointed two crucial histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, each playing distinct roles at different vernalization stages. H3K27me3 is implicated in establishing and resetting the extended cold exposure requirement for winter wheat, gradually diminishing during vernalization. On the other hand, H3K36me3 is crucial for maintaining VRN1s active state post-cold exposure, contributing to the memory of the vernalization treatment. Additionally, the integration of transcriptome and histone modification profiles unveiled potential novel regulators of flowering in winter wheat.\nPhytochrome-dependent responsiveness to root-derived cytokinins enables coordinated elongation responses to combined light and nitrate cues.\nAuthors: Gautrat, P.; Buti, S.; Romanowski, A.; Buijs, G.; Pierik, R.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572814\nPlants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.\nFrom Selfies to Science - Precise 3D Leaf Measurement with iPhone 13 and Its Implications for Plant Development and Transpiration\nAuthors: Bar-Sella, G.; Gavish, M.; Moshelion, M.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573617\nAdvanced smartphone technology has unified sophisticated, cost-effective sensors, broadening access to high-precision data acquisition. This study aimed to validate the hypothesis that the iPhone 13-Pro camera, in conjunction with its LiDAR technology, can accurately extract information such as the surface area of maize leaves (Zea mays). 3D point cloud models enabled remote, non-destructive trait data collection, and four methods for 3D canopy area extraction were compared to assess their relation with wole-plant transpiration rates. The experimental findings demonstrated a robust correlation (R^2=0.88, RMSE=62.45) between manually scanned surface area and the iPhone 3-dimentional estimated plant surface area. Furthermore, the study revealed that the ratio of stem to total plant surface area is 11.6% (R^2=0.91, RMSE=30.20). Utilizing this ratio for predicting canopy surface area from total plant surface area resulted in a significant correlation (R^2=0.89) with the measured canopy. The mobile iPhone's surface area measurement tool offers a significant advantage by providing the capability to scan the entire plant surface area. This contrasts with the projected leaf area index measurements taken by most commercial top canopy scanners, which are unable to penetrate the canopy like manual measurements do. An additional advantage of the real size surface measurement of the whole canopy is its high correlation (R^2=0.83) with the whole canopy transpiration rate, as was measured using a gravimetric system on the same scanned plants. This study presents a novel method for analyzing 3D plant traits with a portable, accurate, and affordable tool, enhancing selection processes for plant breeders and advancing agricultural practices.\nMass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy profiles of red and pink Rhododendron flower petals establish them as rich sources of bioactive secondary metabolites\nAuthors: Shagun, S.; Lingwan, M.; Masakapalli, S. K.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573342\nRhododendron petals are considered high-value owing to their commercial utility, national/state flower status in certain countries, and bioactive potential from recent studies. Profiling and quantitative analysis of the bioactive metabolites would evaluate if they can be natural sources. This study is focused on comprehensive profiling of secondary metabolites in the petals of Red and Pink Rhododendron flowers (R. arboreum and R. campanulatum) using Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS/MS) and Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) Spectroscopy. The profiling highlighted the presence of secondary metabolites belonging to phenolic acids and flavonoids. Specifically, the flowers are rich in promising bioactive molecules such as quinic acid, chlorogenic acid (3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid), protocatechuic acid, coumaroyl quinic acids, catechin, epigallocatechin, and shikimic acid. The profiles are correlated with the metabolic pathways which reflected the activity of shikimic acid, phenolic acid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. These metabolites are well reported for their bioactive potential as anti-oxidative, anti-viral, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, etc. While the quantitative and multivariate analysis showed variations in the levels of phenolic acids and flavonoids, it is established that red and pink Rhododendron flower petals are a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals of interest to the phytochemical Industry.\nClimate Change and Phenological Monitoring of the Indigenous Godello Variety in a Territory of Heroic Viticulture and Biosphere Reserve\nAuthors: Fernandez Conde, M. E.; Bisarya, D.; Perlado Taglinao, L.; Cortinas Rodriguez, J. A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573298\nAn evaluation of the phenological behaviour of the indigenous Godello variety of vineyard was conducted within the Souto Chao plot in the year 2023. This plot is located in a wine-growing region holding a Designation of Origin (Ribeira Sacra DO) located in the North-West of the Iberian Peninsula. A similar study had been conducted in 2017 and 2018, focusing on the same Godello variety within the identical plot involving the same plant as the current study. The assessment utilized the BBCH scale, a system proposed by Biologische Bundesanstalt fur Land und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie. The average duration of the vegetative cycle in the initial two years under examination was 167 days (161 and 174 days in 2017 and 2018, respectively), while in 2023 it was 164 days. In these three years studies during 2017, 2018 and 2023, the longest phenological phase was of 79 days when majority of the berries were touching). The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the nature and extent of changes in the crops phenology within the timeframe between the initial two years analysed (2017 and 2018) and the present year, 2023.\nInvestigating genomic prediction strategies for grain carotenoid traits in a tropical/subtropical maize panel\nAuthors: LaPorte, M.-F.; Suwarno, W.; Hannok, P.; Koide, A.; Bradbury, P. J.; Crossa, J.; Palacios-Rojas, N.; Diepenbrock, C. H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573624\nVitamin A deficiency remains prevalent on a global scale, including in regions where maize constitutes a high percentage of human diets. One solution for alleviating this deficiency has been to increase grain concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.)--an example of biofortification. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) developed a Carotenoid Association Mapping panel of 380 inbred lines adapted to tropical and subtropical environments that have varying grain concentrations of provitamin A and other health-beneficial carotenoids. This project assesses the accuracy of several genomic prediction (GP) strategies for these traits ({beta}-carotene, {beta}-cryptoxanthin, provitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin) within and between four environments in Mexico. Methods employing Ridge Regression-Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, Elastic Net, or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces had high accuracy in predicting all tested provitamin A carotenoid traits and outperformed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Furthermore, prediction accuracies were higher when using genome-wide markers rather than only the markers proximal to two previously identified carotenoid-related genes that have been used in marker-assisted selection, suggesting that GP is worthwhile for these traits, even though key genes have already been identified. Prediction accuracy was maintained for all traits (except lutein) in between-environment prediction. The TASSEL (Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution, and Linkage) Genomic Selection plugin performed as well as other more computationally intensive methods for within-environment prediction. The findings observed herein indicate the utility of GP methods for these traits and could inform their resource-efficient implementation in biofortification breeding programs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway, and the phytohormone ethylene function in plant development, senescence, and stress responses. However, the manner of their interaction is mostly unknown. We reasoned that this may be revealed by studying autophagy in a climacteric fruit ripening context, for which ethylene is crucial. During ripening, fruits undergo softening, color change, toxic compound degradation, volatile production, and sugar assembly by fine-tuning synthesis and degradation of their cellular content. For autophagy activity assessment, we analyzed autophagy-related 8 (ATG8) lipidation and GFP-ATG8-labeled autophagosome flux in tomato fruit cells. Autophagy activity increased sharply from ripening initiation, climaxed at its middle stage, and declined towards its end, resembling ethylene production dynamics. Silencing the core-autophagy genes SlATG2, SlATG7, and SlATG4 separately in mature fruits resulted in early ethylene production and ripening onset, which was abrogated by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene signaling inhibitor. Beyond ripening, Arabidopsis atg5 and atg7 mutant seedlings exhibited elevated ethylene production and sensitivity to 1-Aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC), ethylenes precursor, which induces autophagy. This research demonstrates that autophagy limits tomato fruit ripening via a general role in ethylene restriction, opening the path for a mechanistic understanding of autophagy-ethylene crosstalk and harnessing autophagy for fruit shelf-life extension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The C4 photosynthetic pathway provided a major advantage to plants growing in hot, dry environments, including the ancestors of our most productive crops. Two traits were essential for the evolution of this pathway: increased vein density and the functionalization of bundle sheath cells for photosynthesis. Although GRAS transcriptional regulators, including SHORT ROOT (SHR), have been implicated in mediating leaf patterning in both C3 and C4 species, little is known about what controls the specialized features of the cells that mediate C4 metabolism and physiology. We show in the model monocot, Setaria viridis, that SHR regulates components of multiple cell identities, including chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic gene expression in bundle sheath cells, a central feature of C4 plants. Furthermore, we found that it also contributes to the two-cell compartmentalization of the characteristic four-carbon shuttle pathway. Disruption of SHR function clearly reduced photosynthetic capacity and seed yield in mutant plants under heat stress. Together, these results show how cell identities are remodeled by SHR to host the suite of traits characteristic of C4 regulation, which are a main engineering target in non-C4 crops to improve climate resilience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lianas, woody vines acting as structural parasites of trees, have profound effects on the composition and structure of tropical forests, impacting tree growth, mortality, and forest succession. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for quantifying the scale of liana infestation, provided the availability of robust detection methods. We analyze the consistency and global specificity of spectral signals from liana-infested tree crowns and forest stands, examining the underlying mechanisms. We compiled a database, including leaf reflectance spectra from 5424 leaves, fine-scale airborne reflectance data from 999 liana-infested canopies, and coarse-scale satellite reflectance data covering hectares of liana-infested forest stands. To unravel the mechanisms of the liana spectral signal, we applied mechanistic radiative transfer models across scales, corroborated by field data on liana leaf chemistry and canopy structure. We find a consistent liana spectral signature at canopy and stand scales across sites. This signature mainly arises at the canopy level due to direct effects of leaf angles, resulting in a larger apparent leaf area, and indirect effects from increased light scattering in the NIR and SWIR regions, linked to lianas less costly leaf construction compared to trees. The existence of a consistent global spectral signal for lianas suggests that large-scale quantification of liana infestation is feasible. However, because the traits identified are not exclusive to lianas, accurate large-scale detection requires rigorously validated remote sensing methods. Our models highlight challenges in automated detection, such as potential misidentification due to leaf phenology, tree life-history, topography, and climate, especially where the scale of liana infestation is less than a single remote sensing pixel. The observed cross-site patterns also prompt ecological questions about lianas adaptive similarities across environments, indicating possible convergent evolution due to shared constraints on leaf biochemical and structural traits.

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities.

In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins

HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface
C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow
C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers
C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion

        <p class="abstract">Winter plants rely on vernalization, a vital process for adapting to cold and ensuring successful reproduction. However, understanding the role of histone modifications in guiding the vernalization process in winter wheat is limited. In this study, we investigate the transcriptome and chromatin dynamics in the shoot apex throughout the life cycle of winter wheat in the field. Two core histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, exhibit opposite pattern on the key vernalization gene VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1), correlated with its induction during cold exposure. Additionally, H3K36me3 remains high at VRN1 after cold exposure, maintaining its active state. Mutations in FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (TaFIE) and SET DOMAIN GROUP 8 (TaSDG8), writer complex components of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, respectively, affect flowering time. Interestingly, VRN1 loses its high expression after cold exposure memory in the absence of H3K36me3. During embryo development, VRN1 is silenced with the removal of H3K36me3 in both winter and spring alleles. H3K27me3 is selectively added to the winter allele, influencing the cold exposure requirement for the next generation. Integrating gene expression with H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 patterns identified potential regulators of flowering. This study reveals distinct roles of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 in controlling vernalization response, maintenance, and resetting in winter wheat.

Significance StatementVernalization, initially observed in cereals, lacks a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanism, particularly regarding chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation in winter wheat. By delving into the transcriptome and chromatin dynamics in the shoot apex throughout winter wheats life cycle, we pinpointed two crucial histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, each playing distinct roles at different vernalization stages. H3K27me3 is implicated in establishing and resetting the extended cold exposure requirement for winter wheat, gradually diminishing during vernalization. On the other hand, H3K36me3 is crucial for maintaining VRN1s active state post-cold exposure, contributing to the memory of the vernalization treatment. Additionally, the integration of transcriptome and histone modification profiles unveiled potential novel regulators of flowering in winter wheat.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advanced smartphone technology has unified sophisticated, cost-effective sensors, broadening access to high-precision data acquisition. This study aimed to validate the hypothesis that the iPhone 13-Pro camera, in conjunction with its LiDAR technology, can accurately extract information such as the surface area of maize leaves (Zea mays). 3D point cloud models enabled remote, non-destructive trait data collection, and four methods for 3D canopy area extraction were compared to assess their relation with wole-plant transpiration rates. The experimental findings demonstrated a robust correlation (R^2=0.88, RMSE=62.45) between manually scanned surface area and the iPhone 3-dimentional estimated plant surface area. Furthermore, the study revealed that the ratio of stem to total plant surface area is 11.6% (R^2=0.91, RMSE=30.20). Utilizing this ratio for predicting canopy surface area from total plant surface area resulted in a significant correlation (R^2=0.89) with the measured canopy. The mobile iPhone&#39;s surface area measurement tool offers a significant advantage by providing the capability to scan the entire plant surface area. This contrasts with the projected leaf area index measurements taken by most commercial top canopy scanners, which are unable to penetrate the canopy like manual measurements do. An additional advantage of the real size surface measurement of the whole canopy is its high correlation (R^2=0.83) with the whole canopy transpiration rate, as was measured using a gravimetric system on the same scanned plants. This study presents a novel method for analyzing 3D plant traits with a portable, accurate, and affordable tool, enhancing selection processes for plant breeders and advancing agricultural practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rhododendron petals are considered high-value owing to their commercial utility, national/state flower status in certain countries, and bioactive potential from recent studies. Profiling and quantitative analysis of the bioactive metabolites would evaluate if they can be natural sources. This study is focused on comprehensive profiling of secondary metabolites in the petals of Red and Pink Rhododendron flowers (R. arboreum and R. campanulatum) using Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS/MS) and Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) Spectroscopy. The profiling highlighted the presence of secondary metabolites belonging to phenolic acids and flavonoids. Specifically, the flowers are rich in promising bioactive molecules such as quinic acid, chlorogenic acid (3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid), protocatechuic acid, coumaroyl quinic acids, catechin, epigallocatechin, and shikimic acid. The profiles are correlated with the metabolic pathways which reflected the activity of shikimic acid, phenolic acid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. These metabolites are well reported for their bioactive potential as anti-oxidative, anti-viral, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, etc. While the quantitative and multivariate analysis showed variations in the levels of phenolic acids and flavonoids, it is established that red and pink Rhododendron flower petals are a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals of interest to the phytochemical Industry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An evaluation of the phenological behaviour of the indigenous Godello variety of vineyard was conducted within the Souto Chao plot in the year 2023. This plot is located in a wine-growing region holding a Designation of Origin (Ribeira Sacra DO) located in the North-West of the Iberian Peninsula. A similar study had been conducted in 2017 and 2018, focusing on the same Godello variety within the identical plot involving the same plant as the current study.

The assessment utilized the BBCH scale, a system proposed by Biologische Bundesanstalt fur Land und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie.

The average duration of the vegetative cycle in the initial two years under examination was 167 days (161 and 174 days in 2017 and 2018, respectively), while in 2023 it was 164 days. In these three years studies during 2017, 2018 and 2023, the longest phenological phase was of 79 days when majority of the berries were touching).

The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the nature and extent of changes in the crops phenology within the timeframe between the initial two years analysed (2017 and 2018) and the present year, 2023.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vitamin A deficiency remains prevalent on a global scale, including in regions where maize constitutes a high percentage of human diets. One solution for alleviating this deficiency has been to increase grain concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.)--an example of biofortification. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) developed a Carotenoid Association Mapping panel of 380 inbred lines adapted to tropical and subtropical environments that have varying grain concentrations of provitamin A and other health-beneficial carotenoids. This project assesses the accuracy of several genomic prediction (GP) strategies for these traits ({beta}-carotene, {beta}-cryptoxanthin, provitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin) within and between four environments in Mexico. Methods employing Ridge Regression-Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, Elastic Net, or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces had high accuracy in predicting all tested provitamin A carotenoid traits and outperformed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Furthermore, prediction accuracies were higher when using genome-wide markers rather than only the markers proximal to two previously identified carotenoid-related genes that have been used in marker-assisted selection, suggesting that GP is worthwhile for these traits, even though key genes have already been identified. Prediction accuracy was maintained for all traits (except lutein) in between-environment prediction. The TASSEL (Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution, and Linkage) Genomic Selection plugin performed as well as other more computationally intensive methods for within-environment prediction. The findings observed herein indicate the utility of GP methods for these traits and could inform their resource-efficient implementation in biofortification breeding programs.</p>
