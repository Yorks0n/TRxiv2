P.\nScore: 28.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549889\nWood constitutes the majority of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TDIF ligand-activated PXY receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-dependent PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell.\nThe WY domain of an RxLR effector drives interactions with a host target phosphatase to mimic host regulatory proteins and promote Phytophthora infestans infection.\nAuthors: Bentham, A. R.; Wang, W.; Trusch, F.; Varden, F.; Birch, P. R.; Banfield, M. J.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550319\nPlant pathogens manipulate the cellular environment of the host to facilitate infection and colonization, often leading to plant diseases. To accomplish this, many specialized pathogens secrete virulence proteins called effectors into the host cell, which subvert processes such as immune signalling, gene transcription, and host metabolism. Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight, employs an expanded repertoire of RxLR effectors with WY domains to manipulate the host through direct interaction with protein targets. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between WY effectors and their host targets remains limited. In this study, we performed a structural and biophysical characterization of the P. infestans WY effector, Pi04314, in complex with the potato Protein Phosphatase 1-c (PP1c). We elucidate how Pi04314 uses a WY domain and a specialised C-terminal loop carrying a KVxF motif that interact with conserved surfaces on PP1c, known to be used by host regulatory proteins for guiding function. Through biophysical and in planta analyses, we demonstrate that Pi04314 WY or KVxF mutants lose their ability to bind PP1c. The loss of PP1c binding correlates with a reduced capacity to re-localize PP1c from the nucleolus and a decrease in lesion size in plant infection assays. This study provides insights into the manipulation of plant hosts by pathogens, revealing how effectors exploit key regulatory interfaces in host proteins to modify their function and facilitate disease.\nRoot barrier surveillance mechanisms convey soil nitrogen status to shoots\nAuthors: Shen, D.; Wippel, K.; Remmel, S.; Zhang, P.; Kuertoes, N.; Neumann, U.; Kopriva, S.; Andersen, T. G.\nScore: 43.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.19.537470\nIn roots, formation of the Casparian strip in the endodermal cell walls provides a mechanism for selective uptake of nutrients and water. Establishment of this filter is under spatial surveillance by a receptor-ligand mechanism termed the Schengen pathway. This system provides a mechanism to initiate downstream signaling responses in case of dysfunctional barrier establishment. Due to this interconnected nature, the endogenous physiological role of this survaillance mechanism remain difficult to untangle from the direct barrier function. This is in particularly evident in complex growth setups where multiple inputs are integrated into general whole-plant responses. In this work, we address this by rewiring the genetic network that underlies root barrier formation. We create plants with enhanced, Schengen-independent Casparian strip formation that are not only suitable to probe the role of stronger barrier establishment, but also to evaluate the associated signaling output independently. With focus on the latter, we subjected the rewired plants, as well as a number of established barrier mutants, to multifaceted growth conditions including nitrogen fertilized agricultural soil conditions. By profiling their above- and belowground (a)biotic responses our work reveals that, while increased Casparian strip formation mainly provides the plant with an improved stress resistance, the Schengen pathway is necessary for establishment of a growth-promoting root microbiome and serves to convey information of soil nitrogen status to the shoot. This identifies the Schengen pathway as an essential receptor-based signaling hub for adaptive integration of barrier status, nutritional responses and (a)biotic signaling between above- and belowground tissues.\nCompositae-ParaLoss-1272: Complementary sunflower specific probe-set reduces issues with paralogs in complex systems\nAuthors: Moore-Pollard, E. R.; Jones, D. S.; Mandel, J. R.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549085\nPremiseThe sunflower family specific probe set, Compositae-1061, has enabled family-wide phylogenomic studies and investigations at lower-taxonomic levels by targeting 1,000+ genes. However, it generally lacks resolution at the genus to species level, especially in groups with complex evolutionary histories including polyploidy and hybridization. MethodsIn this study, we developed a new Hyb-Seq probe set, Compositae-ParaLoss-1272, designed to target orthologous loci in Asteraceae family members. We tested its efficiency across the family by simulating target-enrichment sequencing in silico. Additionally, we tested its effectiveness at lower taxonomic levels in genus Packera which has a complex evolutionary and taxonomic history. We performed Hyb-Seq with Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 for 19 taxa which were previously studied using the Compositae-1061 probe set. Sequences from both probe sets were used to generate phylogenies, compare topologies, and assess node support. ResultsWe report that Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 captured loci across all tested Asteraceae members. Additionally, Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 had less gene tree discordance, recovered considerably fewer paralogous sequences, and retained longer loci than Compositae-1061. DiscussionGiven the complexity of plant evolutionary histories, assigning orthology for phylogenomic analyses will continue to be challenging. However, we anticipate this new probe set will provide improved resolution and utility for studies at lower-taxonomic levels and complex groups in the sunflower family.\nPhenomic vs Genomic Prediction - A Comparison of Prediction Accuracies for Grain Yield in Hard Winter Wheat Lines\nAuthors: Winn, Z. J.; Amsberry, A.; Haley, S. D.; DeWitt, N. D.; Mason, E.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549748\nCommon bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a key component of global diets, but the genetic improvement of wheat is not keeping pace with the growing demands of the worlds population. To increase efficiency and reduce costs, breeding programs are rapidly adopting the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) to conduct high-throughput spectral analyses. This study examined the effectiveness of multispectral indices in predicting grain yield compared to genomic prediction. Multispectral data were collected on advanced generation yield nursery trials during the 2019-2021 growing seasons in the Colorado State University Wheat Breeding Program. Genome-wide genotyping was performed on these advanced generations and all plots were harvested to measure grain yield. Two methods were used to predict grain yield: genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) generated by a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP) model and phenomic phenotypic estimates (PPEs) using only spectral indices via multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF) models. In cross-validation, PPEs produced by MLR, KNN, and RF models had higher prediction accuracy ([r]: 0.41 [\u0026le;][r] [\u0026le;] 0.48) than GEBVs produced by gBLUP ([r] = 0.35). In leave-one-year-out forward validation using only multispectral data for 2020 and 2021, PPEs from MLR and KNN models had higher prediction accuracy of grain yield than GEBVs of those same lines. These findings suggest that a limited number of spectra may produce PPEs that are more accurate than or equivalently accurate as GEBVs derived from gBLUP, and this method should be evaluated in earlier development material where sequencing is not feasible.\nResolving evolutionary relationships in the groundsels: phylogenomics, divergence time estimates, and biogeography of Packera (Asteraceae: Senecioneae)\nAuthors: Moore-Pollard, E. R.; Mandel, J. R.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549592\nThe genus Packera belongs to the sunflower family and contains an estimated 64 species and varieties endemic to North America. Some Packera are known to hybridize or exhibit polyploidy, making it difficult to reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the group. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies of Packera employing ITS data recovered low resolution trees, providing little information on the evolutionary relationships within this complex genus. Therefore, we used next-generation sequencing data to infer nuclear and plastid phylogenies of Packera and related Senecioneae taxa. The nuclear phylogeny was calibrated to produce a timetree, then used to reconstruct the macroevolutionary history of Packera, including its historical biogeography. We then compared the reconstructed evolutionary history to previously published scenarios based on phylogenetic and geohistorical data. We found that the nuclear and plastid phylogenies were highly incongruent, with the nuclear tree presenting higher resolution than the plastid tree which had an apparent lack of plastid diversity. The nuclear tree indicated that geography may have played a major role in the evolution and taxonomic diversification of Packera. The estimated origin of Packera at approximately 19.2MY - 25.9MY (late Oligocene to early Miocene) is older than in most other studies. Nonetheless, it aligns well with previous geohistorical predictions, which suggest that speciation and diversification events in Packera were driven by changes in geography and climate in North America. Moreover, Packera likely originated in the western United States or Mexico, and subsequently diversified north and east into the rest of North America and Russia, in agreement with other studies.\nDevelopment of a mobile, high-throughput, and low-cost image-based plant growth phenotyping system\nAuthors: Yu, L.; Sussman, H.; Khmelnitsky, O.; Ishka, M. R.; Srinivasan, A.; Nelson, A.; Julkowska, M. M.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549560\nNondestructive plant phenotyping is fundamental for unraveling molecular processes underlying plant development and response to the environment. While the emergence of high-through phenotyping facilities can further our understanding of plant development and stress responses, their high costs significantly hinder scientific progress. To democratize high-throughput plant phenotyping, we developed sets of low-cost image- and weight-based devices to monitor plant growth and evapotranspiration. We paired these devices with a suite of computational pipelines for integrated and straightforward data analysis. We validated the suitability of our system for large screens by evaluating a cowpea diversity panel for responses to drought stress. The observed natural variation was subsequently used for Genome-Wide Association Study, where we identified nine genetic loci that putatively contribute to cowpea drought resilience during early vegetative development. We validated the homologs of the identified candidate genes in Arabidopsis using available mutant lines. These results demonstrate the varied applicability of this low-cost phenotyping system. In the future, we foresee these setups facilitating identification of genetic components of growth, plant architecture, and stress tolerance across a wide variety of species.\nTemperature acclimation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism are related to the geographical origin of Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Hernandez, J. S.; Dziubek, D.; Schroeder, L.; Seydel, C.; Kitashova, A.; Brodsky, V.; Naegele, T.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549837\nAcclimation is a multigenic trait by which plants adjust photosynthesis and metabolism to cope with a changing environment. Here, natural variation of photosynthetic and metabolic acclimation was analyzed in response to low and elevated temperature. For this, 18 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, originating from Africa and Europe, were grown at 22{degrees}C before being exposed to 4{degrees}C and 34{degrees}C for cold and heat acclimation, respectively. Amounts of carbohydrates were quantified together with their subcellular distribution across plastids, cytosol and vacuole. Linear electron transport rates (ETRs) were determined together with maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) for all growth conditions and under temperature fluctuation. Under elevated temperature, residuals of ETR under increasing photosynthetic photon flux densities were found to significantly correlate with the longitudinal gradient of the geographic origin of accessions indicating a naturally occurring east-west gradient of photosynthetic acclimation capacities. Further, in heat acclimated plants, vacuolar fructose amount was found to positively correlate with longitude while plastidial and cytosolic amounts were found to be negatively correlated. Plastidial sucrose concentrations were found to positively correlate with maximal ETRs under fluctuating temperature indicating a stabilizing role within the chloroplast. In summary, our findings revealed specific subcellular carbohydrate distributions which contribute differentially to photosynthetic efficiencies of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions across a longitudinal gradient. This sheds light on the relevance of subcellular metabolic regulation for photosynthetic performance in a fluctuating environment and supports the physiological interpretation of naturally occurring genetic variation of temperature tolerance and acclimation.\nSugar co-ordinates plant defence signalling\nAuthors: Yamada, K.; Mine, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549975\nRecognition of microbial molecules triggers energy-intensive defence systems. Although successful defence should therefore depend on energy availability, whether and, if so, how cellular metabolic information is molecularly input into defence remains unclear. We show that sugar, especially glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), plays a key role in regulating the types and amplitudes of defence outputs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under sugar-sufficient conditions, protein and phosphorylation levels of calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5) are elevated by induced expression and G6P-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases, priming defence responses. Furthermore, recognition of bacterial flagellin activates sugar transporters, leading to increased cellular G6P, which elicits CPK5-independent signalling promoting synthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) involved in anti-bacterial defence. In contrast, while perception of fungal chitin does not promote sugar influx or SA accumulation, chitin-induced synthesis of the anti-fungal compound camalexin requires basal sugar influx activity. These results suggest that, by monitoring G6P levels, plants determine defence priming levels and execute appropriate outputs against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Together, our findings provide a comprehensive view of the roles of sugar in plant defence.\nMonitoring single root hairs using a micro-chambered hydroponics system MiCHy reveals a new mode of action of the aminosteroid U73122\nAuthors: Shikata, H.; Sato, Y.; Schwechheimer, C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549431\nWhen using chemical probes and inhibitors for cell biological studies, the uniform and rapid access of the chemical to the sample is key for the accuracy of the analysis. Until now, however, this could only be accomplished by using expensive equipment and labor-intensive and often lengthy procedures. Here, we introduce MiCHy, a micro-chambered hydroponics system, as an accessible and versatile method for chemical treatments and demonstrate its use for imaging roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, the major model system for plant cell biological research. Using lipid biosensors in combination with established chemicals, such as the phosphoinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitor phenylarsine oxide and the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor U73122, we demonstrate the suitability of MiCHy for studying the relationship between growth and lipid dynamics in root hairs. We further reveal novel effects of U73122 on the plasma membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 3 (PIP5K3), which is the first evidence demonstrating a role for U73122 besides its role as a PI-PLC inhibitor in plants.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Wood constitutes the majority of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TDIF ligand-activated PXY receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-dependent PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant pathogens manipulate the cellular environment of the host to facilitate infection and colonization, often leading to plant diseases. To accomplish this, many specialized pathogens secrete virulence proteins called effectors into the host cell, which subvert processes such as immune signalling, gene transcription, and host metabolism. Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight, employs an expanded repertoire of RxLR effectors with WY domains to manipulate the host through direct interaction with protein targets. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between WY effectors and their host targets remains limited. In this study, we performed a structural and biophysical characterization of the P. infestans WY effector, Pi04314, in complex with the potato Protein Phosphatase 1-c (PP1c). We elucidate how Pi04314 uses a WY domain and a specialised C-terminal loop carrying a KVxF motif that interact with conserved surfaces on PP1c, known to be used by host regulatory proteins for guiding function. Through biophysical and in planta analyses, we demonstrate that Pi04314 WY or KVxF mutants lose their ability to bind PP1c. The loss of PP1c binding correlates with a reduced capacity to re-localize PP1c from the nucleolus and a decrease in lesion size in plant infection assays. This study provides insights into the manipulation of plant hosts by pathogens, revealing how effectors exploit key regulatory interfaces in host proteins to modify their function and facilitate disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In roots, formation of the Casparian strip in the endodermal cell walls provides a mechanism for selective uptake of nutrients and water. Establishment of this filter is under spatial surveillance by a receptor-ligand mechanism termed the Schengen pathway. This system provides a mechanism to initiate downstream signaling responses in case of dysfunctional barrier establishment. Due to this interconnected nature, the endogenous physiological role of this survaillance mechanism remain difficult to untangle from the direct barrier function. This is in particularly evident in complex growth setups where multiple inputs are integrated into general whole-plant responses. In this work, we address this by rewiring the genetic network that underlies root barrier formation. We create plants with enhanced, Schengen-independent Casparian strip formation that are not only suitable to probe the role of stronger barrier establishment, but also to evaluate the associated signaling output independently. With focus on the latter, we subjected the rewired plants, as well as a number of established barrier mutants, to multifaceted growth conditions including nitrogen fertilized agricultural soil conditions. By profiling their above- and belowground (a)biotic responses our work reveals that, while increased Casparian strip formation mainly provides the plant with an improved stress resistance, the Schengen pathway is necessary for establishment of a growth-promoting root microbiome and serves to convey information of soil nitrogen status to the shoot. This identifies the Schengen pathway as an essential receptor-based signaling hub for adaptive integration of barrier status, nutritional responses and (a)biotic signaling between above- and belowground tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PremiseThe sunflower family specific probe set, Compositae-1061, has enabled family-wide phylogenomic studies and investigations at lower-taxonomic levels by targeting 1,000&#43; genes. However, it generally lacks resolution at the genus to species level, especially in groups with complex evolutionary histories including polyploidy and hybridization.

MethodsIn this study, we developed a new Hyb-Seq probe set, Compositae-ParaLoss-1272, designed to target orthologous loci in Asteraceae family members. We tested its efficiency across the family by simulating target-enrichment sequencing in silico. Additionally, we tested its effectiveness at lower taxonomic levels in genus Packera which has a complex evolutionary and taxonomic history. We performed Hyb-Seq with Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 for 19 taxa which were previously studied using the Compositae-1061 probe set. Sequences from both probe sets were used to generate phylogenies, compare topologies, and assess node support.

ResultsWe report that Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 captured loci across all tested Asteraceae members. Additionally, Compositae-ParaLoss-1272 had less gene tree discordance, recovered considerably fewer paralogous sequences, and retained longer loci than Compositae-1061.

DiscussionGiven the complexity of plant evolutionary histories, assigning orthology for phylogenomic analyses will continue to be challenging. However, we anticipate this new probe set will provide improved resolution and utility for studies at lower-taxonomic levels and complex groups in the sunflower family.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a key component of global diets, but the genetic improvement of wheat is not keeping pace with the growing demands of the worlds population. To increase efficiency and reduce costs, breeding programs are rapidly adopting the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) to conduct high-throughput spectral analyses. This study examined the effectiveness of multispectral indices in predicting grain yield compared to genomic prediction. Multispectral data were collected on advanced generation yield nursery trials during the 2019-2021 growing seasons in the Colorado State University Wheat Breeding Program. Genome-wide genotyping was performed on these advanced generations and all plots were harvested to measure grain yield. Two methods were used to predict grain yield: genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) generated by a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP) model and phenomic phenotypic estimates (PPEs) using only spectral indices via multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF) models. In cross-validation, PPEs produced by MLR, KNN, and RF models had higher prediction accuracy ([r]: 0.41 [&amp;le;][r] [&amp;le;] 0.48) than GEBVs produced by gBLUP ([r] = 0.35). In leave-one-year-out forward validation using only multispectral data for 2020 and 2021, PPEs from MLR and KNN models had higher prediction accuracy of grain yield than GEBVs of those same lines. These findings suggest that a limited number of spectra may produce PPEs that are more accurate than or equivalently accurate as GEBVs derived from gBLUP, and this method should be evaluated in earlier development material where sequencing is not feasible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The genus Packera belongs to the sunflower family and contains an estimated 64 species and varieties endemic to North America. Some Packera are known to hybridize or exhibit polyploidy, making it difficult to reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the group. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies of Packera employing ITS data recovered low resolution trees, providing little information on the evolutionary relationships within this complex genus. Therefore, we used next-generation sequencing data to infer nuclear and plastid phylogenies of Packera and related Senecioneae taxa. The nuclear phylogeny was calibrated to produce a timetree, then used to reconstruct the macroevolutionary history of Packera, including its historical biogeography. We then compared the reconstructed evolutionary history to previously published scenarios based on phylogenetic and geohistorical data. We found that the nuclear and plastid phylogenies were highly incongruent, with the nuclear tree presenting higher resolution than the plastid tree which had an apparent lack of plastid diversity. The nuclear tree indicated that geography may have played a major role in the evolution and taxonomic diversification of Packera. The estimated origin of Packera at approximately 19.2MY - 25.9MY (late Oligocene to early Miocene) is older than in most other studies. Nonetheless, it aligns well with previous geohistorical predictions, which suggest that speciation and diversification events in Packera were driven by changes in geography and climate in North America. Moreover, Packera likely originated in the western United States or Mexico, and subsequently diversified north and east into the rest of North America and Russia, in agreement with other studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nondestructive plant phenotyping is fundamental for unraveling molecular processes underlying plant development and response to the environment. While the emergence of high-through phenotyping facilities can further our understanding of plant development and stress responses, their high costs significantly hinder scientific progress. To democratize high-throughput plant phenotyping, we developed sets of low-cost image- and weight-based devices to monitor plant growth and evapotranspiration. We paired these devices with a suite of computational pipelines for integrated and straightforward data analysis. We validated the suitability of our system for large screens by evaluating a cowpea diversity panel for responses to drought stress. The observed natural variation was subsequently used for Genome-Wide Association Study, where we identified nine genetic loci that putatively contribute to cowpea drought resilience during early vegetative development. We validated the homologs of the identified candidate genes in Arabidopsis using available mutant lines. These results demonstrate the varied applicability of this low-cost phenotyping system. In the future, we foresee these setups facilitating identification of genetic components of growth, plant architecture, and stress tolerance across a wide variety of species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acclimation is a multigenic trait by which plants adjust photosynthesis and metabolism to cope with a changing environment. Here, natural variation of photosynthetic and metabolic acclimation was analyzed in response to low and elevated temperature. For this, 18 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, originating from Africa and Europe, were grown at 22{degrees}C before being exposed to 4{degrees}C and 34{degrees}C for cold and heat acclimation, respectively. Amounts of carbohydrates were quantified together with their subcellular distribution across plastids, cytosol and vacuole. Linear electron transport rates (ETRs) were determined together with maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) for all growth conditions and under temperature fluctuation. Under elevated temperature, residuals of ETR under increasing photosynthetic photon flux densities were found to significantly correlate with the longitudinal gradient of the geographic origin of accessions indicating a naturally occurring east-west gradient of photosynthetic acclimation capacities. Further, in heat acclimated plants, vacuolar fructose amount was found to positively correlate with longitude while plastidial and cytosolic amounts were found to be negatively correlated. Plastidial sucrose concentrations were found to positively correlate with maximal ETRs under fluctuating temperature indicating a stabilizing role within the chloroplast. In summary, our findings revealed specific subcellular carbohydrate distributions which contribute differentially to photosynthetic efficiencies of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions across a longitudinal gradient. This sheds light on the relevance of subcellular metabolic regulation for photosynthetic performance in a fluctuating environment and supports the physiological interpretation of naturally occurring genetic variation of temperature tolerance and acclimation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recognition of microbial molecules triggers energy-intensive defence systems. Although successful defence should therefore depend on energy availability, whether and, if so, how cellular metabolic information is molecularly input into defence remains unclear. We show that sugar, especially glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), plays a key role in regulating the types and amplitudes of defence outputs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under sugar-sufficient conditions, protein and phosphorylation levels of calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5) are elevated by induced expression and G6P-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases, priming defence responses. Furthermore, recognition of bacterial flagellin activates sugar transporters, leading to increased cellular G6P, which elicits CPK5-independent signalling promoting synthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) involved in anti-bacterial defence. In contrast, while perception of fungal chitin does not promote sugar influx or SA accumulation, chitin-induced synthesis of the anti-fungal compound camalexin requires basal sugar influx activity. These results suggest that, by monitoring G6P levels, plants determine defence priming levels and execute appropriate outputs against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Together, our findings provide a comprehensive view of the roles of sugar in plant defence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When using chemical probes and inhibitors for cell biological studies, the uniform and rapid access of the chemical to the sample is key for the accuracy of the analysis. Until now, however, this could only be accomplished by using expensive equipment and labor-intensive and often lengthy procedures. Here, we introduce MiCHy, a micro-chambered hydroponics system, as an accessible and versatile method for chemical treatments and demonstrate its use for imaging roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, the major model system for plant cell biological research. Using lipid biosensors in combination with established chemicals, such as the phosphoinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitor phenylarsine oxide and the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor U73122, we demonstrate the suitability of MiCHy for studying the relationship between growth and lipid dynamics in root hairs. We further reveal novel effects of U73122 on the plasma membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 3 (PIP5K3), which is the first evidence demonstrating a role for U73122 besides its role as a PI-PLC inhibitor in plants.</p>
