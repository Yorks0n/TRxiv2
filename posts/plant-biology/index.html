Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities. In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion C_LI\nPhytochrome-dependent responsiveness to root-derived cytokinins enables coordinated elongation responses to combined light and nitrate cues.\nAuthors: Gautrat, P.; Buti, S.; Romanowski, A.; Buijs, G.; Pierik, R.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572814\nPlants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.\nA root-specific NLR network confers resistance to plant parasitic nematodes\nAuthors: Luedke, D.; Sakai, T.; Kourelis, J.; Toghani, A.; Adachi, H.; Posbeyikian, A.; Frijters, R.; Pai, H.; Harant, A.; Ernst, K.; Ganal, M.; Verhage, A.; Wu, C.-H.; Kamoun, S.\nScore: 71.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571630\nNucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) confer disease resistance to a multitude of foliar and root parasites of plants. However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.\nThe Zea mays PeptideAtlas; a new maize community resource\nAuthors: van Wijk, K. J.; Leppert, T.; Sun, Z.; Guzchenko, I.; Debley, E.; Sauermann, G.; Routray, P.; Mendoza, L.; Sun, Q.; Deutsch, E. W.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572651\nWe developed the Maize PeptideAtlas resource (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/maize) to help solve questions about the maize proteome. Publicly available raw tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data for maize were collected from ProteomeXchange and reanalyzed through a uniform processing and metadata annotation pipeline. These data are from a wide range of genetic backgrounds, including the inbred lines B73 and W22, many hybrids and their respective parents. Samples were collected from field trials, controlled environmental conditions, a range of (a)biotic conditions and different tissues, cell types and subcellular fractions. The protein search space included different maize genome annotations for the B73 inbred line from MaizeGDB, UniProtKB, NCBI RefSeq and for the W22 inbred line. 445 million MS/MS spectra were searched, of which 120 million were matched to 0.37 million distinct peptides. Peptides were matched to 66.2% of the proteins (one isoform per protein coding gene) in the most recent B73 nuclear genome annotation (v5). Furthermore, most conserved plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins (NCBI RefSeq annotations) were identified. Peptides and proteins identified in the other searched B73 genome annotations will aid to improve maize genome annotation. We also illustrate high confidence detection of unique SNPs in the W22 proteome as compared to the B73 proteome. N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and three lysine acylations (K-acetyl, K-malonyl, K-hydroxybutyryl) were identified and can be inspected through a PTM viewer in PeptideAtlas. All matched MS/MS-derived peptide data are linked to spectral, technical and biological metadata. This new PeptideAtlas will be integrated with community resources including MaizeGDB at https://www.maizegdb.org/ and its JBrowse tracks.\nWhy can we detect lianas from space?\nAuthors: Visser, M.

W.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2021.09.30.462145\nLianas, woody vines acting as structural parasites of trees, have profound effects on the composition and structure of tropical forests, impacting tree growth, mortality, and forest succession. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for quantifying the scale of liana infestation, provided the availability of robust detection methods. We analyze the consistency and global specificity of spectral signals from liana-infested tree crowns and forest stands, examining the underlying mechanisms. We compiled a database, including leaf reflectance spectra from 5424 leaves, fine-scale airborne reflectance data from 999 liana-infested canopies, and coarse-scale satellite reflectance data covering hectares of liana-infested forest stands. To unravel the mechanisms of the liana spectral signal, we applied mechanistic radiative transfer models across scales, corroborated by field data on liana leaf chemistry and canopy structure. We find a consistent liana spectral signature at canopy and stand scales across sites. This signature mainly arises at the canopy level due to direct effects of leaf angles, resulting in a larger apparent leaf area, and indirect effects from increased light scattering in the NIR and SWIR regions, linked to lianas less costly leaf construction compared to trees. The existence of a consistent global spectral signal for lianas suggests that large-scale quantification of liana infestation is feasible. However, because the traits identified are not exclusive to lianas, accurate large-scale detection requires rigorously validated remote sensing methods. Our models highlight challenges in automated detection, such as potential misidentification due to leaf phenology, tree life-history, topography, and climate, especially where the scale of liana infestation is less than a single remote sensing pixel. The observed cross-site patterns also prompt ecological questions about lianas adaptive similarities across environments, indicating possible convergent evolution due to shared constraints on leaf biochemical and structural traits. Open data statementOf the 17 datasets used, 10 are published and publicly accessible, with links provided in this submission (Appendix S1: Section S1).

Stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to self-renew and to produce differentiating cells. Our research focused on unraveling the mechanisms governing the specification of these two distinct cell fates following the stem cell division. For this purpose, we used the model organism Physcomitrium patens, which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible of cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins. We propose a cytokinin-based model for the establishment of asymmetry in the pluripotent stem cell division. One Sentence SummaryCytokinins are confined to the pluripotent stem cells and exclude the differentiation factor TAW1 to establish the SAM from a single stem cell.\nAltered defense patterns upon retrotransposition highlights the potential for rapid adaptation by transposable elements\nAuthors: Aller, E.; Kanstrup, C.; Hunziker, P.; Kliebenstein, D. J.; Burow, M.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572632\nTransposable elements can be activated in response to environmental changes and lead to changes in DNA sequence. Their target sites of insertions have previously been thought to be random, but this theory has lately been contradicted. For instance, mobilization is favored towards genes involved in regulatory processes. This makes them interesting as potential players in rapid responses required under stressful environmental conditions. In this paper, we report the in-depth characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0-based line whose altered DNA methylation pattern made it vulnerable for transposable element movement. We identified a transposable element retrotransposition into a transporter of glucosinolate defense compounds. As a consequence of this transposable element movement, the plants showed tissue-specific changes in glucosinolate profiles and levels accompanied by rewiring of glucosinolate- and defense-related transcriptional changes. As this single transposable element had strong impact on the plants resistance to insect herbivory, our findings highlight the potential for transposable elements to play a role in plant adaptation.\nUnraveling the Role of P450 Reductase in Herbicide Metabolic Resistance Mechanism\nAuthors: Rigon, C. A. G.; Iwakami, S.; Gaines, T.; Dayan, F.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572429\nO_LIPlants require cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to supply two electrons for cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes (P450) to react with an organic substrate. The transfer of electrons to the P450 active site in the P450 catalytic site relies on a robust and intricate CPR:P450 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. C_LIO_LITransgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying CYP81A12 from Echinochloa phyllopogon, which metabolize a broad spectrum of herbicides, were crossed with CPR knockout atr1 or atr2 mutant lines. Homozygous gene knockout was confirmed using PCR, and gene copy number of CYP81A12 was determined using ddPCR. Arabidopsis lines expressing CYP81A12 in combination with atr1 or atr2 knockout were used for herbicide dose-response and metabolism studies. C_LIO_LIKnocking out ATR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis CYP81A12 significantly reduced herbicide resistance. Transgenic mutant plants (CYP81A12 atr1-b) had a 3.6-, 5.6-, 6.8- and at least 26- fold reduction in resistance to mesotrione, 2,4-D, penoxsulam and chlorsulfuron, respectively, in the dose-response assay. Knockouts of the ATR2 also decreased herbicide resistance, but to a lower magnitude than ATR1. These results were confirmed through the [1/2] MS medium assay, and herbicide resistance reduction was observed for additional tested herbicides, bensulfuron, propoxycarbazone and bentazon. C_LIO_LIOur findings highlight the importance of CPRs in metabolic herbicide resistance in plants, specifically identifying that ATR1 is the most important in the CPR:P450 complex in Arabidopsis for herbicide metabolism. The different CPRs found in weeds have potential as target genes to manage herbicide resistance evolution. We further provide an in-depth exploration of the evolutionary implications in weed management arising from the results. C_LI\nA common regulatory switch controls a suite of C4 traits in multiple cell types\nAuthors: Camo-Escobar, D.; Alcala-Gutierrez, C.; Palafox-Figueroa, E.; Guillotin, B.; Hernandez-Coronado, M.; Coyac-Rodriguez, J. L.; Cerbantez-Bueno, V. E.; Velez-Ramirez, A.; de Folter, S.; Birnbaum, K. D.; Ortiz-Ramirez, C. H.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572850\nThe C4 photosynthetic pathway provided a major advantage to plants growing in hot, dry environments, including the ancestors of our most productive crops. Two traits were essential for the evolution of this pathway: increased vein density and the functionalization of bundle sheath cells for photosynthesis. Although GRAS transcriptional regulators, including SHORT ROOT (SHR), have been implicated in mediating leaf patterning in both C3 and C4 species, little is known about what controls the specialized features of the cells that mediate C4 metabolism and physiology. We show in the model monocot, Setaria viridis, that SHR regulates components of multiple cell identities, including chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic gene expression in bundle sheath cells, a central feature of C4 plants. Furthermore, we found that it also contributes to the two-cell compartmentalization of the characteristic four-carbon shuttle pathway. Disruption of SHR function clearly reduced photosynthetic capacity and seed yield in mutant plants under heat stress. Together, these results show how cell identities are remodeled by SHR to host the suite of traits characteristic of C4 regulation, which are a main engineering target in non-C4 crops to improve climate resilience.\nThe activated plant NRC4 immune receptor forms a hexameric resistosome\nAuthors: Liu, F.; Yang, Z.; Wang, C.; Martin, R.; Qiao, W.; Carette, J. E.; Luan, S.; Nogales, E.; Staskawicz, B.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571367\nInnate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as \"helper\" NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with \"sensor\" NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses. One Sentence SummaryThe hexameric NRC4 resistosome mediates cell death associated with cytosolic Ca2+ influx.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCSs diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities.

In briefPlant intercellular communication is regulated via tubular membrane contact through PI4P binding-ER-PM tether MCTP proteins

HighlightsO_LI- Plasmodesmata are unconventional ER/PM tubular contact sites sitting at cell-cell interface
C_LIO_LI- Plasmodesmata act as control valves, adjusting the ER-PM contacts to modulate cytosolic flow
C_LIO_LI- MCTP3, MCTP4, MCTP6 and PI4P tethering elements act as valve-size controllers
C_LIO_LI- MCTP/PI4P tethers function independently of callose levels to regulate cell-to-cell diffusion

        <p class="abstract">Plants growing at high densities can detect competitors through changes in the composition of light reflected by neighbours. In response to this far-red-enriched light, plants elicit adaptive shade avoidance responses for light capture, but these need to be balanced against other input signals, such as nutrient availability. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics, growth assays and dedicated genetic and pharmacological interventions to demonstrate how Arabidopsis integrates light and nitrate signalling. We unveiled that nitrate modulates shade avoidance via a previously unknown shade response pathway that involves root-derived transZeatin (tZ). Under nitrate-sufficient conditions, tZ promotes hypocotyl elongation specifically in the presence of supplemental far-red light. This occurs via PIF transcription factors-dependent inhibition of type-A ARRs cytokinin response inhibitors. Our data thus reveal how plants co-regulate responses to shade cues with root-derived information about nutrient availability, and how they restrict responses to this information to specific light conditions in the shoot.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) confer disease resistance to a multitude of foliar and root parasites of plants. However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We developed the Maize PeptideAtlas resource (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/maize) to help solve questions about the maize proteome. Publicly available raw tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data for maize were collected from ProteomeXchange and reanalyzed through a uniform processing and metadata annotation pipeline. These data are from a wide range of genetic backgrounds, including the inbred lines B73 and W22, many hybrids and their respective parents. Samples were collected from field trials, controlled environmental conditions, a range of (a)biotic conditions and different tissues, cell types and subcellular fractions. The protein search space included different maize genome annotations for the B73 inbred line from MaizeGDB, UniProtKB, NCBI RefSeq and for the W22 inbred line. 445 million MS/MS spectra were searched, of which 120 million were matched to 0.37 million distinct peptides. Peptides were matched to 66.2% of the proteins (one isoform per protein coding gene) in the most recent B73 nuclear genome annotation (v5). Furthermore, most conserved plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins (NCBI RefSeq annotations) were identified. Peptides and proteins identified in the other searched B73 genome annotations will aid to improve maize genome annotation. We also illustrate high confidence detection of unique SNPs in the W22 proteome as compared to the B73 proteome. N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and three lysine acylations (K-acetyl, K-malonyl, K-hydroxybutyryl) were identified and can be inspected through a PTM viewer in PeptideAtlas. All matched MS/MS-derived peptide data are linked to spectral, technical and biological metadata. This new PeptideAtlas will be integrated with community resources including MaizeGDB at https://www.maizegdb.org/ and its JBrowse tracks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lianas, woody vines acting as structural parasites of trees, have profound effects on the composition and structure of tropical forests, impacting tree growth, mortality, and forest succession. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for quantifying the scale of liana infestation, provided the availability of robust detection methods. We analyze the consistency and global specificity of spectral signals from liana-infested tree crowns and forest stands, examining the underlying mechanisms. We compiled a database, including leaf reflectance spectra from 5424 leaves, fine-scale airborne reflectance data from 999 liana-infested canopies, and coarse-scale satellite reflectance data covering hectares of liana-infested forest stands. To unravel the mechanisms of the liana spectral signal, we applied mechanistic radiative transfer models across scales, corroborated by field data on liana leaf chemistry and canopy structure. We find a consistent liana spectral signature at canopy and stand scales across sites. This signature mainly arises at the canopy level due to direct effects of leaf angles, resulting in a larger apparent leaf area, and indirect effects from increased light scattering in the NIR and SWIR regions, linked to lianas less costly leaf construction compared to trees. The existence of a consistent global spectral signal for lianas suggests that large-scale quantification of liana infestation is feasible. However, because the traits identified are not exclusive to lianas, accurate large-scale detection requires rigorously validated remote sensing methods. Our models highlight challenges in automated detection, such as potential misidentification due to leaf phenology, tree life-history, topography, and climate, especially where the scale of liana infestation is less than a single remote sensing pixel. The observed cross-site patterns also prompt ecological questions about lianas adaptive similarities across environments, indicating possible convergent evolution due to shared constraints on leaf biochemical and structural traits.

        <p class="abstract">The shoot apical meristem (SAM) contains pluripotent stem cells that produce all the aerial parts of the plant. Stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to self-renew and to produce differentiating cells. Our research focused on unraveling the mechanisms governing the specification of these two distinct cell fates following the stem cell division. For this purpose, we used the model organism Physcomitrium patens, which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible of cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins. We propose a cytokinin-based model for the establishment of asymmetry in the pluripotent stem cell division.

One Sentence SummaryCytokinins are confined to the pluripotent stem cells and exclude the differentiation factor TAW1 to establish the SAM from a single stem cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transposable elements can be activated in response to environmental changes and lead to changes in DNA sequence. Their target sites of insertions have previously been thought to be random, but this theory has lately been contradicted. For instance, mobilization is favored towards genes involved in regulatory processes. This makes them interesting as potential players in rapid responses required under stressful environmental conditions. In this paper, we report the in-depth characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0-based line whose altered DNA methylation pattern made it vulnerable for transposable element movement. We identified a transposable element retrotransposition into a transporter of glucosinolate defense compounds. As a consequence of this transposable element movement, the plants showed tissue-specific changes in glucosinolate profiles and levels accompanied by rewiring of glucosinolate- and defense-related transcriptional changes. As this single transposable element had strong impact on the plants resistance to insect herbivory, our findings highlight the potential for transposable elements to play a role in plant adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIPlants require cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to supply two electrons for cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes (P450) to react with an organic substrate. The transfer of electrons to the P450 active site in the P450 catalytic site relies on a robust and intricate CPR:P450 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
C_LIO_LITransgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying CYP81A12 from Echinochloa phyllopogon, which metabolize a broad spectrum of herbicides, were crossed with CPR knockout atr1 or atr2 mutant lines. Homozygous gene knockout was confirmed using PCR, and gene copy number of CYP81A12 was determined using ddPCR. Arabidopsis lines expressing CYP81A12 in combination with atr1 or atr2 knockout were used for herbicide dose-response and metabolism studies.
C_LIO_LIKnocking out ATR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis CYP81A12 significantly reduced herbicide resistance. Transgenic mutant plants (CYP81A12 atr1-b) had a 3.6-, 5.6-, 6.8- and at least 26- fold reduction in resistance to mesotrione, 2,4-D, penoxsulam and chlorsulfuron, respectively, in the dose-response assay. Knockouts of the ATR2 also decreased herbicide resistance, but to a lower magnitude than ATR1. These results were confirmed through the [1/2] MS medium assay, and herbicide resistance reduction was observed for additional tested herbicides, bensulfuron, propoxycarbazone and bentazon.
C_LIO_LIOur findings highlight the importance of CPRs in metabolic herbicide resistance in plants, specifically identifying that ATR1 is the most important in the CPR:P450 complex in Arabidopsis for herbicide metabolism. The different CPRs found in weeds have potential as target genes to manage herbicide resistance evolution. We further provide an in-depth exploration of the evolutionary implications in weed management arising from the results.

        <p class="abstract">The C4 photosynthetic pathway provided a major advantage to plants growing in hot, dry environments, including the ancestors of our most productive crops. Two traits were essential for the evolution of this pathway: increased vein density and the functionalization of bundle sheath cells for photosynthesis. Although GRAS transcriptional regulators, including SHORT ROOT (SHR), have been implicated in mediating leaf patterning in both C3 and C4 species, little is known about what controls the specialized features of the cells that mediate C4 metabolism and physiology. We show in the model monocot, Setaria viridis, that SHR regulates components of multiple cell identities, including chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic gene expression in bundle sheath cells, a central feature of C4 plants. Furthermore, we found that it also contributes to the two-cell compartmentalization of the characteristic four-carbon shuttle pathway. Disruption of SHR function clearly reduced photosynthetic capacity and seed yield in mutant plants under heat stress. Together, these results show how cell identities are remodeled by SHR to host the suite of traits characteristic of C4 regulation, which are a main engineering target in non-C4 crops to improve climate resilience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Innate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as &#34;helper&#34; NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with &#34;sensor&#34; NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2&#43; influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses.

One Sentence SummaryThe hexameric NRC4 resistosome mediates cell death associated with cytosolic Ca2&#43; influx.</p>
