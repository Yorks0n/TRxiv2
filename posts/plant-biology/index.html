J.\nScore: 36.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562914\nFilamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins into host cells to suppress host defence responses and manipulate metabolic processes to support colonization. Understanding the evolution and molecular function of these effectors provides knowledge about pathogenesis and can suggest novel strategies to reduce damage caused by pathogens. However, effector proteins are highly variable, share weak sequence similarity and, although they can be grouped according to their structure, only a few structurally conserved effector families have been functionally characterized to date. Here, we demonstrate that Zinc-finger fold (ZiF) secreted proteins form a functionally diverse effector family in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. This family relies on the Zinc-finger motif for protein stability and is ubiquitously present, forming different effector tribes in blast fungus lineages infecting 13 different host species. Homologs of the canonical ZiF effector, AVR-Pii from rice infecting isolates, are present in multiple M. oryzae lineages, and the wheat infecting strains of the fungus, for example, possess an allele that also binds host Exo70 proteins and activates the immune receptor Pii. Furthermore, ZiF tribes vary in the host Exo70 proteins they bind, indicating functional diversification and an intricate effector/host interactome. Altogether, we uncovered a new effector family with a common protein fold that has functionally diversified in lineages of M. oryzae. This work expands our understanding of the diversity of M. oryzae effectors, the molecular basis of plant pathogenesis and may ultimately facilitate the development of new sources for pathogen resistance. Author SummaryDiseases caused by filamentous plant pathogens impact global food production, leading to severe economic and humanitarian consequences. These pathogens secrete hundreds of effectors inside the host to alter cellular processes and to promote infection and disease. Effector proteins have weak or no sequence similarity but can be grouped in structural families based on conserved protein folds. However, very few conserved effector families have been functionally characterized. We have identified a family of effectors with a shared Zinc-finger protein fold (ZiF) that is present in lineages of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that can, collectively, infect 13 different grasses. We characterized the binding of a sub-set of these proteins to putative Exo70 host targets and showed they can be recognized by the plant immune system. Furthermore, we show that other ZiF effectors do not bind Exo70 targets, suggesting functional specialization within this effector family for alternative interactors. These findings shed light on the diversity of effectors and their molecular functions, as well as potentially leading to the development of new sources of blast disease resistance in the future.\nThe NRC0 gene cluster of sensor and helper NLR immune receptors is functionally conserved across asterid plants\nAuthors: Sakai, T.; Martinez-Anaya, C.; Contreras, M. P.; Kamoun, S.; Wu, C.-H.; Adachi, H.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563533\nNLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing) proteins can form complex receptor networks to confer innate immunity. NRCs are phylogenetically related nodes that function downstream of a massively expanded network of disease resistance proteins that protect against multiple plant pathogens. Here, we used phylogenomic methods to reconstruct the macroevolution of the NRC family. One of the NRCs, we termed NRC0, is the only family member shared across asterid plants, leading us to investigate its evolutionary history and genetic organization. In several asterid species, NRC0 is genetically clustered to other NLRs that are phylogenetically related to NRC-dependent disease resistance genes. This prompted us to hypothesize that the ancestral state of the NRC network is an NLR helper-sensor gene cluster that was present early during asterid evolution. We validated this hypothesis by demonstrating that NRC0 is essential for the hypersensitive cell death induced by its genetically linked sensor NLR partners in four divergent asterid species: tomato, wild sweet potato, coffee and carrot. In addition, activation of a sensor NLR leads to high-order complex formation of its genetically linked NRC0 similar to other NRCs. Our findings map out contrasting evolutionary dynamics in the macroevolution of the NRC network over the last 125 million years from a functionally conserved NLR gene cluster to a massive genetically dispersed network.\nA precise balance of TETRASPANIN1/TORNADO2 activity is required for vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Konstantinova, N.; Mor, E.; Verhelst, E.; Nolf, J.; Vereecken, K.; Wang, F.; Van Damme, D.; De Rybel, B.; Glanc, M.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562921\nThe molecular mechanisms guiding oriented cell divisions in the root vascular tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana are still poorly characterized. By overlapping bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we unveiled TETRASPANIN1 (TET1) as a putative regulator in this process. TET1 is expressed in root vascular cells and loss-of-function mutants contain fewer vascular cells files. We further generated and characterized a CRISPR deletion mutant and show, unlike previously described mutants, that the full knock out is additionally missing endodermal cells in a stochastic way. Finally, we show that HA-tagged versions of TET1 are functional in contrast to fluorescent TET1 translational fusions. Immunostaining using HA-TET1 lines complementing the mutant phenotype revealed a dual plasma membrane and intracellular localization in the root vasculature and a polar membrane localization in young cortex, endodermal and initial cells. Taken together, we show that TET1 is involved in both vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning. Our initial results pave the way for future work into deciphering its precise mode of action.\nTransporter-mediated depletion of extracellular proline directly contributes to plant pattern-triggered immunity against a bacterial pathogen\nAuthors: Rogan, C. J.; Pang, Y.-Y.; Mathews, S. D.; Turner, S. E.; Weisberg, A. J.; Lehmann, S.; Rentsch, D.; Anderson, J. C.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562815\nPlants possess cell surface-localized immune receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate defenses that provide effective resistance against microbial pathogens. Many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) limits pathogen growth in plants is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against P. syringae. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant innate immunity. Given the important role for amino acids as nutrients for microbial growth, their depletion at sites of infection may be a broadly effective means for defense against many pathogens.\nRegulated Cleavage and Relocation of FERONIA Control Immunity in Arabidopsis Roots\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Qiang, X.; Liu, H.; Xu, F.; Wang, L.; Jiang, L.; Li, C.; Wang, B.; Luan, S.; Wu, D.; Zhou, F.; Yu, F.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562456\nPlant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity. One Sentence SummaryBacteria induces the cleavage of FER via At2-MMP to trigger a localized immunity around TZ and EZ of Arabidopsis roots.\nA simplified disease resistance assay using YFP-expressing Potato Virus X in N. benthamiana reveals a cell death-independent immune function of RBA1\nAuthors: Hasegawa, K.; Timmers, T.; Chai, J.; Maekawa, T.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563110\nR (resistance) proteins, such as intracellular NLRs (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors), are integral components of the plant innate immune system. Host responses following R protein activation include the generation of reactive oxygen species, sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2+, transcriptional reprogramming and, typically, rapid host cell death at sites of pathogen infection, which together ultimately lead to pathogen growth restriction. To assess the activity of R proteins, agroinfiltration-mediated transient gene expression assays have been widely used in Nicotiana species (e.g., N. benthamiana). In these transient assays, host cell death is often chosen as an indicator of R protein activity from the host responses mentioned above, in part because of the ease of experimentation. However, the extent to which host cell death is a proxy for disease resistance signaling has long been debated, as host cell death and pathogen growth restriction can be uncoupled in several cases. To assess the disease resistance activity of R proteins, bacterial growth assays have been employed in combination with transient R gene expression in N. benthamiana. Bacterial growth assays, however, require multiple experimental procedures, including agroinfiltration, pathogen infection and bacterial counts, which hinders high-throughput studies of R gene-mediated disease resistance. Here, we report a simple plate reader-based assay to assess R gene-mediated disease resistance activity against PVX (Potato virus X) that expresses YFP (PVX-YFP). Unlike bacterial pathogens, PVX proliferation in N. benthamiana is not restricted by the intrinsic activity of the EDS1 signaling pathway as previously shown by virus-induced NbEDS1 gene silencing and as we consistently show in this study using a Nbeds1 gene knockout mutant. This feature would increase the sensitivity of the assay, allowing it to capture a weak-to-moderate disease resistance activity of R proteins, as the contribution of basal immunity to PVX via the NbEDS1 pathway is negligible. Using this assay, we show that a non-cell death-inducing mutant of the R protein of RBA1 (Response to HopBA1), which lacks 2',3'-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activity but retains NADase activity, confers PVX resistance in an EDS1 signaling pathway-dependent manner.\nIntegration of shoot-derived polypeptide signals by root TGA transcription factors is essential for survival under fluctuating nitrogen environments\nAuthors: Kobayashi, R.; Ohkubo, Y.; Izumi, M.; Ota, R.; Yamada, K.; Hayashi, Y.; Yamashita, Y.; Noda, S.; Ogawa-Ohnishi, M.; Matsubayashi, Y.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563506\nUnlike plants in the field, which experience significant temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions, plants in the laboratory are typically grown in controlled, stable environments. Therefore, signaling pathways evolved for survival in continuously fluctuating environments often remain functionally latent in laboratory settings. Here, we show that TGA1 and TGA4 act as hub transcription factors through which the expression of genes involved in high-affinity nitrate uptake are regulated in response to shoot-derived phloem mobile polypeptides, CEP DOWNSTREAM 1 (CEPD1), CEPD2 and CEPD-like 2 (CEPDL2) as nitrogen (N) deficiency signals, and Glutaredoxin S1 (GrxS1) to GrxS8 as N sufficiency signals. CEPD1/2/CEPDL2 and GrxS1-S8 competitively bind to TGA1/4 in roots, with the former acting as transcription coactivators that enhance the uptake of nitrate, while the latter function as corepressor complexes together with TOPLESS to limit nitrate uptake. Arabidopsis plants deficient in TGA1/4 maintain basal nitrate uptake and exhibit growth similar to wild-type plants in a stable N environment, but were impaired in regulation of nitrate acquisition in response to shoot N demand, leading to defective growth under continuously fluctuating N environments where rhizosphere nitrate ions switch periodically between deficient and sufficient states. TGA1/4 are crucial transcription factors that enable plants to survive under fluctuating and challenging N environmental conditions.\nMinimized dark cataplerosis of the Calvin cycle ensures prompt photosynthetic initiation in cyanobacteria\nAuthors: Tanaka, K.; Kondo, A.; Hasunuma, T.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562951\nAs primary contributors to oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria intricately regulate their metabolic pathways during the diurnal cycle to ensure survival and growth. Under dark conditions, breakdown of stored energy reserves of glycogen replenishes the intermediates, especially the downstream glycolytic metabolites necessary for photosynthetic initiation upon light irradiation. The intracellular level of the intermediates is maintained throughout the dark period. However, it remains unclear how their accumulation is maintained in the dark despite the limited availability of glycogen. Here, we showed that the metabolite accumulation stability is ensured by the low activities of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) converting enzymes, namely PEP carboxylase and pyruvate kinase, during the dark period. Overexpression of these enzymes significantly decreased the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates after dark incubation. The oxygen evolution ability simultaneously decreased in the overexpressing strains, indicating that the dark limitation of the PEP-consuming pathway facilitates photosynthetic initiation through the maintenance of glycolytic intermediates. This finding shed light on the importance of controlling cataplerotic flux during the dark for maintaining stable operation of the Calvin cycle.\nMedicago truncatula SOBIR1 controls specificity in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis\nAuthors: Sarrette, B.; Luu, T.-B.; Johansson, A.; Fliegmann, J.; Pouzet, C.; Le Ru, A.; Pichereaux, C.; Rembliere, C.; Sauviac, L.; Carles, N.; Amblard, E.; Guyot, V.; Bonhomme, M.; Cullimore, J.; Gough, C.; Jacquet, C.; Pauly, N.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.561875\nMedicago truncatula Nod Factor Perception (MtNFP) is a lysin-domain Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) that plays a key role in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, and is involved in plant immunity. MtNFP also has an inactive kinase domain, suggesting that the protein is involved in different receptor complexes. Using the MtNFP pseudo-kinase domain as a bait in a Yeast two Hybrid screen, we identified M. truncatula SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 (MtSOBIR1) as a new interactor of MtNFP. We showed that an interaction between the two RLKs can occur in planta and that the kinase domain of MtSOBIR1 is active and can transphosphorylate the pseudo-kinase domain of MtNFP. Like in other plants, our data suggest a positive role of MtSOBIR1 in immunity; MtSOBIR1 could functionally complement an Atsobir1 mutant for defence activation, and a Mtsobir1 mutant was defective in pathogen-induced defence gene expression. We also showed that MtSOBIR1 has a symbiotic role with Mtsobir1 mutants showing a strong symbiotic phenotype in a plant genotype- and rhizobial strain-specific manner. The symbiotic role was apparent both at an early stage of rhizobial infection and in nodules. Together, these data suggest that, like MtNFP, MtSOBIR1 has a dual role, and can control immunity in both pathogenic and beneficial situations, with positive or negative roles, respectively.\nMultiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of rice PSBS1 non-coding sequences for transgene-free overexpression\nAuthors: Patel-Tupper, D.; Kelikian, A.; Leipertz, A.; Maryn, N.; Tjahjadi, M.; Karavolias, N. G.; Cho, M.-J.; Niyogi, K. K.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563333\nUnderstanding CRISPR/Cas9's capacity to generate native overexpression (OX) alleles would accelerate agronomic gains achievable by gene editing. To generate OX alleles with increased RNA and protein abundance, we leveraged multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of non-coding DNA sequences located upstream of the rice PSBS1 gene. We isolated 120 transgene-free, gene-edited alleles with varying NPQ capacity in vivo-- ranging from complete knockout to overexpression, using a high-throughput phenotyping and transgene screening pipeline. Overexpression of OsPSBS1 increased protein abundance 2-3-fold, matching fold changes obtained by transgenesis. Increased PsbS protein abundance enhanced non-photochemical quenching capacity and improved water-use efficiency. Across our resolved genetic variation, we identify the role of 5'UTR indels and inversions in driving knockout/knockdown and overexpression phenotypes, respectively. Complex structural variants, such as the 252kb duplication/inversion generated in this study, evidence the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 to facilitate significant genomic changes with negligible off-target transcriptomic perturbations. Our results may inform future gene-editing strategies for hypermorphic alleles and have opened the door to the pursuit of gene-edited, non-transgenic rice plants with accelerated relaxation of photoprotection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Filamentous plant pathogens deliver effector proteins into host cells to suppress host defence responses and manipulate metabolic processes to support colonization. Understanding the evolution and molecular function of these effectors provides knowledge about pathogenesis and can suggest novel strategies to reduce damage caused by pathogens. However, effector proteins are highly variable, share weak sequence similarity and, although they can be grouped according to their structure, only a few structurally conserved effector families have been functionally characterized to date. Here, we demonstrate that Zinc-finger fold (ZiF) secreted proteins form a functionally diverse effector family in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. This family relies on the Zinc-finger motif for protein stability and is ubiquitously present, forming different effector tribes in blast fungus lineages infecting 13 different host species. Homologs of the canonical ZiF effector, AVR-Pii from rice infecting isolates, are present in multiple M. oryzae lineages, and the wheat infecting strains of the fungus, for example, possess an allele that also binds host Exo70 proteins and activates the immune receptor Pii. Furthermore, ZiF tribes vary in the host Exo70 proteins they bind, indicating functional diversification and an intricate effector/host interactome. Altogether, we uncovered a new effector family with a common protein fold that has functionally diversified in lineages of M. oryzae. This work expands our understanding of the diversity of M. oryzae effectors, the molecular basis of plant pathogenesis and may ultimately facilitate the development of new sources for pathogen resistance.

Author SummaryDiseases caused by filamentous plant pathogens impact global food production, leading to severe economic and humanitarian consequences. These pathogens secrete hundreds of effectors inside the host to alter cellular processes and to promote infection and disease. Effector proteins have weak or no sequence similarity but can be grouped in structural families based on conserved protein folds. However, very few conserved effector families have been functionally characterized. We have identified a family of effectors with a shared Zinc-finger protein fold (ZiF) that is present in lineages of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that can, collectively, infect 13 different grasses. We characterized the binding of a sub-set of these proteins to putative Exo70 host targets and showed they can be recognized by the plant immune system. Furthermore, we show that other ZiF effectors do not bind Exo70 targets, suggesting functional specialization within this effector family for alternative interactors. These findings shed light on the diversity of effectors and their molecular functions, as well as potentially leading to the development of new sources of blast disease resistance in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing) proteins can form complex receptor networks to confer innate immunity. NRCs are phylogenetically related nodes that function downstream of a massively expanded network of disease resistance proteins that protect against multiple plant pathogens. Here, we used phylogenomic methods to reconstruct the macroevolution of the NRC family. One of the NRCs, we termed NRC0, is the only family member shared across asterid plants, leading us to investigate its evolutionary history and genetic organization. In several asterid species, NRC0 is genetically clustered to other NLRs that are phylogenetically related to NRC-dependent disease resistance genes. This prompted us to hypothesize that the ancestral state of the NRC network is an NLR helper-sensor gene cluster that was present early during asterid evolution. We validated this hypothesis by demonstrating that NRC0 is essential for the hypersensitive cell death induced by its genetically linked sensor NLR partners in four divergent asterid species: tomato, wild sweet potato, coffee and carrot. In addition, activation of a sensor NLR leads to high-order complex formation of its genetically linked NRC0 similar to other NRCs. Our findings map out contrasting evolutionary dynamics in the macroevolution of the NRC network over the last 125 million years from a functionally conserved NLR gene cluster to a massive genetically dispersed network.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The molecular mechanisms guiding oriented cell divisions in the root vascular tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana are still poorly characterized. By overlapping bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we unveiled TETRASPANIN1 (TET1) as a putative regulator in this process. TET1 is expressed in root vascular cells and loss-of-function mutants contain fewer vascular cells files. We further generated and characterized a CRISPR deletion mutant and show, unlike previously described mutants, that the full knock out is additionally missing endodermal cells in a stochastic way. Finally, we show that HA-tagged versions of TET1 are functional in contrast to fluorescent TET1 translational fusions. Immunostaining using HA-TET1 lines complementing the mutant phenotype revealed a dual plasma membrane and intracellular localization in the root vasculature and a polar membrane localization in young cortex, endodermal and initial cells. Taken together, we show that TET1 is involved in both vascular proliferation and ground tissue patterning. Our initial results pave the way for future work into deciphering its precise mode of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants possess cell surface-localized immune receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate defenses that provide effective resistance against microbial pathogens. Many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) limits pathogen growth in plants is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against P. syringae. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant innate immunity. Given the important role for amino acids as nutrients for microbial growth, their depletion at sites of infection may be a broadly effective means for defense against many pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity.

        <p class="abstract">R (resistance) proteins, such as intracellular NLRs (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors), are integral components of the plant innate immune system. Host responses following R protein activation include the generation of reactive oxygen species, sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2&#43;, transcriptional reprogramming and, typically, rapid host cell death at sites of pathogen infection, which together ultimately lead to pathogen growth restriction. To assess the activity of R proteins, agroinfiltration-mediated transient gene expression assays have been widely used in Nicotiana species (e.g., N. benthamiana). In these transient assays, host cell death is often chosen as an indicator of R protein activity from the host responses mentioned above, in part because of the ease of experimentation. However, the extent to which host cell death is a proxy for disease resistance signaling has long been debated, as host cell death and pathogen growth restriction can be uncoupled in several cases. To assess the disease resistance activity of R proteins, bacterial growth assays have been employed in combination with transient R gene expression in N. benthamiana. Bacterial growth assays, however, require multiple experimental procedures, including agroinfiltration, pathogen infection and bacterial counts, which hinders high-throughput studies of R gene-mediated disease resistance. Here, we report a simple plate reader-based assay to assess R gene-mediated disease resistance activity against PVX (Potato virus X) that expresses YFP (PVX-YFP). Unlike bacterial pathogens, PVX proliferation in N. benthamiana is not restricted by the intrinsic activity of the EDS1 signaling pathway as previously shown by virus-induced NbEDS1 gene silencing and as we consistently show in this study using a Nbeds1 gene knockout mutant. This feature would increase the sensitivity of the assay, allowing it to capture a weak-to-moderate disease resistance activity of R proteins, as the contribution of basal immunity to PVX via the NbEDS1 pathway is negligible. Using this assay, we show that a non-cell death-inducing mutant of the R protein of RBA1 (Response to HopBA1), which lacks 2&#39;,3&#39;-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activity but retains NADase activity, confers PVX resistance in an EDS1 signaling pathway-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unlike plants in the field, which experience significant temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions, plants in the laboratory are typically grown in controlled, stable environments. Therefore, signaling pathways evolved for survival in continuously fluctuating environments often remain functionally latent in laboratory settings. Here, we show that TGA1 and TGA4 act as hub transcription factors through which the expression of genes involved in high-affinity nitrate uptake are regulated in response to shoot-derived phloem mobile polypeptides, CEP DOWNSTREAM 1 (CEPD1), CEPD2 and CEPD-like 2 (CEPDL2) as nitrogen (N) deficiency signals, and Glutaredoxin S1 (GrxS1) to GrxS8 as N sufficiency signals. CEPD1/2/CEPDL2 and GrxS1-S8 competitively bind to TGA1/4 in roots, with the former acting as transcription coactivators that enhance the uptake of nitrate, while the latter function as corepressor complexes together with TOPLESS to limit nitrate uptake. Arabidopsis plants deficient in TGA1/4 maintain basal nitrate uptake and exhibit growth similar to wild-type plants in a stable N environment, but were impaired in regulation of nitrate acquisition in response to shoot N demand, leading to defective growth under continuously fluctuating N environments where rhizosphere nitrate ions switch periodically between deficient and sufficient states. TGA1/4 are crucial transcription factors that enable plants to survive under fluctuating and challenging N environmental conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As primary contributors to oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria intricately regulate their metabolic pathways during the diurnal cycle to ensure survival and growth. Under dark conditions, breakdown of stored energy reserves of glycogen replenishes the intermediates, especially the downstream glycolytic metabolites necessary for photosynthetic initiation upon light irradiation. The intracellular level of the intermediates is maintained throughout the dark period. However, it remains unclear how their accumulation is maintained in the dark despite the limited availability of glycogen. Here, we showed that the metabolite accumulation stability is ensured by the low activities of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) converting enzymes, namely PEP carboxylase and pyruvate kinase, during the dark period. Overexpression of these enzymes significantly decreased the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates after dark incubation. The oxygen evolution ability simultaneously decreased in the overexpressing strains, indicating that the dark limitation of the PEP-consuming pathway facilitates photosynthetic initiation through the maintenance of glycolytic intermediates. This finding shed light on the importance of controlling cataplerotic flux during the dark for maintaining stable operation of the Calvin cycle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medicago truncatula Nod Factor Perception (MtNFP) is a lysin-domain Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) that plays a key role in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, and is involved in plant immunity. MtNFP also has an inactive kinase domain, suggesting that the protein is involved in different receptor complexes. Using the MtNFP pseudo-kinase domain as a bait in a Yeast two Hybrid screen, we identified M. truncatula SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 (MtSOBIR1) as a new interactor of MtNFP. We showed that an interaction between the two RLKs can occur in planta and that the kinase domain of MtSOBIR1 is active and can transphosphorylate the pseudo-kinase domain of MtNFP. Like in other plants, our data suggest a positive role of MtSOBIR1 in immunity; MtSOBIR1 could functionally complement an Atsobir1 mutant for defence activation, and a Mtsobir1 mutant was defective in pathogen-induced defence gene expression. We also showed that MtSOBIR1 has a symbiotic role with Mtsobir1 mutants showing a strong symbiotic phenotype in a plant genotype- and rhizobial strain-specific manner. The symbiotic role was apparent both at an early stage of rhizobial infection and in nodules. Together, these data suggest that, like MtNFP, MtSOBIR1 has a dual role, and can control immunity in both pathogenic and beneficial situations, with positive or negative roles, respectively.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding CRISPR/Cas9&#39;s capacity to generate native overexpression (OX) alleles would accelerate agronomic gains achievable by gene editing. To generate OX alleles with increased RNA and protein abundance, we leveraged multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of non-coding DNA sequences located upstream of the rice PSBS1 gene. We isolated 120 transgene-free, gene-edited alleles with varying NPQ capacity in vivo-- ranging from complete knockout to overexpression, using a high-throughput phenotyping and transgene screening pipeline. Overexpression of OsPSBS1 increased protein abundance 2-3-fold, matching fold changes obtained by transgenesis. Increased PsbS protein abundance enhanced non-photochemical quenching capacity and improved water-use efficiency. Across our resolved genetic variation, we identify the role of 5&#39;UTR indels and inversions in driving knockout/knockdown and overexpression phenotypes, respectively. Complex structural variants, such as the 252kb duplication/inversion generated in this study, evidence the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 to facilitate significant genomic changes with negligible off-target transcriptomic perturbations. Our results may inform future gene-editing strategies for hypermorphic alleles and have opened the door to the pursuit of gene-edited, non-transgenic rice plants with accelerated relaxation of photoprotection.</p>
