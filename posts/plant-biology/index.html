These fluxes are often considered passive by-products of development and their patterning and potential contribution to morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we generated a complete map of cell volumetric growth and deformation across the shoot apex in Arabidopsis thaliana. Within the organ-meristem boundary, we found that a subpopulation of cells next to fast-growing cells experiences volumetric shrinkage. To understand this process, we used a vertex-based model integrating mechanics and hydraulics, informed by the measured growth rates. Organ outgrowth simulations revealed the emerging water fluxes and predicted water deficit with volume loss for a few cells at the boundary. Consistently, in planta, a water-soluble dye is preferentially allocated to fast-growing tissues and fails to enter the boundary domain. Analysis of intact meristems further validated our model by revealing cell shrinkage next to fast-growing cells in different contexts of tissue surface curvature and cell deformation. A molecular signature of water deficit at the boundary further confirmed our conclusion. Taken together, we propose a model where the differential sink strength of emerging organs prescribes the hydraulic patterns that define the boundary domain at the shoot apex.\nUncovering the Infection Strategy of Phyllachora maydis during Maize Colonization: A Comprehensive Analysis\nAuthors: Caldwell, D. L.; Da Silva, C. R.; McCoy, A. G.; Avila, H.; Bonkowski, J. C.; Chilvers, M.; Helm, M.; Telenko, D. E.; Iyer-Pascuzzi, A. S.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554799\nTar spot, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungal pathogen Phyllachora maydis, is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of maize (Zea mays L.) within the United States. P. maydis may also be found in association with other fungi, forming a disease complex with characteristic fish eye lesions. Understanding how P. maydis colonizes maize leaf cells is essential for developing effective disease control strategies. Here, we used histological approaches to elucidate how P. maydis infects and multiplies within susceptible maize leaves. We collected tar spot-infected maize leaf samples from four different fields in northern Indiana at three different time points during the growing season. Samples were chemically fixed and paraffin-embedded for high-resolution light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed a consistent pattern of disease progression in independent leaf samples collected across different geographical regions. Each stromata contained a central pycnidium that produced asexual spores. Perithecia with sexual spores developed in the stomatal chambers adjacent to the pycnidia, and a cap of spores formed over the stromata. P. maydis reproductive structures formed around but not within the vasculature. In our samples containing fish eye lesions, P. maydis is associated with two additional fungi, one of which is likely a member of the Paraphaeospheria genus; the other is an unknown fungi. Our data provide fundamental insights into how this pathogen colonizes and spreads within maize leaves. This knowledge can inform new approaches to managing tar spot, which could help mitigate the significant economic losses caused by this disease.\nRapid redirection of auxin fluxes during root gravitropism by translocation of NGR proteins driving polarization of PIN-activating kinases\nAuthors: Kulich, I.; Schmid, J.; Teplova, A.; Qi, L.; Friml, J.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555533\nRoot gravitropic bending represents a fundamental aspect of terrestrial plant physiology. Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.\nComparative GWAS identifies a role for Mendel green pea gene in the nonphotochemical quenching kinetics of sorghum, maize, and arabidopsis\nAuthors: Sahay, S.; Shrestha, N.; Dias, H. M.; Mural, R. V.; Grzybowski, M.; Schnable, J. C.; Glowacka, K.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555201\nPhotosynthetic organisms must cope with rapid fluctuations in light intensity. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) enables the dissipation of excess light energy as heat under high light conditions, whereas its relaxation under low light maximizes photosynthetic productivity. We quantified variation in NPQ kinetics across a large sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) association panel in four environments, uncovering significant genetic control for NPQ. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 20 unique regions in the sorghum genome associated with NPQ. We detected strong signals from the sorghum ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) involved in plastid nucleus signaling and tolerance to cold. By integrating GWAS results for NPQ across maize (Zea mays) and sorghum association panels, we identified a second gene, NON-YELLOWING 1 (NYE1), originally identified by Gregor Mendel in pea (Pisum sativum) and involved in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes, along with OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 37 (OEP37), that encodes a transporter in chloroplast envelope. Analysis of nye1 insertion alleles in A. thaliana confirmed the effect of this gene on NPQ kinetics across monocots and eudicots. We extended our comparative genomics GWAS framework across the entire maize and sorghum genomes, identifying four additional loci involved in NPQ kinetics. These results provide a baseline for engineering crops with improved NPQ kinetics and increasing the accuracy and speed of candidate gene identification for GWAS in species with high linkage disequilibrium.\nA low-cost and open-source imaging platform reveals spatiotemporal insight into Arabidopsis leaf elongation and movement\nAuthors: Oskam, L.; Snoek, B. L.; Pantazopoulou, C. K.; van Veen, H.; Matton, S. E. A.; Dijkhuizen, R. F.; Pierik, R.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554752\nPlant organs move throughout the diurnal cycle, changing leaf and petiole positions to balance light capture, leaf temperature and water loss under dynamic environmental conditions. Upward movement of the petiole, called hyponasty, is one of several traits of the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). SAS traits are elicited upon perception of vegetation shade signals such as far-red light (FR) and improve light capture in dense vegetation. Monitoring plant movement at a high temporal resolution allows studying functionality, as well as molecular regulation of hyponasty. However, high temporal resolution imaging solutions are often very expensive, making this unavailable to many researchers. Here, we present a modular and low-cost imaging set-up, based on small Raspberry Pi computers, that can track leaf movements and elongation growth with high temporal resolution. We also developed an open-source, semi-automated image analysis pipeline. Using this setup we followed responses to FR enrichment, light intensity and their interactions. Tracking both elongation and angle of petiole, lamina and entire leaf revealed insight into R:FR sensitivities of leaf growth and movement dynamics, and its interactions with background light intensity. We also identified spatial separation in hyponastic response regulation for the petiole and the lamina of the leaf, depending on the light conditions.\nInsights into Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions\nAuthors: Qi, M.; Yu, H.; Bredow, M.; Chicowski, A. S.; Fields, L. D.; Whitham, S. A.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555440\nThe multifaceted role of pathogen-encoded effectors in plant-pathogen interactions is complex and not fully understood. Effectors operate within intricate host environments, interacting with host proteins and other effectors to modulate virulence. The complex interplay between effectors raises the concept of metaeffectors, where some effectors regulate the activity of others. While previous research has demonstrated the importance of effector repertoires in pathogen virulence, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interactions between these effectors. This study explores the interactions among Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector candidates (PpECs). P. pachyrhizi haustorial transcriptome analysis identified a collection of predicted PpECs. Among these, PpEC23 was found to interact with PpEC48, prompting further exploration into their potential interaction with other effectors. Here, we utilized a yeast-two-hybrid screen to explore protein-protein interactions between PpECs. A split-luciferase complementation assay also demonstrated that these interactions could occur within soybean cells. Interestingly, PpEC48 displayed the ability to interact with several small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRP), suggesting its affinity for this specific class of effectors. We show that these interactions involve a histidine-rich domain within PpEC48, emphasizing the significance of structural motifs in mediating effector interactions. The unique nature of PpEC48, showing no sequence matches in other organisms, suggests its relatively recent evolution and potential orphan gene status. Our work reveals insights into the intricate network of interactions among P. pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions.\nIsoform-resolved genome annotation enables mapping of tissue-specific betalain regulation and anthocyanin regulator co-option in amaranth\nAuthors: Winkler, T. S.; Vollmer, S. K.; Stetter, M. G.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554588\nO_LIBetalains are coloring pigments produced only in some families of the order Caryophyllales, where they have functionally replaced anthocyanins as coloring pigments. While the betalain pathway itself is known, the tissue-specific regulation of the pathway remains mostly unclear. C_LIO_LIWe first improve the high-quality Amaranthus hypochondriacus reference genome and create a highly complete genome annotation by combining ab initio prediction with long-read isoform sequencing data. We accurately annotate the betalain and anthocyanin pathway genes and their regulators in the genome of the betalain producing amaranth and further map the genetic basis of tissue color and tissue-specific regulation of the betalain pathway through a previously unknown MYB transcription factor, AhMYB2. C_LIO_LIDetailed haplotype analysis enabled us to identify two functional mutations that lead to a knock-out of the betalain pathway in natural accessions of amaranth. In addition, the down-regulation of AhMYB2 in the flower leads to reduced expression of key betalain enzyme genes and loss of red flower color. C_LIO_LIOur improved amaranth reference genome represents the most complete genome of amaranth to date and is a valuable resource for betalain and amaranth research. The high similarity of the betalain flower regulator AhMYB2 to anthocyanin regulators and a partially conserved interaction motif support the co-option of anthocyanin regulators for the betalain pathway as possible reason for the mutually exclusive nature of the two pigments. C_LI\nFungal hacking of the plant sex-determination pathway via interference with AGL24 in Silene latifolia\nAuthors: Fujita, N.; Hood, M. E.; Komoda, Y.; Akagi, T.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555088\nPlants have evolved lineage-specific sex-determination systems that is determined not only by genetic factors, but also the surrounding environmental conditions, including interactions with pathogens. Silene latifolia is a model dioecious plant whose sexuality is genetically regulated by X/Y chromosomes; however, anther smut fungus mimics the plant Y chromosome and forcibly converts female plants to male. Here, transcriptome analyses of healthy or fungus-infected S. latifolia inflorescence meristems suggested that an orthologue of AGL24 (SlAGL24), a flowering activator, is a key factor in sex conversion via fungus infection. Overexpression of SlAGL24 in Arabidopsis thaliana suppressed stamen development, whereas knock-down of SlAGL24 in S. latifolia converted males into hermaphrodites. Furthermore, SlAGL24 expression affected sexual dimorphisms in S. latifolia. Our results propose an adaptive scenario wherein the anther smut fungus targets SlAGL24, as a master regulator connecting the fungal signal to sex determination, to confer male and potentially male-beneficial traits, effectively transmitting its teliospores.\nHeterochromatin re-organization associated with the transcriptional reprogramming under viral infection in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Annacondia, M. L.; Juarez-Gonzalez, V. T.; Cheng, J.; Reig-Valiente, J. L.; Martinez, G.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555647\nEpigenetic mechanisms are key regulators of genomic integrity and genic expression. Emerging evidence shows that epigenetic regulation is an important component of the transcriptional reprogramming during stress. Despite this, the overall stress-induced reprogramming of the different epigenetic marks and their targets are unknown. Here, we uncovered multiple epigenetic changes taking place during viral infection in Arabidopsis thaliana and their connection with gene expression. We find that cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection induces an overall reorganization of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, which interact between them and are dynamic during infection. Overall, these epigenetic changes are involved in the reprogramming of the transcriptional program to adapt to the biotic stress, and might ensure genome stability through the transcriptional control of transposable elements (TEs). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) CURLY LEAF (CLF) mediates the transcriptional repression of genes gaining H3K27me3 during viral infection and that mutants on that component induce resistance against CMV. Altogether, our results provide a complete picture of the epigenetic changes that occur during biotic stress and exemplify the overall dynamism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic organisms.\nUpstream regulator of genomic imprinting in rice endosperm is a small RNA-associated chromatin remodeler\nAuthors: Pal, A.; Sundar, V. H.; Nambiar, A.; Shivaprasad, P. V.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555833\nGenomic imprinting is observed in endosperm, a placenta-like seed tissue, where transposable elements (TEs) and repeat-derived small(s)RNAs mediate epigenetic changes in plants. In imprinting, uniparental gene expression arises due to parent-specific epigenetic marks on one allele but not on the other. The importance of sRNAs and their regulation in endosperm development or in imprinting is poorly understood in crops. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized CLASSY (CLSY)-family chromatin remodeler named OsCLSY3 is essential for rice endosperm development and imprinting, acting as an upstream player in sRNA pathway. Comparative transcriptome and genetic analysis indicated its endosperm-preferred expression and its paternally imprinted nature. These important features were modulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of tandemly arranged TEs in its promoter. Upon perturbation of OsCLSY3 in transgenic lines we observed defects in endosperm development and loss of around 70% of all sRNAs. Interestingly, well-conserved endosperm-specific sRNAs (siren) that are vital for reproductive fitness in angiosperms were dependent on OsCLSY3. We also observed many imprinted genes and seed development-associated genes under the control of CLSY3-dependent RdDM. These results support an essential role of OsCLSY3 in rice endosperm development and imprinting, and propose similar regulatory strategies involving CLSY3 homologs among other cereals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In multicellular organisms, localized tissue outgrowth creates a new water sink thereby modifying hydraulic patterns at the organ level. These fluxes are often considered passive by-products of development and their patterning and potential contribution to morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we generated a complete map of cell volumetric growth and deformation across the shoot apex in Arabidopsis thaliana. Within the organ-meristem boundary, we found that a subpopulation of cells next to fast-growing cells experiences volumetric shrinkage. To understand this process, we used a vertex-based model integrating mechanics and hydraulics, informed by the measured growth rates. Organ outgrowth simulations revealed the emerging water fluxes and predicted water deficit with volume loss for a few cells at the boundary. Consistently, in planta, a water-soluble dye is preferentially allocated to fast-growing tissues and fails to enter the boundary domain. Analysis of intact meristems further validated our model by revealing cell shrinkage next to fast-growing cells in different contexts of tissue surface curvature and cell deformation. A molecular signature of water deficit at the boundary further confirmed our conclusion. Taken together, we propose a model where the differential sink strength of emerging organs prescribes the hydraulic patterns that define the boundary domain at the shoot apex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tar spot, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungal pathogen Phyllachora maydis, is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of maize (Zea mays L.) within the United States. P. maydis may also be found in association with other fungi, forming a disease complex with characteristic fish eye lesions. Understanding how P. maydis colonizes maize leaf cells is essential for developing effective disease control strategies. Here, we used histological approaches to elucidate how P. maydis infects and multiplies within susceptible maize leaves. We collected tar spot-infected maize leaf samples from four different fields in northern Indiana at three different time points during the growing season. Samples were chemically fixed and paraffin-embedded for high-resolution light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed a consistent pattern of disease progression in independent leaf samples collected across different geographical regions. Each stromata contained a central pycnidium that produced asexual spores. Perithecia with sexual spores developed in the stomatal chambers adjacent to the pycnidia, and a cap of spores formed over the stromata. P. maydis reproductive structures formed around but not within the vasculature. In our samples containing fish eye lesions, P. maydis is associated with two additional fungi, one of which is likely a member of the Paraphaeospheria genus; the other is an unknown fungi. Our data provide fundamental insights into how this pathogen colonizes and spreads within maize leaves. This knowledge can inform new approaches to managing tar spot, which could help mitigate the significant economic losses caused by this disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Root gravitropic bending represents a fundamental aspect of terrestrial plant physiology. Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Photosynthetic organisms must cope with rapid fluctuations in light intensity. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) enables the dissipation of excess light energy as heat under high light conditions, whereas its relaxation under low light maximizes photosynthetic productivity. We quantified variation in NPQ kinetics across a large sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) association panel in four environments, uncovering significant genetic control for NPQ. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 20 unique regions in the sorghum genome associated with NPQ. We detected strong signals from the sorghum ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) involved in plastid nucleus signaling and tolerance to cold. By integrating GWAS results for NPQ across maize (Zea mays) and sorghum association panels, we identified a second gene, NON-YELLOWING 1 (NYE1), originally identified by Gregor Mendel in pea (Pisum sativum) and involved in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes, along with OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 37 (OEP37), that encodes a transporter in chloroplast envelope. Analysis of nye1 insertion alleles in A. thaliana confirmed the effect of this gene on NPQ kinetics across monocots and eudicots. We extended our comparative genomics GWAS framework across the entire maize and sorghum genomes, identifying four additional loci involved in NPQ kinetics. These results provide a baseline for engineering crops with improved NPQ kinetics and increasing the accuracy and speed of candidate gene identification for GWAS in species with high linkage disequilibrium.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant organs move throughout the diurnal cycle, changing leaf and petiole positions to balance light capture, leaf temperature and water loss under dynamic environmental conditions. Upward movement of the petiole, called hyponasty, is one of several traits of the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). SAS traits are elicited upon perception of vegetation shade signals such as far-red light (FR) and improve light capture in dense vegetation. Monitoring plant movement at a high temporal resolution allows studying functionality, as well as molecular regulation of hyponasty. However, high temporal resolution imaging solutions are often very expensive, making this unavailable to many researchers. Here, we present a modular and low-cost imaging set-up, based on small Raspberry Pi computers, that can track leaf movements and elongation growth with high temporal resolution. We also developed an open-source, semi-automated image analysis pipeline. Using this setup we followed responses to FR enrichment, light intensity and their interactions. Tracking both elongation and angle of petiole, lamina and entire leaf revealed insight into R:FR sensitivities of leaf growth and movement dynamics, and its interactions with background light intensity. We also identified spatial separation in hyponastic response regulation for the petiole and the lamina of the leaf, depending on the light conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The multifaceted role of pathogen-encoded effectors in plant-pathogen interactions is complex and not fully understood. Effectors operate within intricate host environments, interacting with host proteins and other effectors to modulate virulence. The complex interplay between effectors raises the concept of metaeffectors, where some effectors regulate the activity of others. While previous research has demonstrated the importance of effector repertoires in pathogen virulence, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interactions between these effectors. This study explores the interactions among Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector candidates (PpECs). P. pachyrhizi haustorial transcriptome analysis identified a collection of predicted PpECs. Among these, PpEC23 was found to interact with PpEC48, prompting further exploration into their potential interaction with other effectors. Here, we utilized a yeast-two-hybrid screen to explore protein-protein interactions between PpECs. A split-luciferase complementation assay also demonstrated that these interactions could occur within soybean cells. Interestingly, PpEC48 displayed the ability to interact with several small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRP), suggesting its affinity for this specific class of effectors. We show that these interactions involve a histidine-rich domain within PpEC48, emphasizing the significance of structural motifs in mediating effector interactions. The unique nature of PpEC48, showing no sequence matches in other organisms, suggests its relatively recent evolution and potential orphan gene status. Our work reveals insights into the intricate network of interactions among P. pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIBetalains are coloring pigments produced only in some families of the order Caryophyllales, where they have functionally replaced anthocyanins as coloring pigments. While the betalain pathway itself is known, the tissue-specific regulation of the pathway remains mostly unclear.
C_LIO_LIWe first improve the high-quality Amaranthus hypochondriacus reference genome and create a highly complete genome annotation by combining ab initio prediction with long-read isoform sequencing data. We accurately annotate the betalain and anthocyanin pathway genes and their regulators in the genome of the betalain producing amaranth and further map the genetic basis of tissue color and tissue-specific regulation of the betalain pathway through a previously unknown MYB transcription factor, AhMYB2.
C_LIO_LIDetailed haplotype analysis enabled us to identify two functional mutations that lead to a knock-out of the betalain pathway in natural accessions of amaranth. In addition, the down-regulation of AhMYB2 in the flower leads to reduced expression of key betalain enzyme genes and loss of red flower color.
C_LIO_LIOur improved amaranth reference genome represents the most complete genome of amaranth to date and is a valuable resource for betalain and amaranth research. The high similarity of the betalain flower regulator AhMYB2 to anthocyanin regulators and a partially conserved interaction motif support the co-option of anthocyanin regulators for the betalain pathway as possible reason for the mutually exclusive nature of the two pigments.

        <p class="abstract">Plants have evolved lineage-specific sex-determination systems that is determined not only by genetic factors, but also the surrounding environmental conditions, including interactions with pathogens. Silene latifolia is a model dioecious plant whose sexuality is genetically regulated by X/Y chromosomes; however, anther smut fungus mimics the plant Y chromosome and forcibly converts female plants to male. Here, transcriptome analyses of healthy or fungus-infected S. latifolia inflorescence meristems suggested that an orthologue of AGL24 (SlAGL24), a flowering activator, is a key factor in sex conversion via fungus infection. Overexpression of SlAGL24 in Arabidopsis thaliana suppressed stamen development, whereas knock-down of SlAGL24 in S. latifolia converted males into hermaphrodites. Furthermore, SlAGL24 expression affected sexual dimorphisms in S. latifolia. Our results propose an adaptive scenario wherein the anther smut fungus targets SlAGL24, as a master regulator connecting the fungal signal to sex determination, to confer male and potentially male-beneficial traits, effectively transmitting its teliospores.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epigenetic mechanisms are key regulators of genomic integrity and genic expression. Emerging evidence shows that epigenetic regulation is an important component of the transcriptional reprogramming during stress. Despite this, the overall stress-induced reprogramming of the different epigenetic marks and their targets are unknown. Here, we uncovered multiple epigenetic changes taking place during viral infection in Arabidopsis thaliana and their connection with gene expression. We find that cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection induces an overall reorganization of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, which interact between them and are dynamic during infection. Overall, these epigenetic changes are involved in the reprogramming of the transcriptional program to adapt to the biotic stress, and might ensure genome stability through the transcriptional control of transposable elements (TEs). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) CURLY LEAF (CLF) mediates the transcriptional repression of genes gaining H3K27me3 during viral infection and that mutants on that component induce resistance against CMV. Altogether, our results provide a complete picture of the epigenetic changes that occur during biotic stress and exemplify the overall dynamism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic imprinting is observed in endosperm, a placenta-like seed tissue, where transposable elements (TEs) and repeat-derived small(s)RNAs mediate epigenetic changes in plants. In imprinting, uniparental gene expression arises due to parent-specific epigenetic marks on one allele but not on the other. The importance of sRNAs and their regulation in endosperm development or in imprinting is poorly understood in crops. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized CLASSY (CLSY)-family chromatin remodeler named OsCLSY3 is essential for rice endosperm development and imprinting, acting as an upstream player in sRNA pathway. Comparative transcriptome and genetic analysis indicated its endosperm-preferred expression and its paternally imprinted nature. These important features were modulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of tandemly arranged TEs in its promoter. Upon perturbation of OsCLSY3 in transgenic lines we observed defects in endosperm development and loss of around 70% of all sRNAs. Interestingly, well-conserved endosperm-specific sRNAs (siren) that are vital for reproductive fitness in angiosperms were dependent on OsCLSY3. We also observed many imprinted genes and seed development-associated genes under the control of CLSY3-dependent RdDM. These results support an essential role of OsCLSY3 in rice endosperm development and imprinting, and propose similar regulatory strategies involving CLSY3 homologs among other cereals.</p>
