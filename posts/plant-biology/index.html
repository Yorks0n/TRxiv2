J.\nScore: 24.7, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550319\nPlant pathogens manipulate the cellular environment of the host to facilitate infection and colonization, often leading to plant diseases. To accomplish this, many specialized pathogens secrete virulence proteins called effectors into the host cell, which subvert processes such as immune signalling, gene transcription, and host metabolism. Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight, employs an expanded repertoire of RxLR effectors with WY domains to manipulate the host through direct interaction with protein targets. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between WY effectors and their host targets remains limited. In this study, we performed a structural and biophysical characterization of the P. infestans WY effector, Pi04314, in complex with the potato Protein Phosphatase 1-c (PP1c). We elucidate how Pi04314 uses a WY domain and a specialised C-terminal loop carrying a KVxF motif that interact with conserved surfaces on PP1c, known to be used by host regulatory proteins for guiding function. Through biophysical and in planta analyses, we demonstrate that Pi04314 WY or KVxF mutants lose their ability to bind PP1c. The loss of PP1c binding correlates with a reduced capacity to re-localize PP1c from the nucleolus and a decrease in lesion size in plant infection assays. This study provides insights into the manipulation of plant hosts by pathogens, revealing how effectors exploit key regulatory interfaces in host proteins to modify their function and facilitate disease.\nIdentification of cambium stem cell factors and their positioning mechanism\nAuthors: Eswaran, G.; Rutten, J.

P.\nScore: 31.7, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549889\nWood constitutes the majority of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TDIF ligand-activated PXY receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-dependent PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell.\nH2O2 sulfenylates CHE linking local infection to establishment of systemic acquired resistance\nAuthors: Cao, L.; Yoo, H.; Chen, T.; Mwimba, M.; Zhang, X.; Dong, X.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550865\nIn plants, a local infection can lead to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) through increased production of salicylic acid (SA). For 30 years, the identity of the mobile signal and its direct transduction mechanism for systemic SA synthesis in initiating SAR have been hotly debated. We found that, upon pathogen challenge, the cysteine residue of transcription factor CHE undergoes sulfenylation in systemic tissues, enhancing its binding to the promoter of SA-synthesis gene, ICS1, and increasing SA production. This occurs independently of previously reported pipecolic acid (Pip) signal. Instead, H2O2 produced by NADPH oxidase, RBOHD, is the mobile signal that sulfenylates CHE in a concentration-dependent manner. This modification serves as a molecular switch that activates CHE-mediated SA-increase and subsequent Pip-accumulation in systemic tissues to synergistically induce SAR.\nA Proxitome-RNA-capture Approach Reveals that Processing Bodies Repress Co-Regulated Hubs\nAuthors: Liu, C.; Mentzelopoulou, A.; Hatzianestis, I.; Tzagkarakis, E.; SKALTSOGIANNIS, V.; Ma, X.; Michalopoulou, V.

N.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550742\nCellular condensates can form ribonucleoprotein assemblies with liquid or solid-like properties. These properties and the lack of a delineating membrane, make the compositional determination of condensates laborious. Here to investigate the composition of the condensates known as processing bodies (PBs) in the model plant Arabidopsis we set up a pipeline for proximity-biotinylation-dependent capture of RNA. Using in situ protein-protein interaction approaches, RNA detection, in silico analyses, genetics, and high-resolution imaging, we systematically study PBs composition and dynamics. RNA recruitment and turnover in PBs depend on binding proteins, mRNA methylation, and liquid-to-solid phase transitions of PBs. Network analyses showed that RNAs and the corresponding encoded proteins co-assemble in PBs, with the main function to keep RNAs of certain pathways translationally repressed. The actin polymerization cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex, by dissolving liquid-like PBs at membrane interfaces allows the re-entry of mRNAs in the translational machinery. This de-repression adjusts ethylene signaling affecting development and stress. Heat stress imparts dissolution of PBs as they solidify, explaining why immunity or development under these conditions malfunction. This study reveals a mechanism for translational reprogramming important for development and adaptation, driven by the material properties of a condensate and membrane interfaces.\nDataPLAN: a web-based data management plan generator for the plant sciences\nAuthors: Zhou, X.-R.; Beier, S.; Brilhaus, D.; Rodrigues, C. M.; Mühlhaus, T.; von Suchodoletz, D.; Twyman, R. M.; Usadel, B.; Kranz, A.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548147\nResearch Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN - a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.\nSugar co-ordinates plant defence signalling\nAuthors: Yamada, K.; Mine, A.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549975\nRecognition of microbial molecules triggers energy-intensive defence systems. Although successful defence should therefore depend on energy availability, whether and, if so, how cellular metabolic information is molecularly input into defence remains unclear. We show that sugar, especially glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), plays a key role in regulating the types and amplitudes of defence outputs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under sugar-sufficient conditions, protein and phosphorylation levels of calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5) are elevated by induced expression and G6P-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases, priming defence responses. Furthermore, recognition of bacterial flagellin activates sugar transporters, leading to increased cellular G6P, which elicits CPK5-independent signalling promoting synthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) involved in anti-bacterial defence. In contrast, while perception of fungal chitin does not promote sugar influx or SA accumulation, chitin-induced synthesis of the anti-fungal compound camalexin requires basal sugar influx activity. These results suggest that, by monitoring G6P levels, plants determine defence priming levels and execute appropriate outputs against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Together, our findings provide a comprehensive view of the roles of sugar in plant defence.\nRAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR 22 is a key modulator of the proliferation and hyper-elongation responses of root hairs to microbial volatiles in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Leon Morcillo, R. J.; Leal-Lopez, J.; Lopez-Serrano, L.; Baroja-Fernandez, E.; Gamez-Arcas, S.; G. Doblas, V.; Ferez-Gomez, A.; Pozueta-Romero, J.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549818\nRAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides are important players in regulating cell expansion. In Arabidopsis, volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by the fungal phytopathogen Penicillium aurantiogriseum promote root hair (RH) proliferation and hyper-elongation through ethylene and enhanced photosynthesis signalling actions. A striking alteration in the proteome of fungal VC-treated roots involves up-regulation of RALF22. To test the possible involvement of RALF22 in the fungal VC-promoted RH changes, we characterized RH density and number responses to fungal VCs in ralf22 and fer-4 plants impaired in RALF22 and its receptor FERONIA, respectively. Unlike WT plants, ralf22 and fer-4 RHs responded weakly to fungal VCs, strongly indicating that the RALF22-FERONIA module is a key determinant of the RH response to fungal VCs. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms behind this response, we analysed the RALF22 transcript levels in roots of etr1-3 and eir1 ethylene signalling mutants and those of ethylene-responsive, RH-related RSL4, RHD2, PRX1 and PRX44 transcripts in ralf22 and fer-4 roots. Moreover, we characterized the RH and RALF22 transcript level responses to fungal VCs of the cfbp1 mutant defective in photosynthetic responsiveness to VCs. Unlike in WT roots, fungal VCs weakly enhanced RALF22 expression in etr1-3, eir1 and cfbp1 roots, and RSL4, RHD2, PRX1 and PRX44 expression in ralf22 and fer-4 roots. In addition, fungal VCs weakly promoted RH changes in cfbp1 roots. Collectively, our findings showed that the ethylene and enhanced photosynthesis signalling-mediated RH response to fungal VCs involves RALF22-FERONIA.\nThe transcriptome landscape of developing barley seeds reveals H3K27me3 dynamics in endosperm tissues\nAuthors: Kovacik, M.; Nowicka, A.; Zwyrtkov, J.; Strejckova, B.; Vardanega, I.; Esteban, E.

J.; Simon, R.; Pecinka, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550659\nCereal grains are an important food and feed. To provide comprehensive spatiotemporal information about biological processes in developing seeds of cultivated barley, we performed a transcriptomic study of the embryo, endosperm, and seed maternal tissues collected from 4 to 32 days after pollination. Weighted gene co-expression network and motif enrichment analyses pointed out specific groups of genes and transcription factors with possible impacts on regulating barley seed tissue development. We defined a set of tissue-specific marker genes and families of transcription factors for functional studies of the pathways controlling barley grain development. Assessment of selected groups of chromatin regulators revealed that epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and likely to play a major role during barley endosperm development. Repressive modification H3K27me3 is globally reduced in endosperm tissues and at specific developmental and storage compound genes. Altogether, this atlas uncovers the complexity of the developmental regulation of gene expression in barley grains. TeaserSpatiotemporal profiling of developing barley seeds revealed loss of H3K27me3 and changes in gene expression in endosperm.\nTemperature acclimation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism are related to the geographical origin of Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Hernandez, J. S.; Dziubek, D.; Schroeder, L.; Seydel, C.; Kitashova, A.; Brodsky, V.; Naegele, T.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549837\nAcclimation is a multigenic trait by which plants adjust photosynthesis and metabolism to cope with a changing environment. Here, natural variation of photosynthetic and metabolic acclimation was analyzed in response to low and elevated temperature. For this, 18 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, originating from Africa and Europe, were grown at 22{degrees}C before being exposed to 4{degrees}C and 34{degrees}C for cold and heat acclimation, respectively. Amounts of carbohydrates were quantified together with their subcellular distribution across plastids, cytosol and vacuole. Linear electron transport rates (ETRs) were determined together with maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) for all growth conditions and under temperature fluctuation. Under elevated temperature, residuals of ETR under increasing photosynthetic photon flux densities were found to significantly correlate with the longitudinal gradient of the geographic origin of accessions indicating a naturally occurring east-west gradient of photosynthetic acclimation capacities. Further, in heat acclimated plants, vacuolar fructose amount was found to positively correlate with longitude while plastidial and cytosolic amounts were found to be negatively correlated. Plastidial sucrose concentrations were found to positively correlate with maximal ETRs under fluctuating temperature indicating a stabilizing role within the chloroplast. In summary, our findings revealed specific subcellular carbohydrate distributions which contribute differentially to photosynthetic efficiencies of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions across a longitudinal gradient. This sheds light on the relevance of subcellular metabolic regulation for photosynthetic performance in a fluctuating environment and supports the physiological interpretation of naturally occurring genetic variation of temperature tolerance and acclimation.\nMonitoring single root hairs using a micro-chambered hydroponics system MiCHy reveals a new mode of action of the aminosteroid U73122\nAuthors: Shikata, H.; Sato, Y.; Schwechheimer, C.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549431\nWhen using chemical probes and inhibitors for cell biological studies, the uniform and rapid access of the chemical to the sample is key for the accuracy of the analysis. Until now, however, this could only be accomplished by using expensive equipment and labor-intensive and often lengthy procedures. Here, we introduce MiCHy, a micro-chambered hydroponics system, as an accessible and versatile method for chemical treatments and demonstrate its use for imaging roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, the major model system for plant cell biological research. Using lipid biosensors in combination with established chemicals, such as the phosphoinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitor phenylarsine oxide and the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor U73122, we demonstrate the suitability of MiCHy for studying the relationship between growth and lipid dynamics in root hairs. We further reveal novel effects of U73122 on the plasma membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 3 (PIP5K3), which is the first evidence demonstrating a role for U73122 besides its role as a PI-PLC inhibitor in plants.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Plant pathogens manipulate the cellular environment of the host to facilitate infection and colonization, often leading to plant diseases. To accomplish this, many specialized pathogens secrete virulence proteins called effectors into the host cell, which subvert processes such as immune signalling, gene transcription, and host metabolism. Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight, employs an expanded repertoire of RxLR effectors with WY domains to manipulate the host through direct interaction with protein targets. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between WY effectors and their host targets remains limited. In this study, we performed a structural and biophysical characterization of the P. infestans WY effector, Pi04314, in complex with the potato Protein Phosphatase 1-c (PP1c). We elucidate how Pi04314 uses a WY domain and a specialised C-terminal loop carrying a KVxF motif that interact with conserved surfaces on PP1c, known to be used by host regulatory proteins for guiding function. Through biophysical and in planta analyses, we demonstrate that Pi04314 WY or KVxF mutants lose their ability to bind PP1c. The loss of PP1c binding correlates with a reduced capacity to re-localize PP1c from the nucleolus and a decrease in lesion size in plant infection assays. This study provides insights into the manipulation of plant hosts by pathogens, revealing how effectors exploit key regulatory interfaces in host proteins to modify their function and facilitate disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wood constitutes the majority of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TDIF ligand-activated PXY receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-dependent PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In plants, a local infection can lead to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) through increased production of salicylic acid (SA). For 30 years, the identity of the mobile signal and its direct transduction mechanism for systemic SA synthesis in initiating SAR have been hotly debated. We found that, upon pathogen challenge, the cysteine residue of transcription factor CHE undergoes sulfenylation in systemic tissues, enhancing its binding to the promoter of SA-synthesis gene, ICS1, and increasing SA production. This occurs independently of previously reported pipecolic acid (Pip) signal. Instead, H2O2 produced by NADPH oxidase, RBOHD, is the mobile signal that sulfenylates CHE in a concentration-dependent manner. This modification serves as a molecular switch that activates CHE-mediated SA-increase and subsequent Pip-accumulation in systemic tissues to synergistically induce SAR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular condensates can form ribonucleoprotein assemblies with liquid or solid-like properties. These properties and the lack of a delineating membrane, make the compositional determination of condensates laborious. Here to investigate the composition of the condensates known as processing bodies (PBs) in the model plant Arabidopsis we set up a pipeline for proximity-biotinylation-dependent capture of RNA. Using in situ protein-protein interaction approaches, RNA detection, in silico analyses, genetics, and high-resolution imaging, we systematically study PBs composition and dynamics. RNA recruitment and turnover in PBs depend on binding proteins, mRNA methylation, and liquid-to-solid phase transitions of PBs. Network analyses showed that RNAs and the corresponding encoded proteins co-assemble in PBs, with the main function to keep RNAs of certain pathways translationally repressed. The actin polymerization cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex, by dissolving liquid-like PBs at membrane interfaces allows the re-entry of mRNAs in the translational machinery. This de-repression adjusts ethylene signaling affecting development and stress. Heat stress imparts dissolution of PBs as they solidify, explaining why immunity or development under these conditions malfunction. This study reveals a mechanism for translational reprogramming important for development and adaptation, driven by the material properties of a condensate and membrane interfaces.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Research Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN - a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recognition of microbial molecules triggers energy-intensive defence systems. Although successful defence should therefore depend on energy availability, whether and, if so, how cellular metabolic information is molecularly input into defence remains unclear. We show that sugar, especially glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), plays a key role in regulating the types and amplitudes of defence outputs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under sugar-sufficient conditions, protein and phosphorylation levels of calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5) are elevated by induced expression and G6P-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases, priming defence responses. Furthermore, recognition of bacterial flagellin activates sugar transporters, leading to increased cellular G6P, which elicits CPK5-independent signalling promoting synthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) involved in anti-bacterial defence. In contrast, while perception of fungal chitin does not promote sugar influx or SA accumulation, chitin-induced synthesis of the anti-fungal compound camalexin requires basal sugar influx activity. These results suggest that, by monitoring G6P levels, plants determine defence priming levels and execute appropriate outputs against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Together, our findings provide a comprehensive view of the roles of sugar in plant defence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides are important players in regulating cell expansion. In Arabidopsis, volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by the fungal phytopathogen Penicillium aurantiogriseum promote root hair (RH) proliferation and hyper-elongation through ethylene and enhanced photosynthesis signalling actions. A striking alteration in the proteome of fungal VC-treated roots involves up-regulation of RALF22. To test the possible involvement of RALF22 in the fungal VC-promoted RH changes, we characterized RH density and number responses to fungal VCs in ralf22 and fer-4 plants impaired in RALF22 and its receptor FERONIA, respectively. Unlike WT plants, ralf22 and fer-4 RHs responded weakly to fungal VCs, strongly indicating that the RALF22-FERONIA module is a key determinant of the RH response to fungal VCs. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms behind this response, we analysed the RALF22 transcript levels in roots of etr1-3 and eir1 ethylene signalling mutants and those of ethylene-responsive, RH-related RSL4, RHD2, PRX1 and PRX44 transcripts in ralf22 and fer-4 roots. Moreover, we characterized the RH and RALF22 transcript level responses to fungal VCs of the cfbp1 mutant defective in photosynthetic responsiveness to VCs. Unlike in WT roots, fungal VCs weakly enhanced RALF22 expression in etr1-3, eir1 and cfbp1 roots, and RSL4, RHD2, PRX1 and PRX44 expression in ralf22 and fer-4 roots. In addition, fungal VCs weakly promoted RH changes in cfbp1 roots. Collectively, our findings showed that the ethylene and enhanced photosynthesis signalling-mediated RH response to fungal VCs involves RALF22-FERONIA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cereal grains are an important food and feed. To provide comprehensive spatiotemporal information about biological processes in developing seeds of cultivated barley, we performed a transcriptomic study of the embryo, endosperm, and seed maternal tissues collected from 4 to 32 days after pollination. Weighted gene co-expression network and motif enrichment analyses pointed out specific groups of genes and transcription factors with possible impacts on regulating barley seed tissue development. We defined a set of tissue-specific marker genes and families of transcription factors for functional studies of the pathways controlling barley grain development. Assessment of selected groups of chromatin regulators revealed that epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and likely to play a major role during barley endosperm development. Repressive modification H3K27me3 is globally reduced in endosperm tissues and at specific developmental and storage compound genes. Altogether, this atlas uncovers the complexity of the developmental regulation of gene expression in barley grains.

TeaserSpatiotemporal profiling of developing barley seeds revealed loss of H3K27me3 and changes in gene expression in endosperm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acclimation is a multigenic trait by which plants adjust photosynthesis and metabolism to cope with a changing environment. Here, natural variation of photosynthetic and metabolic acclimation was analyzed in response to low and elevated temperature. For this, 18 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, originating from Africa and Europe, were grown at 22{degrees}C before being exposed to 4{degrees}C and 34{degrees}C for cold and heat acclimation, respectively. Amounts of carbohydrates were quantified together with their subcellular distribution across plastids, cytosol and vacuole. Linear electron transport rates (ETRs) were determined together with maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) for all growth conditions and under temperature fluctuation. Under elevated temperature, residuals of ETR under increasing photosynthetic photon flux densities were found to significantly correlate with the longitudinal gradient of the geographic origin of accessions indicating a naturally occurring east-west gradient of photosynthetic acclimation capacities. Further, in heat acclimated plants, vacuolar fructose amount was found to positively correlate with longitude while plastidial and cytosolic amounts were found to be negatively correlated. Plastidial sucrose concentrations were found to positively correlate with maximal ETRs under fluctuating temperature indicating a stabilizing role within the chloroplast. In summary, our findings revealed specific subcellular carbohydrate distributions which contribute differentially to photosynthetic efficiencies of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions across a longitudinal gradient. This sheds light on the relevance of subcellular metabolic regulation for photosynthetic performance in a fluctuating environment and supports the physiological interpretation of naturally occurring genetic variation of temperature tolerance and acclimation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When using chemical probes and inhibitors for cell biological studies, the uniform and rapid access of the chemical to the sample is key for the accuracy of the analysis. Until now, however, this could only be accomplished by using expensive equipment and labor-intensive and often lengthy procedures. Here, we introduce MiCHy, a micro-chambered hydroponics system, as an accessible and versatile method for chemical treatments and demonstrate its use for imaging roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, the major model system for plant cell biological research. Using lipid biosensors in combination with established chemicals, such as the phosphoinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitor phenylarsine oxide and the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor U73122, we demonstrate the suitability of MiCHy for studying the relationship between growth and lipid dynamics in root hairs. We further reveal novel effects of U73122 on the plasma membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 3 (PIP5K3), which is the first evidence demonstrating a role for U73122 besides its role as a PI-PLC inhibitor in plants.</p>
