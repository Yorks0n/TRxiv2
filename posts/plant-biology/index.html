A.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548689\nMeiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis, while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males. Using single molecule and single-pollen genome sequencing, we describe Teosinte Pollen Drive, an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), that depends on RNA interference (RNAi). 22nt small RNAs from a non-coding RNA hairpin in mexicana depend on Dicer-Like 2 (Dcl2) and target Teosinte Drive Responder 1 (Tdr1), which encodes a lipase required for pollen viability. Dcl2, Tdr1, and the hairpin are in tight pseudolinkage on chromosome 5, but only when transmitted through the male. Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas, and a tightly linked inversion in mexicana spans a major domestication sweep in modern maize. A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals correlated patterns of admixture among unlinked genes required for RNAi on at least 3 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids. Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication and evolution, and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of \"self\" small RNAs in the germlines of plants and animals.\nBasal expression of immune receptor genes requires low levels of the phytohormone salicylic acid\nAuthors: van Butselaar, T.; Silva, S.; Lapin, D.; Banales, I.; Tonn, S.; van Schie, C.; Van den Ackerveken, G.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548351\nThe hormone salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant immunity by activating responses that arrest pathogen ingress. Since SA accumulation also penalizes growth, the question remains why healthy plants synthesize this hormone. By overexpressing SA-inactivating hydroxylases in Arabidopsis thaliana, we reveal that basal SA levels in unchallenged plants are needed for expression of selected immune receptor and signaling genes, thereby enabling early pathogen detection and activation of immunity.\nRoot barrier surveillance mechanisms convey soil nitrogen status to shoots\nAuthors: Shen, D.; Wippel, K.; Remmel, S.; Zhang, P.; Kuertoes, N.; Neumann, U.; Kopriva, S.; Andersen, T. G.\nScore: 43.4, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.19.537470\nIn roots, formation of the Casparian strip in the endodermal cell walls provides a mechanism for selective uptake of nutrients and water. Establishment of this filter is under spatial surveillance by a receptor-ligand mechanism termed the Schengen pathway. This system provides a mechanism to initiate downstream signaling responses in case of dysfunctional barrier establishment. Due to this interconnected nature, the endogenous physiological role of this survaillance mechanism remain difficult to untangle from the direct barrier function. This is in particularly evident in complex growth setups where multiple inputs are integrated into general whole plant responses. In this work, we address this by rewiring the genetic network that underlies root barrier formation. We create plants with enhanced, Schengen-independent Casparian strip formation that are not only suitable to probe the role of stronger barrier establishment, but also to evaluate the associated signaling output independently. With focus on the latter, we subjected the rewired plants, as well as a number of established barrier mutants, to multifaceted growth conditions including nitrogen fertilized agricultural soil conditions. By profiling their above- and belowground (a)biotic responses our work reveals that, while increased Casparian strip formation mainly provides the plant with an improved stress resistance, the Schengen pathway is necessary for establishment of a growth-promoting root microbiome and serves to convey information of soil nitrogen status to the shoot. This identifies the Schengen pathway as an essential receptor-based signaling hub for adaptive integration of barrier status, nutritional responses and (a)biotic signaling between above- and belowground tissues.\nDetection and editing of the updated plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteomes for Arabidopsis with PeptideAtlas\nAuthors: van Wijk, K. J.; Bentolila, S.; Leppert, T.; Sun, Q.; Sun, Z.; Mendoza, L.; Li, M.; Deutsch, E. W.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548362\nArabidopsis thaliana Col-0 has plastid and mitochondrial genomes encoding for over one hundred proteins and several ORFs. Public databases (e.g. Araport11) have redundancy and discrepancies in gene identifiers for these organelle-encoded proteins. RNA editing results in changes to specific amino acid residues or creation of start and stop codons for many of these proteins, but the impact of such RNA editing at the protein level is largely unexplored due to the complexities of detection. This study first assembled the non-redundant set of identifiers, their correct protein sequences, and 452 predicted non-synonymous editing sites of which 56 are edited at lower frequency. Accumulation of edited and/or unedited proteoforms was then determined by searching [~]259 million raw MSMS spectra from ProteomeXchange as part of Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/). All mitochondrial proteins and all except three plastid-encoded proteins (NDHG/NDH6, PSBM, RPS16), but none of the ORFs, were identified; we suggest that all ORFs and RPS16 are pseudogenes. Detection frequencies for each edit site and type of edit (e.g. S to L/F) were determined at the protein level, cross-referenced against the metadata (e.g. tissue), and evaluated for technical challenges of detection.167 predicted edit sites were detected at the proteome level. Minor frequency sites were indeed also edited at low frequency at the protein level. However, except for sites RPL5-22 and CCB382-124, proteins only accumulate in edited form (\u003e98 -100% edited) even if RNA editing levels are well below 100%. This study establishes that RNA editing for major editing sites is required for stable protein accumulation.\nStand age diversity weakens forests sensitivity to climate change\nAuthors: Vangi, E.; Cioccolo, E.; Marano, G.; Dalmonech, D.; Bianchini, L.; Puchi, P.; Grieco, E.; Colantoni, A.; Chirici, G.; Collalti, A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548709\nForest age is the result of population dynamics, disturbance regimes, silviculture and plays an important role in the global Carbon (C) cycle. To examine the shaping effects of forest age on Carbon budget under current and future climate conditions, we used a biogeochemical-based model in three managed forest stands and then modeled their development as undisturbed systems. The model was forced with climate outputs under four representative climate scenarios over a matrix of 11 age classes for each stand. We find that the Net Primary Production (NPP) peak was reached in the middle-aged class (42- to-70-year-old) regardless of the climate scenario, while total C-woody stocks (tCWS) increased with age with different trajectories in the three sites, but not linearly as expected. Under climate change scenarios, the beech forest shows as expected increasing NPP with increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature as much for younger age classes as for older ones. Conversely, in the spruce and Scots pine dominated sites NPP and tCWS decrease under climate change scenarios. ANOVA analysis applied as factorial analysis to model outputs shows that age and climate scenarios have all effects on forest carbon budget only if taken singularly while their combination reduce if not totally weaken any effect.\nRepeated evolution of herbicide resistance in Lolium multiflorum revealed by haplotype-resolved analysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase\nAuthors: Brunharo, C.; Tranel, P.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548383\nHerbicide resistance in weeds is one of the greatest challenges in modern food production. The grass species Lolium multiflorum is an excellent model species to investigate convergent evolution under similar selection pressure because populations have repeatedly evolved resistance to many herbicides, utilizing a multitude of mechanisms to neutralize herbicide damage. In this work, we investigated the gene that encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), the target-site of the most successful herbicide group available for grass weed control. We sampled L. multiflorum populations from agricultural fields with history of intense herbicide use, and studied their response to three ACCase-inhibiting herbicides under controlled conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms of herbicide resistance and the genetic relationship among sampled populations, we resolved the haplotypes of 97 resistant and susceptible individuals by performing an amplicon-seq analysis using long-read DNA sequencing technologies, focusing on the DNA sequence encoding the carboxyl-transferase domain of ACCase. Our dose-response data indicated the existence of many, often unpredictable, resistance patterns to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, where populations exhibited as much as 37-fold reduction in herbicide response. The majority of the populations exhibited resistance to all three herbicides studied. Phylogenetic and molecular genetic analyses revealed multiple evolutionary origins of resistance-endowing ACCase haplotypes, as well as widespread admixture in the region regardless of cropping system. The amplicons generated were very diverse, with haplotypes exhibiting 26 to 110 polymorphisms. Polymorphisms included insertions and deletions 1-31 bp in length, none of which were associated with the resistance phenotype. We also found evidence that some populations have multiple mechanisms of resistance. Our results highlight the astounding genetic diversity in L. multiflorum populations, and the potential for convergent evolution of herbicide resistance across the landscape that challenges weed management and jeopardizes sustainable weed control practices. We provide an in-depth discussion of the evolutionary and practical implications of our results.\nDataPLAN: a web-based data management plan generator for the plant sciences\nAuthors: Zhou, X.-R.; Beier, S.; Brilhaus, D.; Rodrigues, C. M.; Mühlhaus, T.; von Suchodoletz, D.; Twyman, R. M.; Usadel, B.; Kranz, A.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548147\nResearch Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN - a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.\nFrom Asymptomatic to Symptomatic: Multiomics profiling of the temporal response of grapevine viral-mixed infection\nAuthors: Lamine Fall, M.; Poursalavati, A.; Sidibe, A.; Xu, D.; Lemoyne, P.; Silva Martins, G.; Jalali Javaran, V.; Moffett, P.; Odile, C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549167\nMixed viral infections are common in grapevines. However, our understanding of the factors and signaling pathways that influence the expression of viral symptoms in mixed infections is still incomplete. In a previous study, we revealed that the presence of grapevine leafroll-associated virus species in mixed infections was randomly associated with the development of virus-like symptoms. To understand what drives the timing of these virus-like symptoms in mixed infections, we used dsRNA and total RNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis to profile the viromes, metabolites, and transcripts of grapevine leaves collected at two different times of the year (summer and autumn). We demonstrated that neither viral titre nor virome composition changes were associated with symptom expression in autumn. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased in most plants except for those with early onset symptoms. According to the results of differential gene expression analysis, cell wall biosynthesis pathways were significantly downregulated in all grapevine plants infected with grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3, grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus, and grapevine Pinot gris virus. In addition, polyketide pathways were significantly upregulated in all cultivars, while flavonoid precursor (e.g. abscisic acid) production was significantly reduced in plants that expressed strong virus-like symptoms. In the 'Vidal' cultivar, an uncharacterized double-stranded RNA-binding protein (DRB) appears to play a critical role in the plant's antiviral defences, supporting the recent hypothesis that DRBs make an important contribution to dominant antiviral responses in plants. The seasonality of the expression virus-like symptoms appears to be a consequence of the dynamic interactions between antiviral factors and viral counter-defences that occur at different developmental stages of grapevine.\nSpatiotemporal distribution of ROS production, delivery and utilization in Arabidopsis root hairs\nAuthors: Kubenova, L.; Haberland, J.; Dvorak, P.; Samaj, J.; Ovecka, M.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.05.522872\nFluorescent selective probes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in living cells are versatile tools for the documentation of ROS production in plant developmental or stress reactions. We employed high-resolution live-cell imaging and semi-quantitative analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana stained with CM-H2DCFDA, CellROXTM Deep Red and AmplexTM Red for functional characterization of spatiotemporal mode of ROS production, delivery and utilization during root hair formation. Cell viability marker fluorescein diacetate served as a positive control for dye-loading and undisturbed tip growth after staining. Colocalization analysis with subcellular molecular markers and utilization of two root hair mutants with similar phenotype of non-elongating root hairs, but with contrast reasons for this impairment, we found that: i) CM-H2DCFDA is a sensitive probe for ROS generation in cytoplasm, ii) CellROXTM Deep Red labels ROS in mitochondria, iii) AmplexTM Red labels apoplastic ROS and mitochondria, and shows high selectivity to root hairs, iv) rhd2-1 mutant with nonfunctional AtRBOHC/RHD2 has a low level of CM-H2DCFDA-reactive ROS in cytoplasm and lacks AmplexTM Red-reactive ROS in apoplast, v) ACTIN2-deficient der1-3 mutant is not altered in these aspects. The sensitivity of CellROXTM Deep Red was documented by discrimination between larger ROS-containing mitochondria and small, yet ROS-free pre-mature mitochondria in the growing tip of root hairs. We characterized spatial changes in ROS production and compartmentalization induced by external ROS modulators, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and ionophore valinomycin. This dynamic and high-resolution study of ROS production and utilization opens new opportunities for precise speciation of particular ROS involved in the root hair formation. One sentence summary: High-resolution live-cell imaging of ROS production and subcellular localization in bulges and growing root hairs of Arabidopsis using CM-H2DCFDA, CellROXTM Deep Red and AmplexTM Red selective probes.\nMultiplexed effector screening for recognition by endogenous resistance genes using positive defense reporters in wheat protoplasts\nAuthors: Wilson, S.; Dagvadorj, B.; Tam, R.; Murphy, L.; Heng, N.; Crean, E.; Greenwood, J.; Rathjen, J.; Schwessinger, B.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.30.538885\nA key goal in agriculture is to create pathogen-resistant crop species via breeding or biotechnological approaches. Plant resistance (R) and pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene interactions play a vital role in pathogen resistance. Efficient molecular screening tools for crops lack far behind their model organism counterparts, yet they are essential to rapidly identify agriculturally important molecular interactions that trigger host resistance. To fill this important gap, we have developed a novel wheat protoplast assay that enables efficient screening of Avr/R interactions at scale. Our assay allows access to the extensive gene pool of phenotypically described R genes because it does not require the overexpression of cloned R genes. It is suitable for multiplexed Avr screening, with interactions tested in pools of up to fifty Avr candidates. Our assay is based on newly identified Avr/R-induced defense genes which we used to create promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. We combined these reporter constructs with a synthetic biology based dual-color ratiometric reporter system that normalizes read-outs accounting for experimental variability and Avr/R-induced cell-death. In addition, we introduced a replicon-based plasmid derived from the wheat dwarf virus, which self-replicates in wheat reducing the amount of plasmid used in the assay. Our new assay increases the throughput of Avr candidate screening, accelerating the study of cellular defense signaling and resistance gene identification in wheat. We anticipate that the uptake of our assay by the community will significantly accelerate Avr identification for many wheat pathogens, leading to improved genome-guided pathogen surveillance and breeding of disease-resistant crops.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Meiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis, while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males. Using single molecule and single-pollen genome sequencing, we describe Teosinte Pollen Drive, an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), that depends on RNA interference (RNAi). 22nt small RNAs from a non-coding RNA hairpin in mexicana depend on Dicer-Like 2 (Dcl2) and target Teosinte Drive Responder 1 (Tdr1), which encodes a lipase required for pollen viability. Dcl2, Tdr1, and the hairpin are in tight pseudolinkage on chromosome 5, but only when transmitted through the male. Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas, and a tightly linked inversion in mexicana spans a major domestication sweep in modern maize. A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals correlated patterns of admixture among unlinked genes required for RNAi on at least 3 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids. Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication and evolution, and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of &#34;self&#34; small RNAs in the germlines of plants and animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The hormone salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant immunity by activating responses that arrest pathogen ingress. Since SA accumulation also penalizes growth, the question remains why healthy plants synthesize this hormone. By overexpressing SA-inactivating hydroxylases in Arabidopsis thaliana, we reveal that basal SA levels in unchallenged plants are needed for expression of selected immune receptor and signaling genes, thereby enabling early pathogen detection and activation of immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In roots, formation of the Casparian strip in the endodermal cell walls provides a mechanism for selective uptake of nutrients and water. Establishment of this filter is under spatial surveillance by a receptor-ligand mechanism termed the Schengen pathway. This system provides a mechanism to initiate downstream signaling responses in case of dysfunctional barrier establishment. Due to this interconnected nature, the endogenous physiological role of this survaillance mechanism remain difficult to untangle from the direct barrier function. This is in particularly evident in complex growth setups where multiple inputs are integrated into general whole plant responses. In this work, we address this by rewiring the genetic network that underlies root barrier formation. We create plants with enhanced, Schengen-independent Casparian strip formation that are not only suitable to probe the role of stronger barrier establishment, but also to evaluate the associated signaling output independently. With focus on the latter, we subjected the rewired plants, as well as a number of established barrier mutants, to multifaceted growth conditions including nitrogen fertilized agricultural soil conditions. By profiling their above- and belowground (a)biotic responses our work reveals that, while increased Casparian strip formation mainly provides the plant with an improved stress resistance, the Schengen pathway is necessary for establishment of a growth-promoting root microbiome and serves to convey information of soil nitrogen status to the shoot. This identifies the Schengen pathway as an essential receptor-based signaling hub for adaptive integration of barrier status, nutritional responses and (a)biotic signaling between above- and belowground tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 has plastid and mitochondrial genomes encoding for over one hundred proteins and several ORFs. Public databases (e.g. Araport11) have redundancy and discrepancies in gene identifiers for these organelle-encoded proteins. RNA editing results in changes to specific amino acid residues or creation of start and stop codons for many of these proteins, but the impact of such RNA editing at the protein level is largely unexplored due to the complexities of detection. This study first assembled the non-redundant set of identifiers, their correct protein sequences, and 452 predicted non-synonymous editing sites of which 56 are edited at lower frequency. Accumulation of edited and/or unedited proteoforms was then determined by searching [~]259 million raw MSMS spectra from ProteomeXchange as part of Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/). All mitochondrial proteins and all except three plastid-encoded proteins (NDHG/NDH6, PSBM, RPS16), but none of the ORFs, were identified; we suggest that all ORFs and RPS16 are pseudogenes. Detection frequencies for each edit site and type of edit (e.g. S to L/F) were determined at the protein level, cross-referenced against the metadata (e.g. tissue), and evaluated for technical challenges of detection.167 predicted edit sites were detected at the proteome level. Minor frequency sites were indeed also edited at low frequency at the protein level. However, except for sites RPL5-22 and CCB382-124, proteins only accumulate in edited form (&gt;98 -100% edited) even if RNA editing levels are well below 100%. This study establishes that RNA editing for major editing sites is required for stable protein accumulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Forest age is the result of population dynamics, disturbance regimes, silviculture and plays an important role in the global Carbon (C) cycle. To examine the shaping effects of forest age on Carbon budget under current and future climate conditions, we used a biogeochemical-based model in three managed forest stands and then modeled their development as undisturbed systems. The model was forced with climate outputs under four representative climate scenarios over a matrix of 11 age classes for each stand. We find that the Net Primary Production (NPP) peak was reached in the middle-aged class (42- to-70-year-old) regardless of the climate scenario, while total C-woody stocks (tCWS) increased with age with different trajectories in the three sites, but not linearly as expected. Under climate change scenarios, the beech forest shows as expected increasing NPP with increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature as much for younger age classes as for older ones. Conversely, in the spruce and Scots pine dominated sites NPP and tCWS decrease under climate change scenarios. ANOVA analysis applied as factorial analysis to model outputs shows that age and climate scenarios have all effects on forest carbon budget only if taken singularly while their combination reduce if not totally weaken any effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Herbicide resistance in weeds is one of the greatest challenges in modern food production. The grass species Lolium multiflorum is an excellent model species to investigate convergent evolution under similar selection pressure because populations have repeatedly evolved resistance to many herbicides, utilizing a multitude of mechanisms to neutralize herbicide damage. In this work, we investigated the gene that encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), the target-site of the most successful herbicide group available for grass weed control. We sampled L. multiflorum populations from agricultural fields with history of intense herbicide use, and studied their response to three ACCase-inhibiting herbicides under controlled conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms of herbicide resistance and the genetic relationship among sampled populations, we resolved the haplotypes of 97 resistant and susceptible individuals by performing an amplicon-seq analysis using long-read DNA sequencing technologies, focusing on the DNA sequence encoding the carboxyl-transferase domain of ACCase. Our dose-response data indicated the existence of many, often unpredictable, resistance patterns to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, where populations exhibited as much as 37-fold reduction in herbicide response. The majority of the populations exhibited resistance to all three herbicides studied. Phylogenetic and molecular genetic analyses revealed multiple evolutionary origins of resistance-endowing ACCase haplotypes, as well as widespread admixture in the region regardless of cropping system. The amplicons generated were very diverse, with haplotypes exhibiting 26 to 110 polymorphisms. Polymorphisms included insertions and deletions 1-31 bp in length, none of which were associated with the resistance phenotype. We also found evidence that some populations have multiple mechanisms of resistance. Our results highlight the astounding genetic diversity in L. multiflorum populations, and the potential for convergent evolution of herbicide resistance across the landscape that challenges weed management and jeopardizes sustainable weed control practices. We provide an in-depth discussion of the evolutionary and practical implications of our results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Research Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN - a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mixed viral infections are common in grapevines. However, our understanding of the factors and signaling pathways that influence the expression of viral symptoms in mixed infections is still incomplete. In a previous study, we revealed that the presence of grapevine leafroll-associated virus species in mixed infections was randomly associated with the development of virus-like symptoms. To understand what drives the timing of these virus-like symptoms in mixed infections, we used dsRNA and total RNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis to profile the viromes, metabolites, and transcripts of grapevine leaves collected at two different times of the year (summer and autumn). We demonstrated that neither viral titre nor virome composition changes were associated with symptom expression in autumn. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity increased in most plants except for those with early onset symptoms. According to the results of differential gene expression analysis, cell wall biosynthesis pathways were significantly downregulated in all grapevine plants infected with grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3, grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus, and grapevine Pinot gris virus. In addition, polyketide pathways were significantly upregulated in all cultivars, while flavonoid precursor (e.g. abscisic acid) production was significantly reduced in plants that expressed strong virus-like symptoms. In the &#39;Vidal&#39; cultivar, an uncharacterized double-stranded RNA-binding protein (DRB) appears to play a critical role in the plant&#39;s antiviral defences, supporting the recent hypothesis that DRBs make an important contribution to dominant antiviral responses in plants. The seasonality of the expression virus-like symptoms appears to be a consequence of the dynamic interactions between antiviral factors and viral counter-defences that occur at different developmental stages of grapevine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fluorescent selective probes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in living cells are versatile tools for the documentation of ROS production in plant developmental or stress reactions. We employed high-resolution live-cell imaging and semi-quantitative analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana stained with CM-H2DCFDA, CellROXTM Deep Red and AmplexTM Red for functional characterization of spatiotemporal mode of ROS production, delivery and utilization during root hair formation. Cell viability marker fluorescein diacetate served as a positive control for dye-loading and undisturbed tip growth after staining. Colocalization analysis with subcellular molecular markers and utilization of two root hair mutants with similar phenotype of non-elongating root hairs, but with contrast reasons for this impairment, we found that: i) CM-H2DCFDA is a sensitive probe for ROS generation in cytoplasm, ii) CellROXTM Deep Red labels ROS in mitochondria, iii) AmplexTM Red labels apoplastic ROS and mitochondria, and shows high selectivity to root hairs, iv) rhd2-1 mutant with nonfunctional AtRBOHC/RHD2 has a low level of CM-H2DCFDA-reactive ROS in cytoplasm and lacks AmplexTM Red-reactive ROS in apoplast, v) ACTIN2-deficient der1-3 mutant is not altered in these aspects. The sensitivity of CellROXTM Deep Red was documented by discrimination between larger ROS-containing mitochondria and small, yet ROS-free pre-mature mitochondria in the growing tip of root hairs. We characterized spatial changes in ROS production and compartmentalization induced by external ROS modulators, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and ionophore valinomycin. This dynamic and high-resolution study of ROS production and utilization opens new opportunities for precise speciation of particular ROS involved in the root hair formation.

        <p class="abstract">A key goal in agriculture is to create pathogen-resistant crop species via breeding or biotechnological approaches. Plant resistance (R) and pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene interactions play a vital role in pathogen resistance. Efficient molecular screening tools for crops lack far behind their model organism counterparts, yet they are essential to rapidly identify agriculturally important molecular interactions that trigger host resistance. To fill this important gap, we have developed a novel wheat protoplast assay that enables efficient screening of Avr/R interactions at scale. Our assay allows access to the extensive gene pool of phenotypically described R genes because it does not require the overexpression of cloned R genes. It is suitable for multiplexed Avr screening, with interactions tested in pools of up to fifty Avr candidates. Our assay is based on newly identified Avr/R-induced defense genes which we used to create promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. We combined these reporter constructs with a synthetic biology based dual-color ratiometric reporter system that normalizes read-outs accounting for experimental variability and Avr/R-induced cell-death. In addition, we introduced a replicon-based plasmid derived from the wheat dwarf virus, which self-replicates in wheat reducing the amount of plasmid used in the assay. Our new assay increases the throughput of Avr candidate screening, accelerating the study of cellular defense signaling and resistance gene identification in wheat. We anticipate that the uptake of our assay by the community will significantly accelerate Avr identification for many wheat pathogens, leading to improved genome-guided pathogen surveillance and breeding of disease-resistant crops.</p>
