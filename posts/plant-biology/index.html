D.\nScore: 76.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560457\nScientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields. Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.\nTransposon-triggered epigenetic chromatin dynamics modulate EFR-related pathogen response\nAuthors: Mencia, R.; Arce, A. L.; Houriet, C.; Xian, W.; Contreras, A.; Shirsekar, G.; Weigel, D.; Manavella, P. A.\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561201\nInfectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive \"EFR-open\" chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.\nA conserved ESCRT-II-like protein participates in the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes\nAuthors: Yilmazer, I.; Vetrano, P.; Eicke, S.; Abt, M. R.; Traverso, E.; Morosinotto, T.; Zeeman, S. C.; Ramundo, S.; Sharma, M.\nScore: 28.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561251\nThylakoids are membrane-bound compartments located in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae. They play an indispensable role in the light-driven reactions that enable photosynthetic organisms to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugars. The biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes is a critical yet underappreciated area of research. One of the few known critical regulators of this process, VIPP1 (Vesicle-Inducing Protein in Plastids 1), was recently shown to be structurally similar to ESCRT-III proteins-the first evidence for ESCRT-like (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) machinery in chloroplasts. Here, we used an affinity purification approach in two distantly related photosynthetic eukaryotes, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover proteins that interact with VIPP1. Among several newly identified proteins, we focused on a highly conserved but uncharacterized protein (VIPP1-Associated protein 1, VIA1) that robustly interacts with VIPP1 in both systems. VIA1 is predicted to contain a winged-helix domain, a characteristic feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins. The absence of VIA1 causes thylakoid swelling upon exposure to high light in Chlamydomonas and defective thylakoid biogenesis in the newly emerging leaf tissue in Arabidopsis, thereby delaying chloroplast development in this tissue. We propose that VIA1 is part of a previously unrecognized chloroplast ESCRT-like system that plays a critical role in forming, remodeling, and repairing photosynthetic membranes.\nThe benzoxazinoid breakdown product 5-Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol has a dual function in maize defense against herbivory\nAuthors: Schimmel, B. C. J.; Escobar-Bravo, R.; Mateo, P.; Chen, C.; Glauser, G.; Ogi, V.; Wang, L.; Verdecia-Mogena, A.; Robert, C. A. M.; Erb, M.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561717\nCatabolism of plant secondary metabolites can yield bioactive breakdown products. However, these compounds often remain poorly characterized. Here, we report on the discovery, biosynthesis, and biological relevance of 5 Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol (5M2NP), a secondary metabolite breakdown product which accumulates in damaged maize tissues. We used mutant plants, biochemical complementation, and metabolomic analyses to determine the biosynthetic origin of 5M2NP. Additionally, we assessed 5M2NP's role in plant defense against herbivores. For this, we surveyed defense-associated responses (gene expression, phytohormones, volatile organic compounds) in wounded, 5M2NP-supplemented maize leaves, and performed bioassays with herbivorous insects. We found that 5M2NP accumulation upon tissue disruption is contingent upon a functional benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway. Labeling experiments demonstrated that 5M2NP is derived from DIMBOA. Physiological doses of exogenous 5M2NP increased the wound-induced expression of defense genes and emission of terpenoids. Additionally, 5M2NP exhibited antibiotic and antixenotic activities towards both generalist and specialist herbivores in nano- to micromolar quantities. We conclude that 5M2NP, which represents a novel class of plant-derived compounds, can act as a direct defense and a defense modulator. 5M2NP thus expands the functional repertoire of benzoxazinoids and likely contributes to their protective function against insect herbivores. The discovery of 5M2NP highlights the multifunctionality of plant secondary metabolites and their breakdown products.\nDevelopmentally regulated generation of a systemic signal for long-lasting defence priming in tomato\nAuthors: Stevens, K.; Roberts, M. R.; Jeynes-Cupper, K.; Catoni, M.; Luna, E.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561512\nTomato plants can be chemically primed to express long-lasting induced resistance (IR) for the protection of fruit against pathogen infection. Here, we determined that priming results in maintenance of IR in fruit and progeny of tomato plants only when initiated at an early developmental stage. Global DNA methylation analysis revealed seedling-specific changes, which occurred in the context of lower basal methylation, suggesting a greater epigenetic imprinting capacity of young plants. Remarkably, IR was found to be transmissible from primed rootstock to grafted unprimed scions. In these scions, we identified a subset of mobile 24 nt small RNAs associated with genes with enhanced expression in response to Botrytis cinerea infection in fruit, suggesting the functional association of a systemic signal with long-lasting IR and priming. Through integrated omics approaches we have identified markers of long-lasting priming in tomato fruit which could also serve as targets for durable resistance in other crops.\nNitric Oxide controls shoot meristem activity via regulation of DNA methylation\nAuthors: Zeng, J.; Zhao, X.; Liang, Z.; Hidalgo, I.; Gebert, M.; Fan, P.; Wenzl, C.; Gornik, S. G.; Lohmann, J. U.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561157\nDespite the importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) as signaling molecule in both plant and animal development1-7, the regulatory mechanisms downstream of NO remain largely unclear. Here, we show that NO is involved in Arabidopsis shoot stem cell control via modifying expression and activity of ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a core component of the RNA directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway. Mutations in components of the RdDM pathway cause meristematic defects, and reduce responses of the stem cell system to NO signaling. Importantly, we found that the stem cell inducing WUSCHEL transcription factor directly interacts with AGO4 in an NO dependent manner, explaining how these two signaling systems may converge to modify DNA methylation patterns. Taken together, our results reveal that NO signaling plays an important role in controlling plant stem cell homeostasis via the regulation of de novo DNA methylation.\nCompensation of compromised PRC2 regulation by a miRNA ensures robustness of Arabidopsis leaf development\nAuthors: Maugarny, A.; Vialette, A.; Adroher, B.; Mathy-Franchet, N.; Roudier, F.; Laufs, P.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561475\nRobustness is pervasive throughout biological systems, enabling them to maintain persistent outputs despite perturbations in their components. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism contributing to leaf morphology robustness in the face of genetic perturbations. In Arabidopsis, leaf shape is established during early development through the quantitative action of the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) gene that is negatively regulated by the co-expressed MICRORNA164A (MIR164A) gene. Compromised epigenetic regulation due to defective Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function results in the transcriptional derepression of CUC2 but has no impact on CUC2 protein dynamics or early morphogenesis. We solve this apparent paradox by showing that compromised PRC2 function simultaneously activates a compensatory mechanism involving another member of the MIR164 gene family, the MIR164B gene. This mechanism dampens CUC2 protein levels, thereby compensating for compromised PRC2 function and canalizing early leaf morphogenesis. Furthermore, we show that this compensation mechanism is active under different environmental conditions. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between different types of transcriptional regulation can contribute to developmental robustness.\nRole of Dynamin-Related Proteins 2 and SH3P2 in Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in Plants\nAuthors: Gnyliukh, N.; Johnson, A.; Nagel, M.-K.; Monzer, A.; Hlavata, A.; Isono, E.; Loose, M.; Friml, J.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561523\nClathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is vital for the regulation of plant growth and development by controlling plasma membrane protein composition and cargo uptake. CME relies on the precise recruitment of regulators for vesicle maturation and release. Homologues of components of mammalian vesicle scission are strong candidates to be part of the scissin machinery in plants, but the precise roles of these proteins in this process is not fully understood. Here, we characterised the roles of Plant Dynamin-Related Proteins 2 (DRP2s) and SH3-domain containing protein 2 (SH3P2), the plant homologue to Dynamin recruiters, like Endophilin and Amphiphysin, in the CME by combining high-resolution imaging of endocytic events in vivo and characterisation of the purified proteins in vitro. Although DRP2s and SH3P2 arrive similarly late during CME and physically interact, genetic analysis of the {Delta}sh3p1,2,3 triple-mutant and complementation assays with non-SH3P2-interacting DRP2 variants suggests that SH3P2 does not directly recruit DRP2s to the site of endocytosis. These observations imply that despite the presence of many well-conserved endocytic components, plants have acquired a distinct mechanism for CME.\nArabidopsis AGO1 N-terminal Poly-Q domain promotes phase separation and association with stress granules during heat stress\nAuthors: Blagojevic, A.; Baldrich, P.; Schiaffini, M.; Lechner, E.; Baumberger, N.; Hammann, P.; Elmayan, T.; Garcia, D.; Vaucheret, H.; Meyers, B.; Genschik, P.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562039\nIn Arabidopsis thaliana, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) plays a central role in microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Nuclear AGO1 is loaded with miRNAs and exported to the cytosol where it associates to the rough ER to conduct miRNA-mediated translational repression, mRNA cleavage and biogenesis of phased siRNAs. These latter, as well as other cytosolic siRNAs, are loaded into cytosolic AGO1, but in which compartment this happens is not known. Moreover, the effect of stress on AGO1 localization is still unclear. Here, we show that a 37 degree Celsius heat stress (HS) promotes AGO1 protein accumulation in cytosolic condensates where it co-localizes with components of siRNA bodies and of stress granules (SGs). AGO1 contains a prion-like domain in its poorly characterized N-terminal Poly-Q domain, which, is sufficient to undergo phase separation, independent of the presence or absence of SGS3. HS only moderately affects the small RNA repertoire, the loading of AGO1 by miRNAs and the signatures of target cleavage, suggesting that its localization in condensates protects AGO1 rather than promotes or impairs its activity in reprograming gene expressing during stress. Collectively, our work shed new light on the impact of high temperature on a main effector of RNA silencing in plants.\nPhotosynthesis is led by stomatal circadian rhythm and not by starch depletion after a long period of darkness\nAuthors: Dresch, C.; Vidal, V.; Suchail, S.; Sallanon, H.; Charles, F.; Truffault, V.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561115\nThe circadian rhythm is an endogenous rhythm, defined by repeated metabolic oscillations every 24 hours under constant parameters. In plants, the circadian rhythm regulates the growth through photosynthesis and the management of carbohydrates. In indoor farming, the photoperiod is independent from the sunlight and is of interest to increase energy savings. In this work, we studied the effects of modifications of photoperiods on indoor-grown lettuces (L. sativa), which were then not tuned with the circadian rhythm. The pattern of photoperiods applied was: 16/12-16/8-16/8. A mutant-free study was carried out to avoid genes shutdown unintended side effects and to evaluate the impact of the circadian rhythm under marketable production conditions. We observed that the circadian regulation of the stomatal conductance was the main limiting factor of net photosynthesis when the photoperiod is exceptionally not tuned with the circadian rhythm. In our experiment, the disruption of the circadian rhythm decreased the photosynthetic activity by 6.2% throughout the light period, with no alteration of the yield, morphology or light and water use efficiencies. Furthermore, starch depletion induced by the changes in the photoperiod could not explain variations of the net photosynthetic activity during the following light period. Interestingly, disrupting the circadian rhythm saved 5% of lighting time compared to the control, which can be converted into energy savings. Consequently, the circadian rhythm can be defined as a limiting factor for reducing energy consumption in indoor farming. Further characterization of the links between the photosynthesis-carbohydrates-growth continuum and the circadian rhythm is thus required.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive &#34;EFR-open&#34; chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thylakoids are membrane-bound compartments located in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae. They play an indispensable role in the light-driven reactions that enable photosynthetic organisms to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugars. The biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes is a critical yet underappreciated area of research. One of the few known critical regulators of this process, VIPP1 (Vesicle-Inducing Protein in Plastids 1), was recently shown to be structurally similar to ESCRT-III proteins-the first evidence for ESCRT-like (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) machinery in chloroplasts. Here, we used an affinity purification approach in two distantly related photosynthetic eukaryotes, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover proteins that interact with VIPP1. Among several newly identified proteins, we focused on a highly conserved but uncharacterized protein (VIPP1-Associated protein 1, VIA1) that robustly interacts with VIPP1 in both systems. VIA1 is predicted to contain a winged-helix domain, a characteristic feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins. The absence of VIA1 causes thylakoid swelling upon exposure to high light in Chlamydomonas and defective thylakoid biogenesis in the newly emerging leaf tissue in Arabidopsis, thereby delaying chloroplast development in this tissue. We propose that VIA1 is part of a previously unrecognized chloroplast ESCRT-like system that plays a critical role in forming, remodeling, and repairing photosynthetic membranes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Catabolism of plant secondary metabolites can yield bioactive breakdown products. However, these compounds often remain poorly characterized. Here, we report on the discovery, biosynthesis, and biological relevance of 5 Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol (5M2NP), a secondary metabolite breakdown product which accumulates in damaged maize tissues. We used mutant plants, biochemical complementation, and metabolomic analyses to determine the biosynthetic origin of 5M2NP. Additionally, we assessed 5M2NP&#39;s role in plant defense against herbivores. For this, we surveyed defense-associated responses (gene expression, phytohormones, volatile organic compounds) in wounded, 5M2NP-supplemented maize leaves, and performed bioassays with herbivorous insects. We found that 5M2NP accumulation upon tissue disruption is contingent upon a functional benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway. Labeling experiments demonstrated that 5M2NP is derived from DIMBOA. Physiological doses of exogenous 5M2NP increased the wound-induced expression of defense genes and emission of terpenoids. Additionally, 5M2NP exhibited antibiotic and antixenotic activities towards both generalist and specialist herbivores in nano- to micromolar quantities. We conclude that 5M2NP, which represents a novel class of plant-derived compounds, can act as a direct defense and a defense modulator. 5M2NP thus expands the functional repertoire of benzoxazinoids and likely contributes to their protective function against insect herbivores. The discovery of 5M2NP highlights the multifunctionality of plant secondary metabolites and their breakdown products.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tomato plants can be chemically primed to express long-lasting induced resistance (IR) for the protection of fruit against pathogen infection. Here, we determined that priming results in maintenance of IR in fruit and progeny of tomato plants only when initiated at an early developmental stage. Global DNA methylation analysis revealed seedling-specific changes, which occurred in the context of lower basal methylation, suggesting a greater epigenetic imprinting capacity of young plants. Remarkably, IR was found to be transmissible from primed rootstock to grafted unprimed scions. In these scions, we identified a subset of mobile 24 nt small RNAs associated with genes with enhanced expression in response to Botrytis cinerea infection in fruit, suggesting the functional association of a systemic signal with long-lasting IR and priming. Through integrated omics approaches we have identified markers of long-lasting priming in tomato fruit which could also serve as targets for durable resistance in other crops.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) as signaling molecule in both plant and animal development1-7, the regulatory mechanisms downstream of NO remain largely unclear. Here, we show that NO is involved in Arabidopsis shoot stem cell control via modifying expression and activity of ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a core component of the RNA directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway. Mutations in components of the RdDM pathway cause meristematic defects, and reduce responses of the stem cell system to NO signaling. Importantly, we found that the stem cell inducing WUSCHEL transcription factor directly interacts with AGO4 in an NO dependent manner, explaining how these two signaling systems may converge to modify DNA methylation patterns. Taken together, our results reveal that NO signaling plays an important role in controlling plant stem cell homeostasis via the regulation of de novo DNA methylation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Robustness is pervasive throughout biological systems, enabling them to maintain persistent outputs despite perturbations in their components. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism contributing to leaf morphology robustness in the face of genetic perturbations. In Arabidopsis, leaf shape is established during early development through the quantitative action of the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) gene that is negatively regulated by the co-expressed MICRORNA164A (MIR164A) gene. Compromised epigenetic regulation due to defective Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function results in the transcriptional derepression of CUC2 but has no impact on CUC2 protein dynamics or early morphogenesis. We solve this apparent paradox by showing that compromised PRC2 function simultaneously activates a compensatory mechanism involving another member of the MIR164 gene family, the MIR164B gene. This mechanism dampens CUC2 protein levels, thereby compensating for compromised PRC2 function and canalizing early leaf morphogenesis. Furthermore, we show that this compensation mechanism is active under different environmental conditions. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between different types of transcriptional regulation can contribute to developmental robustness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is vital for the regulation of plant growth and development by controlling plasma membrane protein composition and cargo uptake. CME relies on the precise recruitment of regulators for vesicle maturation and release. Homologues of components of mammalian vesicle scission are strong candidates to be part of the scissin machinery in plants, but the precise roles of these proteins in this process is not fully understood. Here, we characterised the roles of Plant Dynamin-Related Proteins 2 (DRP2s) and SH3-domain containing protein 2 (SH3P2), the plant homologue to Dynamin recruiters, like Endophilin and Amphiphysin, in the CME by combining high-resolution imaging of endocytic events in vivo and characterisation of the purified proteins in vitro. Although DRP2s and SH3P2 arrive similarly late during CME and physically interact, genetic analysis of the {Delta}sh3p1,2,3 triple-mutant and complementation assays with non-SH3P2-interacting DRP2 variants suggests that SH3P2 does not directly recruit DRP2s to the site of endocytosis. These observations imply that despite the presence of many well-conserved endocytic components, plants have acquired a distinct mechanism for CME.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) plays a central role in microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Nuclear AGO1 is loaded with miRNAs and exported to the cytosol where it associates to the rough ER to conduct miRNA-mediated translational repression, mRNA cleavage and biogenesis of phased siRNAs. These latter, as well as other cytosolic siRNAs, are loaded into cytosolic AGO1, but in which compartment this happens is not known. Moreover, the effect of stress on AGO1 localization is still unclear. Here, we show that a 37 degree Celsius heat stress (HS) promotes AGO1 protein accumulation in cytosolic condensates where it co-localizes with components of siRNA bodies and of stress granules (SGs). AGO1 contains a prion-like domain in its poorly characterized N-terminal Poly-Q domain, which, is sufficient to undergo phase separation, independent of the presence or absence of SGS3. HS only moderately affects the small RNA repertoire, the loading of AGO1 by miRNAs and the signatures of target cleavage, suggesting that its localization in condensates protects AGO1 rather than promotes or impairs its activity in reprograming gene expressing during stress. Collectively, our work shed new light on the impact of high temperature on a main effector of RNA silencing in plants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The circadian rhythm is an endogenous rhythm, defined by repeated metabolic oscillations every 24 hours under constant parameters. In plants, the circadian rhythm regulates the growth through photosynthesis and the management of carbohydrates. In indoor farming, the photoperiod is independent from the sunlight and is of interest to increase energy savings. In this work, we studied the effects of modifications of photoperiods on indoor-grown lettuces (L. sativa), which were then not tuned with the circadian rhythm. The pattern of photoperiods applied was: 16/12-16/8-16/8. A mutant-free study was carried out to avoid genes shutdown unintended side effects and to evaluate the impact of the circadian rhythm under marketable production conditions. We observed that the circadian regulation of the stomatal conductance was the main limiting factor of net photosynthesis when the photoperiod is exceptionally not tuned with the circadian rhythm. In our experiment, the disruption of the circadian rhythm decreased the photosynthetic activity by 6.2% throughout the light period, with no alteration of the yield, morphology or light and water use efficiencies. Furthermore, starch depletion induced by the changes in the photoperiod could not explain variations of the net photosynthetic activity during the following light period. Interestingly, disrupting the circadian rhythm saved 5% of lighting time compared to the control, which can be converted into energy savings. Consequently, the circadian rhythm can be defined as a limiting factor for reducing energy consumption in indoor farming. Further characterization of the links between the photosynthesis-carbohydrates-growth continuum and the circadian rhythm is thus required.</p>
