Providing resources from Earth is not cost-efficient, and resupply missions are not viable to meet the needs of long-term life in deep space conditions. Plants in space can provide a source of nutrition and oxygen, reducing the reliance on packaged foods, reducing resupply needs, and extending the duration of missions. Using lunar regolith simulant, we employ a novel methodology to create a sustainable and productive growth medium to support the cultivation of horticultural crops on the Moon. Implementing microbial soil regeneration mechanisms derived from Earth, we leverage the interaction between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Vermicompost (VC) to create a fertile LRS matrix. These amendments can sequester toxic contaminants, improve soil structure, and increase plant stress tolerance. We demonstrate the ability to produce chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in lunar regolith simulant augmented with AMF and VC under climate-controlled conditions. We cultivated chickpea to seed in a mixture containing 75% Lunar Regolith Simulant. Preliminary results suggest that higher LRS contents induce heightened stress responses. However, plants grown in 100% LRS inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated an average two-week survival extension compared to non-inoculated plants. This study provides, for the first time, a baseline for chickpea germination in varying mixtures of LRS and VC and will inform future studies as humanity goes back to the Moon.\nHibiscus bullseyes reveal mechanisms controlling petal pattern proportions that influence plant-pollinator interactions\nAuthors: Riglet, L.; Zardilis, A.; Fairnie, A. L.; Yeo, M. T. S.; Jonsson, H.; Moyroud, E.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.579006\nColourful patterns on flower corollas are key signals to attract pollinators. The formation of such motifs relies on the establishment of developmental boundaries that partition the growing petal epidermis into different subdomains, where cells can produce specific pigments and acquire distinctive cell shapes and textures. While some of the transcription factors and biosynthetic pathways producing these characteristics as cell differentiate have been extensively studied, the upstream processes restricting the activities of molecular players to specific regions of the petal epidermis remain enigmatic. Here, we unveil that the petal surface of Hibiscus trionum, an emerging model system featuring a bullseye on its corolla, is pre-patterned as the position of the bullseye boundary is specified long before the motif becomes visible to the human eye. Using a 1-D computational model, we explore how a boundary established at such an early stage can be maintained throughout development. Reciprocally, by exploiting transgenic lines and natural variants, we show that plants can regulate the relative position of the boundary during the pre-patterning phase or modulate division and growth on either side of this boundary at later developmental stages to yield variations in final bullseye proportions. Finally, we provide evidence that such modifications in bullseye size have functional significance as buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can reliably identify a food source based on the size of its bullseye. Notably, we found that individuals exhibit a clear preference for the larger bullseye of H. trionum over the smaller pattern of its close relative, H. richardsonii.\nPhototropin connects blue light perception to starch metabolism in green algae\nAuthors: Yuan, Y.; Iannetta, A.

A.; Kepesidis, G.; Falconet, D.; Thevenon, E.; Tardif, M.; Brugiere, S.; Coute, Y.; Kleman, J.-P.; Sizova, I.; Schilling, M.; Jouhet, J.; Hegemann, P.; Li-Beisson, Y.; Nikoloski, Z.; Bastien, O.; Hicks, L. M.; Petroutsos, D.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.12.579879\nIn photosynthetic organisms light acts as an environmental signal to control their development and physiology, and as energy source to drive the conversion of CO2 into carbohydrates used for growth or storage. The main storage carbohydrate in green algae is starch, which accumulates during the day and is broken down at night to meet cellular energy demands. The signalling role of light quality in the regulation of starch accumulation remains unexplored. Here, we report that in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii blue light perceived by the photoreceptor PHOTOTROPIN causes dephosphorylation of the PHOTOTROPIN-MEDIATED SIGNALLING KINASE 1 that then suppresses starch accumulation by inhibiting the expression of GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE. Our results provide an in-depth view of how photoreceptor-mediated signalling controls microalgal carbon metabolism.\nABCC10 roles in plant development and the transport of indole-3-butyric acid\nAuthors: Homayouni, A.; Damodaran, S.; Schreiber, K.; Michniewicz, M.; Gunther, L.; Strader, L. C.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579300\nProper spatiotemporal distribution of the phytohormone auxin throughout plant tissues mediates a variety of developmental processes. Auxin levels are tightly regulated via de novo synthesis, transport, and conversion from its conjugated forms and precursors. These levels can be regulated through conversion of the auxin precursor, indole 3-butyric acid (IBA), into the active auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), in a peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation process. Defects in IBA-to-IAA conversion cause multiple developmental defects in Arabidopsis, demonstrating IBA-derived IAA is physiologically important to the active auxin pool. Similar to IAA, transport of IBA modulates development. However, the mechanisms governing transport of this molecule remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a mutation in the ABCC10 gene of Arabidopsis that suppresses the abcg36 hypersensitivity to IBA and its synthetic analog, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy butyric acid (2,4-DB) and the abcg36 hyperaccumulation of [3H]-IBA. We found that ABCC10 acts as a direct vacuolar transporter of IBA. Further, ABCC10 is necessary for proper development of the root apical meristem and leaf tissue. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized method of IBA transport that regulates aspects of plant development.\nLarge-scale multi-omics analyses identified root-microbiome associations underlying plant nitrogen nutrition\nAuthors: Li, N.; Li, G.; Wang, D.; Ma, L.; Huang, X.; Bai, Z.; Wang, Y.; Luo, M.; Luo, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Cao, X.; Feng, Q.; Xu, Y.; Mu, J.; An, R.; Yang, C.; Chen, H.; Li, X.; Dong, Y.; Zhao, J.; Jiang, L.; Jiang, Y.; Reif, J.

Nevertheless, the causal interaction between host genetic variation, gene regulation and the impact of the microbiome on the host phenotype remain unknown. Here we generated 1,341 paired root transcriptome, rhizosphere microbiome and root ionome samples and performed a multi-omics analyses of the host-microbe association at the root-soil interface using 175 rapeseeds (Brassica napus L.) resequenced ecotypes at two field environments. We observed the highest statistically explained variance for root nitrogen uptake among natural ionomic variation by overall transcriptome-wide gene expression and microbial abundance variation. Moreover, we identified significant genome-wide associations for 203 highly heritable amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at multiple genetic loci regulated by eQTL hotspots associated with nitrogen metabolism components. These associations involved a central bacterial genus (Sphingopyxis), which plays a dominant role on gene regulatory effect on its variation regulated by eQTL hotspots. In addition, we performed high-throughput bacterial cultivation from rapeseed roots and subjected Sphingopyxis to whole genome sequencing. Finally, targeted metabolite profiling and confocal imaging assays demonstrated a host-microbiome regulatory effect on Sphingopyxis established by lateral root development and plant nitrogen nutrition. In summary, our integrative approach reveals the genetic basis of host-microbiome trait associations in the transcriptional, nutritional and environmental domains and suggests that the microbiome might have causal effects on root development with implications towards the breeding of nutrient-efficient crops.\nColonization by orchid mycorrhizal fungi primes induced systemic resistance against a necrotrophic pathogen\nAuthors: Pujasatria, G. C.; Miura, C.; Yamaguchi, K.; Shigenobu, S.; Kaminaka, H.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579401\nOrchids and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) plants evolved independently and have different structures and fungal partners, but they both facilitate nutrient uptake. Orchid mycorrhiza (OM) supports orchid seed germination, but unlike AM, its role in disease resistance of mature plants is largely unknown. Here, we examined whether OM induces systemic disease resistance against a necrotrophic pathogen in a similar fashion to AM. We investigated the priming effect of mycorrhizal fungi inoculation on resistance of a terrestrial orchid, Bletilla striata, to soft rot caused by Dickeya fangzhongdai. We found that root colonization by a compatible OM fungus primed B. striata seedlings and induced systemic resistance against the infection. Transcriptome analysis showed that priming was mediated by the downregulation of jasmonate and ethylene pathways and that these pathways are upregulated once infection occurs. Comparison with the reported transcriptome of AM fungus-colonized rice leaves revealed similar mechanisms in B. striata and in rice. These findings highlight a novel aspect of commonality between OM and AM plants in terms of induced systemic resistance. HighlightColonization by a compatible mycorrhizal fungus primes induced systemic resistance against a necrotrophic pathogen in a terrestrial orchid, Bletilla striata, by regulating jasmonate and ethylene pathways, similar to arbuscular mycorrhizal plants.\nMedicago truncatula ABCG40 is a cytokinin importer that negatively regulates lateral root density and nodule number\nAuthors: Jamruszka, T.; Banasiak, J.; Pawela, A.; Jarzyniak, K.; Xia, J.; Biala, W.; Plackova, L.; Tsering, T.; Iacobini, F. R.; Novak, O.; Geisler, M. M.; Jasinski, M.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.10.516000\nNumerous studies suggest that cytokinin (CK) distribution plays a relevant role in shaping plant morphology in changing environments. Nonetheless, our knowledge about the involvement of short-distance CK translocation in root mineral nutrition remains scarce, and the specific role of CK transporters in root morphology has yet to be established. Therefore, the molecular identity of CK transporters should be determined to increase knowledge on root plasticity during soil fertility, as well as more frequently encountered plant nutrient deficiencies. In this work, we identified and characterized the Medicago truncatula full-size ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter of the G subfamily MtABCG40 as a plasma membrane CK importer. Its expression is root-specific and is induced by nitrogen deprivation and CKs. Our analyses indicate that MtABCG40 exerts a negative impact on lateral root density by decreasing lateral root initiation and enhancing primary root elongation. Moreover, we also observed that this transporter negatively influenced the nodule number. Our results suggest that MtABCG40 action affects CK signalling, which impacts the cellular response to auxin. In summary, we identified a novel ABCG-type CK transporter that regulates lateral root density and nodule number.\nWheat NAC transcription factor NAC5-1 is a positive regulator of senescence\nAuthors: Evans, C.; Mogg, S. L.; Soraru, C.; Wallington, E.; Coates, J. C.; Borrill, P.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578592\nWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important source of both calories and protein in global diets, but there is a trade-off between grain yield and protein content. The timing of leaf senescence could mediate this trade-off as it is associated with both decline in photosynthesis and nitrogen remobilisation from leaves to grain. NAC transcription factors play key roles in regulating senescence timing. In rice, OsNAC5 expression is correlated with earlier senescence, but the role of the wheat ortholog in senescence had not been characterised. We verified that NAC5-1 is the ortholog of OsNAC5 and that it is expressed in senescing flag leaves in wheat. To characterise NAC5-1, we combined missense mutations in NAC5-A1 and NAC5-B1 from a TILLING mutant population and overexpressed NAC5-A1 in wheat. Mutation in NAC5-1 was associated with delayed onset of flag leaf senescence, while overexpression of NAC5-A1 was associated with slightly earlier onset of leaf senescence. DAP-seq was performed to locate transcription factor binding sites of NAC5-1. Analysis of DAP-seq and comparison with other studies identified putative downstream target genes of NAC5-1 which could be associated with senescence. This work showed that NAC5-1 is a positive transcriptional regulator of leaf senescence in wheat. Further research is needed to test the effect of NAC5-1 on yield and protein content in field trials, to assess the potential to exploit this senescence regulator to develop high-yielding wheat while maintaining grain protein content.\nGeometry and cell wall mechanics guide early pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Riglet, L.; Quilliet, C.; Godin, C.; John, K.; Fobis-Loisy, I.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578915\nIn Arabidopsis thaliana, successful fertilization relies on the precise guidance of the pollen tube tip as it navigates through the female pistil tissues to deliver non-motile sperm cells to ovules. While prior studies have unveiled the role of the pistil in directing pollen tubes to ovules, growth guidance mechanisms within the stigmatic epidermis during the initial phase of the pollen tubes journey remains elusive. A recent analysis comparing wild-type (WT) pollen tube paths in WT and ktn1-5 stigmatic cells revealed a tight connection between directed pollen tube growth and the mechanical properties of the invaded stigmatic cell. Building upon these observations, we constructed here a mathematical model to explore the mechanisms guiding early pollen tube growth through the papilla cell wall (CW). We found that in ktn1-5, the pollen tube moves freely on the curved papilla surface, following geodesics, while the WT papilla exerts directional guidance on the pollen tube. An order of magnitude analysis of the mechanical forces involved in pollen tube growth in papillae suggests a guidance mechanism, where the elongated papilla geometry and the CW elasticity combine to efficiently direct pollen tube growth towards the papilla base.\nPhotoprotective mechanisms in Elysia species hosting Acetabularia chloroplasts shed light on host-donor compatibility in photosynthetic sea slugs\nAuthors: Morelli, L.; Havurinne, V.; Madeira, D.; Martins, P.; Cartaxana, P.; Cruz, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578635\nSacoglossa sea slugs have garnered attention due to their ability to retain intracellular functional chloroplasts from algae, while degrading other algal cell components. While protective mechanisms that limit oxidative damage under excessive light are well documented in plants and algae, the photoprotective strategies employed by these photosynthetic sea slugs remain unresolved. Species within the genus Elysia are known to retain chloroplasts from various algal sources, but the extent to which the metabolic processes from the donor algae can be sustained by the sea slugs is unclear. By comparing their responses to high light conditions through kinetic analyses, molecular techniques, and biochemical assays, this study highlights significant differences between two photosynthetic Elysia species with chloroplasts derived from the green alga Acetabularia acetabulum. Notably, Elysia timida displayed remarkable tolerance to high light stress and sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms such as an active xanthophyll cycle, efficient D1 protein recycling, accumulation of heat-shock proteins and -tocopherol. In contrast, Elysia crispata exhibited absence or limitations in these photoprotective strategies. Our findings emphasize the intricate relationship between the host animal and the stolen chloroplasts, highlighting different capacities to protect the photosynthetic organelle from oxidative damage.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Food sustainability is one of the most significant barriers to long-term space travel. Providing resources from Earth is not cost-efficient, and resupply missions are not viable to meet the needs of long-term life in deep space conditions. Plants in space can provide a source of nutrition and oxygen, reducing the reliance on packaged foods, reducing resupply needs, and extending the duration of missions. Using lunar regolith simulant, we employ a novel methodology to create a sustainable and productive growth medium to support the cultivation of horticultural crops on the Moon. Implementing microbial soil regeneration mechanisms derived from Earth, we leverage the interaction between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Vermicompost (VC) to create a fertile LRS matrix. These amendments can sequester toxic contaminants, improve soil structure, and increase plant stress tolerance. We demonstrate the ability to produce chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in lunar regolith simulant augmented with AMF and VC under climate-controlled conditions. We cultivated chickpea to seed in a mixture containing 75% Lunar Regolith Simulant. Preliminary results suggest that higher LRS contents induce heightened stress responses. However, plants grown in 100% LRS inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated an average two-week survival extension compared to non-inoculated plants. This study provides, for the first time, a baseline for chickpea germination in varying mixtures of LRS and VC and will inform future studies as humanity goes back to the Moon.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Colourful patterns on flower corollas are key signals to attract pollinators. The formation of such motifs relies on the establishment of developmental boundaries that partition the growing petal epidermis into different subdomains, where cells can produce specific pigments and acquire distinctive cell shapes and textures. While some of the transcription factors and biosynthetic pathways producing these characteristics as cell differentiate have been extensively studied, the upstream processes restricting the activities of molecular players to specific regions of the petal epidermis remain enigmatic. Here, we unveil that the petal surface of Hibiscus trionum, an emerging model system featuring a bullseye on its corolla, is pre-patterned as the position of the bullseye boundary is specified long before the motif becomes visible to the human eye. Using a 1-D computational model, we explore how a boundary established at such an early stage can be maintained throughout development. Reciprocally, by exploiting transgenic lines and natural variants, we show that plants can regulate the relative position of the boundary during the pre-patterning phase or modulate division and growth on either side of this boundary at later developmental stages to yield variations in final bullseye proportions. Finally, we provide evidence that such modifications in bullseye size have functional significance as buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can reliably identify a food source based on the size of its bullseye. Notably, we found that individuals exhibit a clear preference for the larger bullseye of H. trionum over the smaller pattern of its close relative, H. richardsonii.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In photosynthetic organisms light acts as an environmental signal to control their development and physiology, and as energy source to drive the conversion of CO2 into carbohydrates used for growth or storage. The main storage carbohydrate in green algae is starch, which accumulates during the day and is broken down at night to meet cellular energy demands. The signalling role of light quality in the regulation of starch accumulation remains unexplored. Here, we report that in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii blue light perceived by the photoreceptor PHOTOTROPIN causes dephosphorylation of the PHOTOTROPIN-MEDIATED SIGNALLING KINASE 1 that then suppresses starch accumulation by inhibiting the expression of GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE. Our results provide an in-depth view of how photoreceptor-mediated signalling controls microalgal carbon metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Proper spatiotemporal distribution of the phytohormone auxin throughout plant tissues mediates a variety of developmental processes. Auxin levels are tightly regulated via de novo synthesis, transport, and conversion from its conjugated forms and precursors. These levels can be regulated through conversion of the auxin precursor, indole 3-butyric acid (IBA), into the active auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), in a peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation process. Defects in IBA-to-IAA conversion cause multiple developmental defects in Arabidopsis, demonstrating IBA-derived IAA is physiologically important to the active auxin pool. Similar to IAA, transport of IBA modulates development. However, the mechanisms governing transport of this molecule remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a mutation in the ABCC10 gene of Arabidopsis that suppresses the abcg36 hypersensitivity to IBA and its synthetic analog, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy butyric acid (2,4-DB) and the abcg36 hyperaccumulation of [3H]-IBA. We found that ABCC10 acts as a direct vacuolar transporter of IBA. Further, ABCC10 is necessary for proper development of the root apical meristem and leaf tissue. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized method of IBA transport that regulates aspects of plant development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microbiome determines the performance and fitness of the host plant. Nevertheless, the causal interaction between host genetic variation, gene regulation and the impact of the microbiome on the host phenotype remain unknown. Here we generated 1,341 paired root transcriptome, rhizosphere microbiome and root ionome samples and performed a multi-omics analyses of the host-microbe association at the root-soil interface using 175 rapeseeds (Brassica napus L.) resequenced ecotypes at two field environments. We observed the highest statistically explained variance for root nitrogen uptake among natural ionomic variation by overall transcriptome-wide gene expression and microbial abundance variation. Moreover, we identified significant genome-wide associations for 203 highly heritable amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at multiple genetic loci regulated by eQTL hotspots associated with nitrogen metabolism components. These associations involved a central bacterial genus (Sphingopyxis), which plays a dominant role on gene regulatory effect on its variation regulated by eQTL hotspots. In addition, we performed high-throughput bacterial cultivation from rapeseed roots and subjected Sphingopyxis to whole genome sequencing. Finally, targeted metabolite profiling and confocal imaging assays demonstrated a host-microbiome regulatory effect on Sphingopyxis established by lateral root development and plant nitrogen nutrition. In summary, our integrative approach reveals the genetic basis of host-microbiome trait associations in the transcriptional, nutritional and environmental domains and suggests that the microbiome might have causal effects on root development with implications towards the breeding of nutrient-efficient crops.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Orchids and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) plants evolved independently and have different structures and fungal partners, but they both facilitate nutrient uptake. Orchid mycorrhiza (OM) supports orchid seed germination, but unlike AM, its role in disease resistance of mature plants is largely unknown. Here, we examined whether OM induces systemic disease resistance against a necrotrophic pathogen in a similar fashion to AM. We investigated the priming effect of mycorrhizal fungi inoculation on resistance of a terrestrial orchid, Bletilla striata, to soft rot caused by Dickeya fangzhongdai. We found that root colonization by a compatible OM fungus primed B. striata seedlings and induced systemic resistance against the infection. Transcriptome analysis showed that priming was mediated by the downregulation of jasmonate and ethylene pathways and that these pathways are upregulated once infection occurs. Comparison with the reported transcriptome of AM fungus-colonized rice leaves revealed similar mechanisms in B. striata and in rice. These findings highlight a novel aspect of commonality between OM and AM plants in terms of induced systemic resistance.

        <p class="abstract">Numerous studies suggest that cytokinin (CK) distribution plays a relevant role in shaping plant morphology in changing environments. Nonetheless, our knowledge about the involvement of short-distance CK translocation in root mineral nutrition remains scarce, and the specific role of CK transporters in root morphology has yet to be established. Therefore, the molecular identity of CK transporters should be determined to increase knowledge on root plasticity during soil fertility, as well as more frequently encountered plant nutrient deficiencies. In this work, we identified and characterized the Medicago truncatula full-size ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter of the G subfamily MtABCG40 as a plasma membrane CK importer. Its expression is root-specific and is induced by nitrogen deprivation and CKs. Our analyses indicate that MtABCG40 exerts a negative impact on lateral root density by decreasing lateral root initiation and enhancing primary root elongation. Moreover, we also observed that this transporter negatively influenced the nodule number. Our results suggest that MtABCG40 action affects CK signalling, which impacts the cellular response to auxin. In summary, we identified a novel ABCG-type CK transporter that regulates lateral root density and nodule number.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important source of both calories and protein in global diets, but there is a trade-off between grain yield and protein content. The timing of leaf senescence could mediate this trade-off as it is associated with both decline in photosynthesis and nitrogen remobilisation from leaves to grain. NAC transcription factors play key roles in regulating senescence timing. In rice, OsNAC5 expression is correlated with earlier senescence, but the role of the wheat ortholog in senescence had not been characterised. We verified that NAC5-1 is the ortholog of OsNAC5 and that it is expressed in senescing flag leaves in wheat. To characterise NAC5-1, we combined missense mutations in NAC5-A1 and NAC5-B1 from a TILLING mutant population and overexpressed NAC5-A1 in wheat. Mutation in NAC5-1 was associated with delayed onset of flag leaf senescence, while overexpression of NAC5-A1 was associated with slightly earlier onset of leaf senescence. DAP-seq was performed to locate transcription factor binding sites of NAC5-1. Analysis of DAP-seq and comparison with other studies identified putative downstream target genes of NAC5-1 which could be associated with senescence. This work showed that NAC5-1 is a positive transcriptional regulator of leaf senescence in wheat. Further research is needed to test the effect of NAC5-1 on yield and protein content in field trials, to assess the potential to exploit this senescence regulator to develop high-yielding wheat while maintaining grain protein content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Arabidopsis thaliana, successful fertilization relies on the precise guidance of the pollen tube tip as it navigates through the female pistil tissues to deliver non-motile sperm cells to ovules. While prior studies have unveiled the role of the pistil in directing pollen tubes to ovules, growth guidance mechanisms within the stigmatic epidermis during the initial phase of the pollen tubes journey remains elusive. A recent analysis comparing wild-type (WT) pollen tube paths in WT and ktn1-5 stigmatic cells revealed a tight connection between directed pollen tube growth and the mechanical properties of the invaded stigmatic cell. Building upon these observations, we constructed here a mathematical model to explore the mechanisms guiding early pollen tube growth through the papilla cell wall (CW). We found that in ktn1-5, the pollen tube moves freely on the curved papilla surface, following geodesics, while the WT papilla exerts directional guidance on the pollen tube. An order of magnitude analysis of the mechanical forces involved in pollen tube growth in papillae suggests a guidance mechanism, where the elongated papilla geometry and the CW elasticity combine to efficiently direct pollen tube growth towards the papilla base.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sacoglossa sea slugs have garnered attention due to their ability to retain intracellular functional chloroplasts from algae, while degrading other algal cell components. While protective mechanisms that limit oxidative damage under excessive light are well documented in plants and algae, the photoprotective strategies employed by these photosynthetic sea slugs remain unresolved. Species within the genus Elysia are known to retain chloroplasts from various algal sources, but the extent to which the metabolic processes from the donor algae can be sustained by the sea slugs is unclear. By comparing their responses to high light conditions through kinetic analyses, molecular techniques, and biochemical assays, this study highlights significant differences between two photosynthetic Elysia species with chloroplasts derived from the green alga Acetabularia acetabulum. Notably, Elysia timida displayed remarkable tolerance to high light stress and sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms such as an active xanthophyll cycle, efficient D1 protein recycling, accumulation of heat-shock proteins and -tocopherol. In contrast, Elysia crispata exhibited absence or limitations in these photoprotective strategies. Our findings emphasize the intricate relationship between the host animal and the stolen chloroplasts, highlighting different capacities to protect the photosynthetic organelle from oxidative damage.</p>
