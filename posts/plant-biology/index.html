A.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548689\nMeiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis, while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males. Using single molecule and single-pollen genome sequencing, we describe Teosinte Pollen Drive, an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), that depends on RNA interference (RNAi). 22nt small RNAs from a non-coding RNA hairpin in mexicana depend on Dicer-Like 2 (Dcl2) and target Teosinte Drive Responder 1 (Tdr1), which encodes a lipase required for pollen viability. Dcl2, Tdr1, and the hairpin are in tight pseudolinkage on chromosome 5, but only when transmitted through the male. Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas, and a tightly linked inversion in mexicana spans a major domestication sweep in modern maize. A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals correlated patterns of admixture among unlinked genes required for RNAi on at least 3 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids. Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication and evolution, and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of \"self\" small RNAs in the germlines of plants and animals.\nDataPLAN: a web-based data management plan generator for the plant sciences\nAuthors: Zhou, X.-R.; Beier, S.; Brilhaus, D.; Rodrigues, C. M.; Mühlhaus, T.; von Suchodoletz, D.; Twyman, R. M.; Usadel, B.; Kranz, A.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548147\nResearch Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN -- a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.\nDetection and editing of the updated plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded proteomes for Arabidopsis with PeptideAtlas\nAuthors: van Wijk, K. J.; Bentolila, S.; Leppert, T.; Sun, Q.; Sun, Z.; Mendoza, L.; Li, M.; Deutsch, E. W.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548362\nArabidopsis thaliana Col-0 has plastid and mitochondrial genomes encoding for over one hundred proteins and several ORFs. Public databases (e.g. Araport11) have redundancy and discrepancies in gene identifiers for these organelle-encoded proteins. RNA editing results in changes to specific amino acid residues or creation of start and stop codons for many of these proteins, but the impact of such RNA editing at the protein level is largely unexplored due to the complexities of detection. This study first assembled the non-redundant set of identifiers, their correct protein sequences, and 452 predicted non-synonymous editing sites of which 56 are edited at lower frequency. Accumulation of edited and/or unedited proteoforms was then determined by searching [~]259 million raw MSMS spectra from ProteomeXchange as part of Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/). All mitochondrial proteins and all except three plastid-encoded proteins (NDHG/NDH6, PSBM, RPS16), but none of the ORFs, were identified; we suggest that all ORFs and RPS16 are pseudogenes. Detection frequencies for each edit site and type of edit (e.g. S to L/F) were determined at the protein level, cross-referenced against the metadata (e.g. tissue), and evaluated for technical challenges of detection.167 predicted edit sites were detected at the proteome level. Minor frequency sites were indeed also edited at low frequency at the protein level. However, except for sites RPL5-22 and CCB382-124, proteins only accumulate in edited form (\u003e98 -100% edited) even if RNA editing levels are well below 100%. This study establishes that RNA editing for major editing sites is required for stable protein accumulation.\nEvolutionary Trajectory of Pattern Recognition Receptors in Plants\nAuthors: Ngou, B. P. M.; Wyler, M.; Schmid, M. W.; Kadota, Y.; Shirasu, K.\nScore: 63.8, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547604\nPlants perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate PRR-triggered immunity (PTI). Despite extensive research on PTI in model plant species, the evolutionary trajectory and emergence of PRRs remain elusive. Here we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components among 350 plant species. Our findings reveal that cell-surface receptors comprise two major classes, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs), with RLP being more ancient whereas RLK families have undergone significant expansion. We also demonstrate that multiple downstream signalling components have an ancient origin within the plant lineage. To shed light on the immune-specificity of PRRs, we traced the evolutionary origin of immune-specific leucine-rich repeat-RLPs (LRR-RLPs) in plants. Surprisingly, we discovered that the last four LRR motifs crucial for co-receptor interaction in LRR-RLPs are closely related to those of the LRR-RLK subgroup Xb, which primarily governs growth and development. Functional characterisation further reveals that LRR-RLPs initiate immune responses through their juxtamembrane and transmembrane regions, while LRR-RLK-Xb members regulate development through their cytosolic kinase domains. Our data suggest modular evolution of cell-surface receptors in which immunity- and development-specific cell-surface receptors share a common origin. After diversification, their ectodomains, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions have either diversified or stabilised to recognize ligands that activate different downstream responses. We propose that cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components are ancient, and likely predate the emergence of land plants, subsequently evolving to exhibit greater complexity and specificity within the land plant lineage.\nStand age diversity weakens forests sensitivity to climate change\nAuthors: Vangi, E.; Cioccolo, E.; Marano, G.; Dalmonech, D.; Bianchini, L.; Puchi, P.; Grieco, E.; Colantoni, A.; Chirici, G.; Collalti, A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548709\nForest age is the result of population dynamics, disturbance regimes, silviculture and plays an important role in the global Carbon (C) cycle. To examine the shaping effects of forest age on Carbon budget under current and future climate conditions, we used a biogeochemical-based model in three managed forest stands and then modeled their development as undisturbed systems. The model was forced with climate outputs under four representative climate scenarios over a matrix of 11 age classes for each stand. We find that the Net Primary Production (NPP) peak was reached in the middle-aged class (42- to-70-year-old) regardless of the climate scenario, while total C-woody stocks (tCWS) increased with age with different trajectories in the three sites, but not linearly as expected. Under climate change scenarios, the beech forest shows as expected increasing NPP with increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature as much for younger age classes as for older ones. Conversely, in the spruce and Scots pine dominated sites NPP and tCWS decrease under climate change scenarios. ANOVA analysis applied as factorial analysis to model outputs shows that age and climate scenarios have all effects on forest carbon budget only if taken singularly while their combination reduce if not totally weaken any effect.\nFungal small RNAs ride in extracellular vesicles to enter plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis\nAuthors: He, B.; Wang, H.; Liu, G.; Chen, A.; Cai, Q.; Jin, H.\nScore: 26.0, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545159\nSmall RNAs (sRNAs) of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea can enter plant cells and hijack host Argonaute protein 1 (AGO1) to silence host immunity genes. However, the mechanism by which these fungal sRNAs are secreted and enter host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The B. cinerea tetraspanin protein, Punchless 1 (BcPLS1), serves as an EV biomarker and plays an essential role in fungal pathogenicity. We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that fungi secrete sRNAs via EVs, which then enter host plant cells mainly through CME.\nAn Enhancer Trap system to track developmental dynamics in Marchantia polymorpha\nAuthors: Marron, A. O.; Sauret-Gueto, S.; Rebmann, M.; Silvestri, L.; Tomaselli, M.; Haseloff, J.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547788\nA combination of streamlined genetics, experimental tractability and relative morphological simplicity compared to vascular plants makes the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha an ideal model system for studying many aspects of plant biology. Here we describe a transformation vector combining a constitutive fluorescent membrane marker with a nuclear marker that is regulated by nearby enhancer elements, and use this to produce a library of enhancer trap lines for Marchantia. Screening gemmae from these lines allowed for identification and characterization of novel marker lines, including markers for rhizoids and oil cells. The library allowed the identification of a margin tissue running around the thallus edge, highlighted during thallus development. Expression of this marker is correlated with auxin levels. We generated multiple markers for the meristematic apical notch region, which have different spatial expression patterns, reappear at different times during meristem regeneration following apical notch excision and have varying responses to auxin supplementation or inhibition. This reveals that there are proximodistal substructures within the apical notch that could not be observed otherwise. We employed our markers to study Marchantia sporeling development, observing meristem emergence as defining the protonema-to-prothallus stage transition, and subsequent production of margin tissue during the prothallus stage. Exogenous auxin treatment stalls meristem emergence at the protonema stage but does not inhibit cell division, resulting in callus-like sporelings with many rhizoids, whereas pharmacologically inhibiting auxin synthesis and transport does not prevent meristem emergence. This enhancer trap system presents a useful resource for the community and will contribute to future Marchantia research. Significance StatementThe liverwort Marchantia polymorpha is an emerging model species with huge potential for synthetic biology. We generated an enhancer trap library as a resource for Marchantia research and characterized marker lines for several important cell types (rhizoids, thallus margin, apical notch and oil cells). These marker lines can be used to track cellular dynamics in growing plants, exemplified by studying auxin responses and sporeling growth, revealing new insights into thallus development and cell fate specification.\nRepeated evolution of herbicide resistance in Lolium multiflorum revealed by haplotype-resolved analysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase\nAuthors: Brunharo, C.; Tranel, P.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548383\nHerbicide resistance in weeds is one of the greatest challenges in modern food production. The grass species Lolium multiflorum is an excellent model species to investigate convergent evolution under similar selection pressure because populations have repeatedly evolved resistance to many herbicides, utilizing a multitude of mechanisms to neutralize herbicide damage. In this work, we investigated the gene that encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), the target-site of the most successful herbicide group available for grass weed control. We sampled L. multiflorum populations from agricultural fields with history of intense herbicide use, and studied their response to three ACCase-inhibiting herbicides under controlled conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms of herbicide resistance and the genetic relationship among sampled populations, we resolved the haplotypes of 97 resistant and susceptible individuals by performing an amplicon-seq analysis using long-read DNA sequencing technologies, focusing on the DNA sequence encoding the carboxyl-transferase domain of ACCase. Our dose-response data indicated the existence of many, often unpredictable, resistance patterns to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, where populations exhibited as much as 37-fold reduction in herbicide response. The majority of the populations exhibited resistance to all three herbicides studied. Phylogenetic and molecular genetic analyses revealed multiple evolutionary origins of resistance-endowing ACCase haplotypes, as well as widespread admixture in the region regardless of cropping system. The amplicons generated were very diverse, with haplotypes exhibiting 26 to 110 polymorphisms. Polymorphisms included insertions and deletions 1-31 bp in length, none of which were associated with the resistance phenotype. We also found evidence that some populations have multiple mechanisms of resistance. Our results highlight the astounding genetic diversity in L. multiflorum populations, and the potential for convergent evolution of herbicide resistance across the landscape that challenges weed management and jeopardizes sustainable weed control practices. We provide an in-depth discussion of the evolutionary and practical implications of our results.\nFeatures that Govern Terminator Strength in Plants\nAuthors: Gorjifard, S.; Jores, T.; Tonnies, J.; Mueth, N.

T.; Queitsch, C.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-06-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545379\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe 3 end of a gene, often called a terminator, modulates mRNA stability, localization, translation, and polyadenylation. Here, we adapted Plant STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay, to measure the activity of over 50,000 terminators from the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. We characterize thousands of plant terminators, including many that outperform bacterial terminators commonly used in plants. Terminator activity is species-specific, differing in tobacco leaf and maize protoplast assays. While recapitulating known biology, our results reveal the relative contributions of polyadenylation motifs to terminator strength. We built a computational model to predict terminator strength and used it to conduct in silico evolution that generated optimized synthetic terminators. Additionally, we discover alternative polyadenylation sites across tens of thousands of terminators; however, the strongest terminators tend to have a dominant cleavage site. Our results establish features of plant terminator function and identify strong naturally occurring and synthetic terminators.\nSpatiotemporal distribution of ROS production, delivery and utilization in Arabidopsis root hairs\nAuthors: Kubenova, L.; Haberland, J.; Dvorak, P.; Samaj, J.; Ovecka, M.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.05.522872\nFluorescent selective probes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in living cells are versatile tools for the documentation of ROS production in plant developmental or stress reactions. We employed high-resolution live-cell imaging and semi-quantitative analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana stained with CM-H2DCFDA, CellROXTM Deep Red and AmplexTM Red for functional characterization of spatiotemporal mode of ROS production, delivery and utilization during root hair formation. Cell viability marker fluorescein diacetate served as a positive control for dye-loading and undisturbed tip growth after staining. Colocalization analysis with subcellular molecular markers and utilization of two root hair mutants with similar phenotype of non-elongating root hairs, but with contrast reasons for this impairment, we found that: i) CM-H2DCFDA is a sensitive probe for ROS generation in cytoplasm, ii) CellROXTM Deep Red labels ROS in mitochondria, iii) AmplexTM Red labels apoplastic ROS and mitochondria, and shows high selectivity to root hairs, iv) rhd2-1 mutant with nonfunctional AtRBOHC/RHD2 has a low level of CM-H2DCFDA-reactive ROS in cytoplasm and lacks AmplexTM Red-reactive ROS in apoplast, v) ACTIN2-deficient der1-3 mutant is not altered in these aspects. The sensitivity of CellROXTM Deep Red was documented by discrimination between larger ROS-containing mitochondria and small, yet ROS-free pre-mature mitochondria in the growing tip of root hairs. We characterized spatial changes in ROS production and compartmentalization induced by external ROS modulators, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and ionophore valinomycin. This dynamic and high-resolution study of ROS production and utilization opens new opportunities for precise speciation of particular ROS involved in the root hair formation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Meiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis, while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males. Using single molecule and single-pollen genome sequencing, we describe Teosinte Pollen Drive, an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), that depends on RNA interference (RNAi). 22nt small RNAs from a non-coding RNA hairpin in mexicana depend on Dicer-Like 2 (Dcl2) and target Teosinte Drive Responder 1 (Tdr1), which encodes a lipase required for pollen viability. Dcl2, Tdr1, and the hairpin are in tight pseudolinkage on chromosome 5, but only when transmitted through the male. Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas, and a tightly linked inversion in mexicana spans a major domestication sweep in modern maize. A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals correlated patterns of admixture among unlinked genes required for RNAi on at least 3 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids. Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication and evolution, and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of &#34;self&#34; small RNAs in the germlines of plants and animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Research Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN -- a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 has plastid and mitochondrial genomes encoding for over one hundred proteins and several ORFs. Public databases (e.g. Araport11) have redundancy and discrepancies in gene identifiers for these organelle-encoded proteins. RNA editing results in changes to specific amino acid residues or creation of start and stop codons for many of these proteins, but the impact of such RNA editing at the protein level is largely unexplored due to the complexities of detection. This study first assembled the non-redundant set of identifiers, their correct protein sequences, and 452 predicted non-synonymous editing sites of which 56 are edited at lower frequency. Accumulation of edited and/or unedited proteoforms was then determined by searching [~]259 million raw MSMS spectra from ProteomeXchange as part of Arabidopsis PeptideAtlas (www.peptideatlas.org/builds/arabidopsis/). All mitochondrial proteins and all except three plastid-encoded proteins (NDHG/NDH6, PSBM, RPS16), but none of the ORFs, were identified; we suggest that all ORFs and RPS16 are pseudogenes. Detection frequencies for each edit site and type of edit (e.g. S to L/F) were determined at the protein level, cross-referenced against the metadata (e.g. tissue), and evaluated for technical challenges of detection.167 predicted edit sites were detected at the proteome level. Minor frequency sites were indeed also edited at low frequency at the protein level. However, except for sites RPL5-22 and CCB382-124, proteins only accumulate in edited form (&gt;98 -100% edited) even if RNA editing levels are well below 100%. This study establishes that RNA editing for major editing sites is required for stable protein accumulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate PRR-triggered immunity (PTI). Despite extensive research on PTI in model plant species, the evolutionary trajectory and emergence of PRRs remain elusive. Here we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components among 350 plant species. Our findings reveal that cell-surface receptors comprise two major classes, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs), with RLP being more ancient whereas RLK families have undergone significant expansion. We also demonstrate that multiple downstream signalling components have an ancient origin within the plant lineage. To shed light on the immune-specificity of PRRs, we traced the evolutionary origin of immune-specific leucine-rich repeat-RLPs (LRR-RLPs) in plants. Surprisingly, we discovered that the last four LRR motifs crucial for co-receptor interaction in LRR-RLPs are closely related to those of the LRR-RLK subgroup Xb, which primarily governs growth and development. Functional characterisation further reveals that LRR-RLPs initiate immune responses through their juxtamembrane and transmembrane regions, while LRR-RLK-Xb members regulate development through their cytosolic kinase domains. Our data suggest modular evolution of cell-surface receptors in which immunity- and development-specific cell-surface receptors share a common origin. After diversification, their ectodomains, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions have either diversified or stabilised to recognize ligands that activate different downstream responses. We propose that cell-surface receptors and downstream signalling components are ancient, and likely predate the emergence of land plants, subsequently evolving to exhibit greater complexity and specificity within the land plant lineage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Forest age is the result of population dynamics, disturbance regimes, silviculture and plays an important role in the global Carbon (C) cycle. To examine the shaping effects of forest age on Carbon budget under current and future climate conditions, we used a biogeochemical-based model in three managed forest stands and then modeled their development as undisturbed systems. The model was forced with climate outputs under four representative climate scenarios over a matrix of 11 age classes for each stand. We find that the Net Primary Production (NPP) peak was reached in the middle-aged class (42- to-70-year-old) regardless of the climate scenario, while total C-woody stocks (tCWS) increased with age with different trajectories in the three sites, but not linearly as expected. Under climate change scenarios, the beech forest shows as expected increasing NPP with increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature as much for younger age classes as for older ones. Conversely, in the spruce and Scots pine dominated sites NPP and tCWS decrease under climate change scenarios. ANOVA analysis applied as factorial analysis to model outputs shows that age and climate scenarios have all effects on forest carbon budget only if taken singularly while their combination reduce if not totally weaken any effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small RNAs (sRNAs) of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea can enter plant cells and hijack host Argonaute protein 1 (AGO1) to silence host immunity genes. However, the mechanism by which these fungal sRNAs are secreted and enter host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The B. cinerea tetraspanin protein, Punchless 1 (BcPLS1), serves as an EV biomarker and plays an essential role in fungal pathogenicity. We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that fungi secrete sRNAs via EVs, which then enter host plant cells mainly through CME.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A combination of streamlined genetics, experimental tractability and relative morphological simplicity compared to vascular plants makes the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha an ideal model system for studying many aspects of plant biology. Here we describe a transformation vector combining a constitutive fluorescent membrane marker with a nuclear marker that is regulated by nearby enhancer elements, and use this to produce a library of enhancer trap lines for Marchantia. Screening gemmae from these lines allowed for identification and characterization of novel marker lines, including markers for rhizoids and oil cells. The library allowed the identification of a margin tissue running around the thallus edge, highlighted during thallus development. Expression of this marker is correlated with auxin levels. We generated multiple markers for the meristematic apical notch region, which have different spatial expression patterns, reappear at different times during meristem regeneration following apical notch excision and have varying responses to auxin supplementation or inhibition. This reveals that there are proximodistal substructures within the apical notch that could not be observed otherwise. We employed our markers to study Marchantia sporeling development, observing meristem emergence as defining the protonema-to-prothallus stage transition, and subsequent production of margin tissue during the prothallus stage. Exogenous auxin treatment stalls meristem emergence at the protonema stage but does not inhibit cell division, resulting in callus-like sporelings with many rhizoids, whereas pharmacologically inhibiting auxin synthesis and transport does not prevent meristem emergence. This enhancer trap system presents a useful resource for the community and will contribute to future Marchantia research.

Significance StatementThe liverwort Marchantia polymorpha is an emerging model species with huge potential for synthetic biology. We generated an enhancer trap library as a resource for Marchantia research and characterized marker lines for several important cell types (rhizoids, thallus margin, apical notch and oil cells). These marker lines can be used to track cellular dynamics in growing plants, exemplified by studying auxin responses and sporeling growth, revealing new insights into thallus development and cell fate specification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Herbicide resistance in weeds is one of the greatest challenges in modern food production. The grass species Lolium multiflorum is an excellent model species to investigate convergent evolution under similar selection pressure because populations have repeatedly evolved resistance to many herbicides, utilizing a multitude of mechanisms to neutralize herbicide damage. In this work, we investigated the gene that encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), the target-site of the most successful herbicide group available for grass weed control. We sampled L. multiflorum populations from agricultural fields with history of intense herbicide use, and studied their response to three ACCase-inhibiting herbicides under controlled conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms of herbicide resistance and the genetic relationship among sampled populations, we resolved the haplotypes of 97 resistant and susceptible individuals by performing an amplicon-seq analysis using long-read DNA sequencing technologies, focusing on the DNA sequence encoding the carboxyl-transferase domain of ACCase. Our dose-response data indicated the existence of many, often unpredictable, resistance patterns to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, where populations exhibited as much as 37-fold reduction in herbicide response. The majority of the populations exhibited resistance to all three herbicides studied. Phylogenetic and molecular genetic analyses revealed multiple evolutionary origins of resistance-endowing ACCase haplotypes, as well as widespread admixture in the region regardless of cropping system. The amplicons generated were very diverse, with haplotypes exhibiting 26 to 110 polymorphisms. Polymorphisms included insertions and deletions 1-31 bp in length, none of which were associated with the resistance phenotype. We also found evidence that some populations have multiple mechanisms of resistance. Our results highlight the astounding genetic diversity in L. multiflorum populations, and the potential for convergent evolution of herbicide resistance across the landscape that challenges weed management and jeopardizes sustainable weed control practices. We provide an in-depth discussion of the evolutionary and practical implications of our results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe 3 end of a gene, often called a terminator, modulates mRNA stability, localization, translation, and polyadenylation. Here, we adapted Plant STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay, to measure the activity of over 50,000 terminators from the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. We characterize thousands of plant terminators, including many that outperform bacterial terminators commonly used in plants. Terminator activity is species-specific, differing in tobacco leaf and maize protoplast assays. While recapitulating known biology, our results reveal the relative contributions of polyadenylation motifs to terminator strength. We built a computational model to predict terminator strength and used it to conduct in silico evolution that generated optimized synthetic terminators. Additionally, we discover alternative polyadenylation sites across tens of thousands of terminators; however, the strongest terminators tend to have a dominant cleavage site. Our results establish features of plant terminator function and identify strong naturally occurring and synthetic terminators.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fluorescent selective probes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection in living cells are versatile tools for the documentation of ROS production in plant developmental or stress reactions. We employed high-resolution live-cell imaging and semi-quantitative analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana stained with CM-H2DCFDA, CellROXTM Deep Red and AmplexTM Red for functional characterization of spatiotemporal mode of ROS production, delivery and utilization during root hair formation. Cell viability marker fluorescein diacetate served as a positive control for dye-loading and undisturbed tip growth after staining. Colocalization analysis with subcellular molecular markers and utilization of two root hair mutants with similar phenotype of non-elongating root hairs, but with contrast reasons for this impairment, we found that: i) CM-H2DCFDA is a sensitive probe for ROS generation in cytoplasm, ii) CellROXTM Deep Red labels ROS in mitochondria, iii) AmplexTM Red labels apoplastic ROS and mitochondria, and shows high selectivity to root hairs, iv) rhd2-1 mutant with nonfunctional AtRBOHC/RHD2 has a low level of CM-H2DCFDA-reactive ROS in cytoplasm and lacks AmplexTM Red-reactive ROS in apoplast, v) ACTIN2-deficient der1-3 mutant is not altered in these aspects. The sensitivity of CellROXTM Deep Red was documented by discrimination between larger ROS-containing mitochondria and small, yet ROS-free pre-mature mitochondria in the growing tip of root hairs. We characterized spatial changes in ROS production and compartmentalization induced by external ROS modulators, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and ionophore valinomycin. This dynamic and high-resolution study of ROS production and utilization opens new opportunities for precise speciation of particular ROS involved in the root hair formation.</p>
