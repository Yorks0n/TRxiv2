  "articleBody": " The phosphorylation landscape of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus\nAuthors: Cruz-Mireles, N.; Oses-Ruiz, M.; Derbyshire, P.; Jegousse, C.; Ryder, L. S.; Bautista, M.-J.; Eseola, A. B.; Tang, B.; Yan, X.; Ma, W.; Findlay, K. C.; Were, V.; MacLean, D.; Talbot, N. J.; Menke, F. L. H.\nScore: 68.9, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553964\nMany of the worlds most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens which elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during fungal infection. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring to identify phosphoproteins directly regulated by the Pmk1 MAP kinase that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 33 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of a newly identified regulator, Vts1, is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for control of plant diseases.\nAn ancient role for the CYP73 gene family in t-cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and embryophyte development\nAuthors: Knosp, S.; Kriegshauser, L.; Tatsumi, K.; Malherbe, L.; Wiedemann, G.; Bakan, B.; Kohchi, T.; Reski, R.; Renault, H.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.551634\nThe phenylpropanoid pathway is a plant metabolism intimately linked to the transition to terrestrial life. It produces phenolic compounds that play essential roles in stress mitigation and ecological interactions. The pathway also provides the building blocks for hydrophobic polymers that form apoplastic diffusion barriers and make up a significant fraction of the land plant biomass. Despite its significance in embryophytes (i.e., land plants), the origin and evolutionary history of the phenylpropanoid pathway remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the organization and function of the pathway in bryophytes, the non-vascular embryophytes. In this study, we conducted a multidisciplinary analysis of the CYP73 gene family that encodes t-cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), the first plant-specific enzyme in the pathway. Our results indicate that C4H activity originated with the emergence of the CYP73 gene family in an ancestor of land plants and was supported by an arginine residue that stabilizes its substrate in the active site. C4H deficiency in the moss Physcomitrium patens, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis resulted in a shortage of phenylpropanoids and abnormal plant development. The latter could be rescued in the moss by the exogenous supply of p-coumaric acid, the product of C4H. Our findings establish the emergence of the CYP73 gene family as a foundational event for the development of the canonical plant phenylpropanoid pathway and underscores the deep-rooted conservation of the C4H enzyme function in embryophyte biology.\nPectin methylesterase activity is required for RALF1 peptide signalling output\nAuthors: Roessling, A.-K.; Dunser, K.; Kalmbach, L.; Barbez, E.; Kleine-Vehn, J.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553913\nThe extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular peptides largely remains unknown. RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.\nSpatiotemporally distinct responses to mechanical forces shape the developing seed of Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Bauer, A.; Bied, C.; Delattre, A.; Ingram, G.; Golz, J. F.; Landrein, B.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554152\nOrgan morphogenesis depends on mechanical interactions between cells and tissues. These interactions generate forces that can be sensed by cells and affect key cellular processes. However, how mechanical forces contribute, together with biochemical signals, to the shaping of complex organs is still unclear. We address this question using the seed of Arabidopsis as a model system. We show that seeds first experience a phase of high anisotropic growth that is dependent on the response of cortical microtubule (CMT) to forces, which guide cellulose deposition according to shape-driven stresses in the outermost layer of the seed coat. However, at later stages of development, we show that seed growth is isotropic and depend on the properties of an inner layer of the seed coat that stiffens its walls in response to tension but has isotropic material properties. Finally, we show that the transition from anisotropic to isotropic growth is due to dampening of CMT responses to shape-driven stresses. Altogether, our work support that spatiotemporally distinct mechanical responses control the shape of developing seeds in Arabidopsis.\nA high-resolution gene expression atlas of the medial and lateral domains of the gynoecium of Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Luna-Garcia, V.; Bernal-Gallardo, J. J.; Rethoret-Pasty, M.; Pasha, A.; Provart, N. J.; de Folter, S.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553994\nAngiosperms are characterized by the formation of flowers, and in their inner floral whorl, one or various gynoecia are produced. These female reproductive structures are responsible for fruit and seed production, thus ensuring the reproductive competence of angiosperms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the gynoecium is composed of two fused carpels with different tissues that need to develop and differentiate to consolidate a mature gynoecium and thus the reproductive competence of Arabidopsis. For these reasons, they have become the object of study for floral and fruit development. However, due to the complexity of the gynoecium, specific spatio-temporal tissues expression patterns are still scarce. In this study, we used precise laser-assisted microdissection and high-throughput RNA sequencing to describe the transcriptional profiles of the medial and lateral domain tissues of the Arabidopsis gynoecium. We provide evidence that the method used is reliable and that, in addition to corroborating gene expression patterns of previously reported regulators of these tissues, we found genes whose expression dynamics point to being involved in cytokinin and auxin homeostasis and in cell cycle progression. Furthermore, based on differential gene expression analyses, we functionally characterized several genes and found that they are involved in gynoecium development. This new resource is available via the Arabidopsis eFP browser and will serve the community in future studies on developmental and reproductive biology.\nGreen Index: a widely accessible method to quantify greenness of photosynthetic organisms\nAuthors: Signorelli, S.; Casaretto, E.; Millar, A. H.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554481\nPlant phenotyping involves the quantitative determination of complex plant traits using image analysis. One important parameter is how green plant tissues appear to the observer, which is indicative of their health and developmental stage. Various formulas have been developed to quantify this by calculating leaf greenness scores. We have developed a revised formula called \"Green Index\" (GI) devised out of the need to quantitatively assess how the apparent greenness of seedlings changes during de-etiolation. The GI calculation is simple, uses widely available RGB values of pixels in images as input, and does not require commercial software platforms or advanced computational skills. In this study we describe the conception of the GI formula, compare it with other widely used greenness formulas, and test its wider application in plant phenotyping using the open source free software platform RawTherapee. We demonstrate the utility of the GI in addressing common issues encountered in assessing plant biology experiments, underscoring its potential as a reliable and accessible tool. Finally, we explore the correlation between GI and chlorophyll content, assess its reliance on different types of photography, and summarizes the key steps for its effective utilization.\nHelper NLRs Nrc2 and Nrc3 act co-dependently with Prf/Pto and activate MAPK signaling to induce immunity in tomato\nAuthors: Zhang, N.; Gan, J.; Carneal, L.; Gonzalez-Tobon, J.; Filiatrault, M.; Martin, G. B.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553711\nPlant intracellular immune receptors, primarily nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), can detect virulence proteins (effectors) from pathogens and activate NLR-triggered immunity (NTI). Recently, sensor NLRs have been reported to function with helper NLRs to activate immune responses. We investigated the role of two helper NLRs, Nrc2 (NLR required for cell death 2) and Nrc3, on immunity in tomato to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) mediated by the sensor NLR Prf and the Pto kinase. Loss-of-function mutations in both Nrc2 and Nrc3 completely compromised Prf/Pto-mediated NTI to Pst containing the cognate effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. An nrc3 mutant showed intermediate susceptibility between wild-type tomato plants and a Prf mutant, while an nrc2 mutant developed only mild disease symptoms. These observations indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act additively to contribute to Prf/Pto-mediated immunity. We also examined at what point Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in the Prf/Pto-mediated immune response. In the nrc2/3 mutant, programmed cell death (PCD) normally induced by constitutively-active variants of AvrPtoB, Pto or Prf was abolished, but that induced by M3K or Mkk2 was not. PCD induced by a constitutively active variant of Nrc3 was also abolished in a Nicotiana benthamiana line with reduced expression of Prf. MAPK activation triggered by expression of AvrPto in the wild-type Pto-expressing tomato plants was completely abolished in the nrc2/3 mutant. These results indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in concert with Prf/Pto and upstream of MAPK signaling. Nrc2 and Nrc3 were not required for the HR triggered by Ptr1, another sensor NLR mediating Pst resistance, although these helper NLRs do appear to be involved in resistance to certain Pst race 1 strains.\nA pectin-binding peptide with a structural and signaling role in the assembly of the plant cell wall\nAuthors: Schoenaers, S.; Lee, H. K.; Gonneau, M.; Faucher, E.; Levasseur, T.; Akary, E.; Claeijs, N.; Moussu, S.; Broyart, C.; Balcerowicz, D.; AbdElgawad, H.; Bassi, A.; Santa Cruz Damineli, D.; Costa, A.; Feijo, J. A.; Moreau, C.; Bonnin, E.; Cathala, B.; Santiago, J.; Hofte, H.; Vissenberg, K.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554416\nPressurized cells with strong walls make up the hydrostatic skeleton of plants. Assembly and expansion of such stressed walls depend on a family of secreted RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides which, curiously, bind both a membrane receptor complex and wall-localized LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSINs (LRXs) in a mutually exclusive way. Here we show that, in root hairs, the RALF22 peptide has a dual structural and signaling role in cell expansion. Together with LRX1, it directs the compaction of charged pectin polymers at the root hair tip into periodic circumferential rings. Free RALF22 induces the formation of a complex with LORELEI-LIKE-GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) and FERONIA (FER), triggering adaptive cellular responses. These findings show how a peptide simultaneously functions as a structural component organizing cell wall architecture and as a signaling molecule that regulates this process. This mechanism may also underlie wall assembly and expansion in other plant cell types.\nBacterial pathogens deliver water/solute-permeable channels as a virulence strategy\nAuthors: Nomura, K.; Andreazza, F.; Cheng, J.; Dong, K.; Zhou, P.; He, S. Y.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.547699\nMany animal and plant pathogenic bacteria utilize a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the host cell1,2. Elucidation of how these effector proteins function in the host cell is critical for understanding infectious diseases in animals and plants3-5. The widely conserved AvrE/DspE-family effectors play a central role in the pathogenesis of diverse phytopathogenic bacteria6. These conserved effectors are involved in the induction of \"water-soaking\" and host cell death that are conducive to bacterial multiplication in infected tissues. However, the exact biochemical functions of AvrE/DspE-family effectors have been recalcitrant to mechanistic understanding for three decades. Here we show that AvrE/DspE-family effectors fold into a {beta}-barrel structure that resembles bacterial porins. Expression of AvrE and DspE in Xenopus oocytes results in (i) inward and outward currents, (ii) permeability to water and (iii) osmolarity-dependent oocyte swelling and bursting. Liposome reconstitution confirmed that the DspE channel alone is sufficient to allow the passage of small molecules such as fluorescein dye. Targeted screening of chemical blockers based on the predicted pore size (15-20 [A]) of the DspE channel identified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as inhibitors of the DspE/AvrE channels. Remarkably, PAMAMs broadly inhibit AvrE/DspE virulence activities in Xenopus oocytes and during Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae infections. Thus, we have unraveled the enigmatic function of a centrally important family of bacterial effectors with significant conceptual and practical implications in the study of bacterial pathogenesis.\nChitosan stimulates root hair callose deposition and inhibits root hair growth\nAuthors: Drs, M.; Haluska, S.; Skrabalkova, E.; Krupar, P.; Potocka, A.; Brejskova, L.; Muller, K.; Serrano, N.; Voxeur, A.; Vernhettes, S.; Ortmannova, J.; Caldarescu, G.; Fendrych, M.; Potocky, M.; Zarsky, V.; Pecenkova, T.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551171\nAlthough angiosperm plants have a general capacity to react after the immunity elicitor chitin or chitosan treatment by the cell wall callose deposition, this response in particular cell types and its evolutionary conservation is not understood. Here we show that also the growing root hairs (RHs) of Arabidopsis can respond to a mild (0.001%) chitosan treatment by the callose deposition and by a deceleration of the RH growth. We demonstrate that the glucan synthase-like 5 (GSL5)/PMR4 is vital for chitosan-induced callose deposition but not for RH growth inhibition. Upon the higher chitosan concentration (0.01%) treatment, RHs do not deposit callose, while growth inhibition is prominent. To understand the specificities of the low and high concentration chitosan treatments, we analysed the corresponding PTI signalling components, gene expression, and RH cellular endomembrane and cytoskeleton modifications. Importantly, chitosan-induced callose deposition is also present in the functionally analogous and evolutionarily only distantly related RH-like structures rhizophores (lycophytes) and rhizoids (bryophytes). Our results point to the RH callose deposition as a conserved strategy of soil-anchoring plant cells (rhizoids/rhizophores/RHs) to deal with mild biotic stress. At the same time, high chitosan concentration prominently disturbs intracellular dynamics, tip-localised endomembrane compartments and RH growth, precluding callose deposition.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Many of the worlds most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens which elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during fungal infection. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring to identify phosphoproteins directly regulated by the Pmk1 MAP kinase that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 33 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of a newly identified regulator, Vts1, is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for control of plant diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The phenylpropanoid pathway is a plant metabolism intimately linked to the transition to terrestrial life. It produces phenolic compounds that play essential roles in stress mitigation and ecological interactions. The pathway also provides the building blocks for hydrophobic polymers that form apoplastic diffusion barriers and make up a significant fraction of the land plant biomass. Despite its significance in embryophytes (i.e., land plants), the origin and evolutionary history of the phenylpropanoid pathway remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the organization and function of the pathway in bryophytes, the non-vascular embryophytes. In this study, we conducted a multidisciplinary analysis of the CYP73 gene family that encodes t-cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), the first plant-specific enzyme in the pathway. Our results indicate that C4H activity originated with the emergence of the CYP73 gene family in an ancestor of land plants and was supported by an arginine residue that stabilizes its substrate in the active site. C4H deficiency in the moss Physcomitrium patens, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis resulted in a shortage of phenylpropanoids and abnormal plant development. The latter could be rescued in the moss by the exogenous supply of p-coumaric acid, the product of C4H. Our findings establish the emergence of the CYP73 gene family as a foundational event for the development of the canonical plant phenylpropanoid pathway and underscores the deep-rooted conservation of the C4H enzyme function in embryophyte biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular peptides largely remains unknown. RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organ morphogenesis depends on mechanical interactions between cells and tissues. These interactions generate forces that can be sensed by cells and affect key cellular processes. However, how mechanical forces contribute, together with biochemical signals, to the shaping of complex organs is still unclear. We address this question using the seed of Arabidopsis as a model system. We show that seeds first experience a phase of high anisotropic growth that is dependent on the response of cortical microtubule (CMT) to forces, which guide cellulose deposition according to shape-driven stresses in the outermost layer of the seed coat. However, at later stages of development, we show that seed growth is isotropic and depend on the properties of an inner layer of the seed coat that stiffens its walls in response to tension but has isotropic material properties. Finally, we show that the transition from anisotropic to isotropic growth is due to dampening of CMT responses to shape-driven stresses. Altogether, our work support that spatiotemporally distinct mechanical responses control the shape of developing seeds in Arabidopsis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Angiosperms are characterized by the formation of flowers, and in their inner floral whorl, one or various gynoecia are produced. These female reproductive structures are responsible for fruit and seed production, thus ensuring the reproductive competence of angiosperms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the gynoecium is composed of two fused carpels with different tissues that need to develop and differentiate to consolidate a mature gynoecium and thus the reproductive competence of Arabidopsis. For these reasons, they have become the object of study for floral and fruit development. However, due to the complexity of the gynoecium, specific spatio-temporal tissues expression patterns are still scarce. In this study, we used precise laser-assisted microdissection and high-throughput RNA sequencing to describe the transcriptional profiles of the medial and lateral domain tissues of the Arabidopsis gynoecium. We provide evidence that the method used is reliable and that, in addition to corroborating gene expression patterns of previously reported regulators of these tissues, we found genes whose expression dynamics point to being involved in cytokinin and auxin homeostasis and in cell cycle progression. Furthermore, based on differential gene expression analyses, we functionally characterized several genes and found that they are involved in gynoecium development. This new resource is available via the Arabidopsis eFP browser and will serve the community in future studies on developmental and reproductive biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant phenotyping involves the quantitative determination of complex plant traits using image analysis. One important parameter is how green plant tissues appear to the observer, which is indicative of their health and developmental stage. Various formulas have been developed to quantify this by calculating leaf greenness scores. We have developed a revised formula called &#34;Green Index&#34; (GI) devised out of the need to quantitatively assess how the apparent greenness of seedlings changes during de-etiolation. The GI calculation is simple, uses widely available RGB values of pixels in images as input, and does not require commercial software platforms or advanced computational skills. In this study we describe the conception of the GI formula, compare it with other widely used greenness formulas, and test its wider application in plant phenotyping using the open source free software platform RawTherapee. We demonstrate the utility of the GI in addressing common issues encountered in assessing plant biology experiments, underscoring its potential as a reliable and accessible tool. Finally, we explore the correlation between GI and chlorophyll content, assess its reliance on different types of photography, and summarizes the key steps for its effective utilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant intracellular immune receptors, primarily nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), can detect virulence proteins (effectors) from pathogens and activate NLR-triggered immunity (NTI). Recently,  sensor NLRs have been reported to function with  helper NLRs to activate immune responses. We investigated the role of two helper NLRs, Nrc2 (NLR required for cell death 2) and Nrc3, on immunity in tomato to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) mediated by the sensor NLR Prf and the Pto kinase. Loss-of-function mutations in both Nrc2 and Nrc3 completely compromised Prf/Pto-mediated NTI to Pst containing the cognate effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. An nrc3 mutant showed intermediate susceptibility between wild-type tomato plants and a Prf mutant, while an nrc2 mutant developed only mild disease symptoms. These observations indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act additively to contribute to Prf/Pto-mediated immunity. We also examined at what point Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in the Prf/Pto-mediated immune response. In the nrc2/3 mutant, programmed cell death (PCD) normally induced by constitutively-active variants of AvrPtoB, Pto or Prf was abolished, but that induced by M3K or Mkk2 was not. PCD induced by a constitutively active variant of Nrc3 was also abolished in a Nicotiana benthamiana line with reduced expression of Prf. MAPK activation triggered by expression of AvrPto in the wild-type Pto-expressing tomato plants was completely abolished in the nrc2/3 mutant. These results indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in concert with Prf/Pto and upstream of MAPK signaling. Nrc2 and Nrc3 were not required for the HR triggered by Ptr1, another sensor NLR mediating Pst resistance, although these helper NLRs do appear to be involved in resistance to certain Pst race 1 strains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pressurized cells with strong walls make up the hydrostatic skeleton of plants. Assembly and expansion of such stressed walls depend on a family of secreted RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides which, curiously, bind both a membrane receptor complex and wall-localized LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSINs (LRXs) in a mutually exclusive way. Here we show that, in root hairs, the RALF22 peptide has a dual structural and signaling role in cell expansion. Together with LRX1, it directs the compaction of charged pectin polymers at the root hair tip into periodic circumferential rings. Free RALF22 induces the formation of a complex with LORELEI-LIKE-GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) and FERONIA (FER), triggering adaptive cellular responses. These findings show how a peptide simultaneously functions as a structural component organizing cell wall architecture and as a signaling molecule that regulates this process. This mechanism may also underlie wall assembly and expansion in other plant cell types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many animal and plant pathogenic bacteria utilize a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the host cell1,2. Elucidation of how these effector proteins function in the host cell is critical for understanding infectious diseases in animals and plants3-5. The widely conserved AvrE/DspE-family effectors play a central role in the pathogenesis of diverse phytopathogenic bacteria6. These conserved effectors are involved in the induction of &#34;water-soaking&#34; and host cell death that are conducive to bacterial multiplication in infected tissues. However, the exact biochemical functions of AvrE/DspE-family effectors have been recalcitrant to mechanistic understanding for three decades. Here we show that AvrE/DspE-family effectors fold into a {beta}-barrel structure that resembles bacterial porins. Expression of AvrE and DspE in Xenopus oocytes results in (i) inward and outward currents, (ii) permeability to water and (iii) osmolarity-dependent oocyte swelling and bursting. Liposome reconstitution confirmed that the DspE channel alone is sufficient to allow the passage of small molecules such as fluorescein dye. Targeted screening of chemical blockers based on the predicted pore size (15-20 [A]) of the DspE channel identified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as inhibitors of the DspE/AvrE channels. Remarkably, PAMAMs broadly inhibit AvrE/DspE virulence activities in Xenopus oocytes and during Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae infections. Thus, we have unraveled the enigmatic function of a centrally important family of bacterial effectors with significant conceptual and practical implications in the study of bacterial pathogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although angiosperm plants have a general capacity to react after the immunity elicitor chitin or chitosan treatment by the cell wall callose deposition, this response in particular cell types and its evolutionary conservation is not understood. Here we show that also the growing root hairs (RHs) of Arabidopsis can respond to a mild (0.001%) chitosan treatment by the callose deposition and by a deceleration of the RH growth. We demonstrate that the glucan synthase-like 5 (GSL5)/PMR4 is vital for chitosan-induced callose deposition but not for RH growth inhibition. Upon the higher chitosan concentration (0.01%) treatment, RHs do not deposit callose, while growth inhibition is prominent. To understand the specificities of the low and high concentration chitosan treatments, we analysed the corresponding PTI signalling components, gene expression, and RH cellular endomembrane and cytoskeleton modifications. Importantly, chitosan-induced callose deposition is also present in the functionally analogous and evolutionarily only distantly related RH-like structures rhizophores (lycophytes) and rhizoids (bryophytes). Our results point to the RH callose deposition as a conserved strategy of soil-anchoring plant cells (rhizoids/rhizophores/RHs) to deal with mild biotic stress. At the same time, high chitosan concentration prominently disturbs intracellular dynamics, tip-localised endomembrane compartments and RH growth, precluding callose deposition.</p>
