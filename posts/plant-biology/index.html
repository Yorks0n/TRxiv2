This ~450 million years old symbiosis was key in driving land colonisation by plants. In angiosperms, AM is thought to be initiated via the perception by the host plant of AM-fungi derived chito- and lipochito-oligosaccharides leading to the activation of a conserved signalling pathway referred to as the Common Symbiosis Pathway. Genetics in legumes and monocots have demonstrated that members of the Lysin motif Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) family are important for the perception of these AM-fungi derived molecules, although none of the LysM-RLK mutants or combination of mutants described to date fully abolish AM. This discrepancy with the phenotypes observed for components of the CSP, which fail to host AM fungi, might be the result of genetic redundancy between the multiple LysM-RLK paralogs found in these species. In contrast to angiosperms, the liverwort Marchantia paleacea contains only four LysM-RLKs. In this study, we demonstrate the essential role of one LysM-RLK for AM in M. paleacea. Furthermore, we present evidence that Marchantia's ability to respond to chito- or lipochito-oligosaccharides is not a predictor of its symbiotic ability, suggesting the existence of yet uncharacterized AM-fungi signals.\nAn oomycete effector co-opts a host RabGAP protein to remodel pathogen interface and subvert defense-related secretion\nAuthors: Yuen, E. L. H.; Tumtas, Y.; Chan, L. I.; Ibrahim, T.; Evangelisti, E.; Tulin, F.; Sklenar, J.; Menke, F.; Kamoun, S.; Bubeck, D.; Schornack, S.; Bozkurt, T. O.\nScore: 28.3, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575225\nPathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate host cell membrane dynamics, a crucial adaptation to survive in hostile environments shaped by innate immune responses. Plant- derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TBC1D15L, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TBC1D15L as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a--a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TBC1D15L, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co- opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens.\nConservation of symbiotic signalling across 450 million years of plant evolution\nAuthors: Vernie, T.; Rich, M.

The fossil record2 and genetic evidence in extant species3 suggest that this transition was facilitated by interactions with symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi4. This ancestral symbiosis relied on the biosynthesis of chemicals by the host plant, both as signals5 and as nutrients3. In angiosperms, a signalling pathway involving the receptor-like kinase SYMRK/DMI26,7, the Calcium and Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CCaMK/DMI38 and the transcription factor CYCLOPS/IPD39,10 has been described as the common symbiosis pathway (CSP), essential for the establishment of the AM symbiosis and the root-nodule symbiosis11. Phylogenetic and comparative phylogenomic analyses indicated an ancient origin of the CSP, present in all extant land plants forming intracellular symbioses12-15. Trans-complementation assays of the angiosperm mutants with orthologs from diverse species further indicated the conservation of the molecular function of the CSP across the embryophytes9,12,14-16. However, this correlative evidence did not allow testing the ancestral biological function of the CSP. In this study we demonstrate that SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS are essential for the colonization by AM fungi in bryophytes, indicating that plants have maintained a dedicated signalling pathway to support symbiotic interactions for 450 million years.\nChromosome-scale genome assembly of bread wheat's wild relative Triticum timopheevii\nAuthors: Grewal, S.; Yang, C.; Scholefield, D.; Ashling, S.; Ghosh, S.; Swarbreck, D.; Collins, J.; Yao, E.; Sen, T. Z.; Wilson, M.; Yant, L.; King, I. P.; King, J.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575864\nWheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important food crops with an urgent need for increase in its production to feed the growing world. Triticum timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28) is an allotetraploid wheat wild relative species containing the At and G genomes that has been exploited in many pre-breeding programmes for wheat improvement. In this study, we report the generation of a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of T. timopheevii accession PI 94760 based on PacBio HiFi reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). The assembly comprised a total size of 9.35 Gb, featuring a contig N50 of 42.4 Mb, and 166,325 predicted gene models. DNA methylation analysis showed that the G genome had on average more methylated bases than the At genome. The G genome was also more closely related to the S genome of Aegilops speltoides than to the B genome of hexaploid or tetraploid wheat. In summary, the T. timopheevii genome assembly provides a valuable resource for genome-informed discovery of agronomically important genes for food security.\nPolarised subcellular activation of ROPs by specific ROPGEFs drives pollen germination in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Bouatta, A. M.; Lepper, A.; Denninger, P.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575165\nDuring plant fertilisation, excess male gametes compete for a limited number of female gametes. The dormant male gametophyte, encapsulated in the pollen grain, consists of two sperm cells enclosed in a vegetative cell. After reaching the stigma of a compatible flower, quick and efficient germination of the vegetative cell to a tip-growing pollen tube is crucial to ensure fertilisation success. RHO OF PLANTS (ROP) signalling and their activating ROP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS (ROPGEFs) are essential for initiating polar growth processes in multiple cell types. However, which ROPGEFs activate pollen germination is unknown. We investigated the role of ROPGEFs in initiating pollen germination and the required cell polarity establishment. Of the five pollen-expressed ROPGEFs, we found that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF12 are required for pollen germination and male fertilisation success, as gef8;gef9;gef12 triple mutants showed almost complete loss of pollen germination in vitro and had a reduced allele transmission rate. Live cell imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of subcellular protein distribution showed that GEF8 and GEF9, but not GEF12, displayed transient polar protein accumulations at the future site of pollen germination minutes before pollen germination, demonstrating specific roles for GEF8 and GEF9 during the initiation of pollen germination. Furthermore, this novel GEF accumulation appears in a biphasic temporal manner and can shift its location. We showed that the C-terminal domain of GEF8 and GEF9 confers this protein accumulation and demonstrated that GEFs locally activate ROPs and alter Ca2+ signalling, which is required for pollen tube germination. We demonstrated that GEFs do not act redundantly during pollen germination and described for the first time a polar domain with spatiotemporal flexibility, which is crucial for the de novo establishment of a polar growth domain within a cell and, thus, for pollen function and fertilisation success.\nGenomes of Aegilops umbellulata provide new insights into unique structural variations and genetic diversity in the U-genome for wheat improvement\nAuthors: Singh, J.; Gudi, S.; Maughan, P. J.; Liu, Z.; Kolmer, J.; Wang, M.; Chen, X.; Rouse, M.; Lasserre-Zuber, P.; Rimbert, H.; Sehgal, S.; Fiedler, J.; Choulet, F.; Acevado, M.; Gupta, R.; Gill, U.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575480\nAegilops spp. serve as an important reservoir for novel sources of resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. To harness this reservoir, we have generated a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of an Ae. umbellulata accession PI 554389 using a combination of PacBio HiFi, Oxford nanopore, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing technologies and resequenced 20 Ae. umbellulata genomes using Illumina sequencing. We assembled a 4.20 Gb genome spanned over seven chromosomes, rich in repetitive elements ([~]84%), achieving a QV of 59.54 with 98.14% completeness. The phylogenetic analysis places the U-genome with D-lineage, but major and distinct rearrangements were revealed in the U-genome. Unique transposon landscape of diploid U-genome and complex chromosomal rearrangements, most prominently in 4U and 6U chromosomes uncovered a distinct evolutionary trajectory of Ae. umbellulata. Additionally, the resequencing of geographically and morphologically diverse Ae. umbellulata accessions revealed three distinctive evolutionary sub-populations. Resequencing also identified six new haplotypes for Lr9, the first leaf rust resistance gene introgressed and cloned from Ae. umbellulata. These genomics resources along with high levels of resistance in the resequenced accessions against five devastating wheat diseases affirmed the genetic potential of Ae. umbellulata for wheat improvement.\nStrategy for unlimited cycles of scarless oligonucleotide directed gene editing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\nAuthors: Ross, I. L.; Budiman, S.; Le, H. P.; Xiong, D.; Hemker, F.; Millen, E. A.; Oey, M.; Hankamer, B.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576255\nCRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii relies on the use of selective marker genes to enrich for non-selectable target mutations. This becomes challenging when many sequential modifications are required in a single cell line, as useful markers are limited. Here we demonstrate a cyclical selection process which only requires a single marker gene to identify an almost infinite sequential series of CRISPR-based target gene modifications. The NIA1 (Nit1, NR; nitrate reductase) gene was this selectable marker. In the forward stage of the cycle, a stop codon was engineered into the NIA1 gene at the CRISPR target location. Cells retaining the wild type NIA1 gene were killed by chlorate, while NIA1 knockout mutants survived. In the reverse phase of the cycle, the stop codon engineered into the NIA1 gene during the forward phase was edited back to the wild type sequence. Using nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, here only the reverted wild type cells survived. By using CRISPR to specifically deactivate and reactivate the NIA1 gene, a marker system was established that flipped back and forth between chlorate- and auxotrophic (nitrate) based selection. This provided a scarless cyclical marker system that enabled an indefinite series of CRISPR edits in other, non-selectable genes. Here, we demonstrate that this 'Sequential CRISPR via Recycling Endogenous Auxotrophic Markers (SCREAM)' technology enables an essentially limitless series of genetic modifications to be introduced to a single cell lineage of C. reinhardtii in a fast and efficient manner to complete complex genetic engineering.\nCEP signaling coordinates plant immunity with nitrogen status\nAuthors: Rzemieniewski, J.; Leicher, H.; Lee, H. K.; Broyart, C.; Nayem, S.; Wiese, C.; Maroschek, J.; Camgoez, Z.; Olsson Lalun, V.; Djordjevic, M. A.; Vlot, A.

Here, we identified C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs (CEPs) as novel immune-modulatory peptides (phytocytokines) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data reveals that CEPs induce immune outputs and are required to mount resistance against the leaf-infecting bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We show that effective immunity requires CEP perception by tissue-specific CEP RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) and CEPR2. Moreover, we identified the related RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) as a novel CEP4-specific CEP receptor contributing to CEP-mediated immunity, suggesting a complex interplay of multiple CEP ligands and receptors in different tissues during biotic stress. CEPs have a known role in the regulation of root growth and systemic nitrogen (N)-demand signaling. We now provide evidence that CEPs and their receptors promote immunity in an N status-dependent manner, suggesting a previously unknown molecular crosstalk between plant nutrition and cell surface immunity. We propose that CEPs and their receptors are central regulators for the adaptation of biotic stress responses to plant-available resources.\nA dynamic WUSCHEL / Layer 1 interplay directs shoot apical meristem formation during regeneration\nAuthors: Kumar, M.; Ayzenshtat, D.; Zemach, H.; Belausov, E.; Eshed-Williams, L.; Bocobza, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575947\nDe novo shoot apical meristem (SAM) organogenesis during regeneration in tissue culture has been investigated for several decades, but the precise mechanisms governing early-stage cell fate specification remain elusive. In contrast to SAM establishment during embryogenesis, in vitro SAM formation occurs without positional cues, and is characterized by spontaneous cellular patterning. Here, we have elucidated the initial stages of SAM organogenesis and the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate gene patterning to establish SAM homeostasis. We found that SAM organogenesis in tobacco calli initiates with protuberance formation followed by the formation of an intact L1 layer covering the nascent protuberance. Acquisition of L1 cellular identity is indispensable for de novo SAM formation, which also requires WUSCHEL (WUS) and the cellular capacity to direct anticlinal cell divisions. An intriguing finding is that TONNEAU1 silencing prevents the exclusive occurrence of anticlinal divisions in the outermost layer of the protuberances and suppresses the acquisition of L1 cellular identity, ultimately impeding regeneration. This study exposes an intricate interplay between L1 and WUS expression and that any disruption in this interplay compromises shoot formation. It further provides a novel molecular framework for the characterization of WUS/L1 interplay-mediated shoot apical meristem formation during regeneration.\nAnnexin and calcium-regulated priming of legume root cells for endosymbiotic infection\nAuthors: Guillory, A.; Fournier, J.; Kelner, A.; Hobecker, K.; Auriac, M.-C.; Frances, L.; Delers, A.; Le Ru, A.; Keller, J.; Delaux, P.-M.; Gutjahr, C.; Frei Dit Frey, N.; de Carvalho-Niebel, F.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574854\nLegumes establish endosymbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or rhizobia bacteria to improve mineral nutrition. Symbionts are then hosted in privileged habitats, root cortex (for AM fungi) or nodules (for rhizobia), for efficient nutrient exchanges. To reach them, the plant creates trans-vacuolar cytoplasmic bridges, key for predicting and directing AM fungi hyphae or rhizobia-filled infection threads (ITs) entry. Yet, mechanisms underlying this pre-infection cellular remodelling are poorly studied. Here we show that unique ultrastructural changes and Ca2+ spiking signals closely linked to MtAnn1 annexin cellular dynamics, shape rhizobia-primed cells. Loss of MtAnn1 function in M. truncatula affects peak amplitude, cytoplasm configuration and rhizobia infection, consistent with MtAnn1s role in regulating this priming state. MtAnn1, mainly recruited during evolution in plants establishing endosymbioses, also appears involved in the ancient AM symbiosis in M. truncatula. Together, our work suggests MtAnn1 as part of an ancient Ca2+-regulatory module for transcellular endosymbiotic root infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">To ensure their water and mineral nutrition, most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with soil-borne Glomeromycota fungi. This ~450 million years old symbiosis was key in driving land colonisation by plants. In angiosperms, AM is thought to be initiated via the perception by the host plant of AM-fungi derived chito- and lipochito-oligosaccharides leading to the activation of a conserved signalling pathway referred to as the Common Symbiosis Pathway. Genetics in legumes and monocots have demonstrated that members of the Lysin motif Receptor-Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) family are important for the perception of these AM-fungi derived molecules, although none of the LysM-RLK mutants or combination of mutants described to date fully abolish AM. This discrepancy with the phenotypes observed for components of the CSP, which fail to host AM fungi, might be the result of genetic redundancy between the multiple LysM-RLK paralogs found in these species. In contrast to angiosperms, the liverwort Marchantia paleacea contains only four LysM-RLKs. In this study, we demonstrate the essential role of one LysM-RLK for AM in M. paleacea. Furthermore, we present evidence that Marchantia&#39;s ability to respond to chito- or lipochito-oligosaccharides is not a predictor of its symbiotic ability, suggesting the existence of yet uncharacterized AM-fungi signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate host cell membrane dynamics, a crucial adaptation to survive in hostile environments shaped by innate immune responses. Plant- derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TBC1D15L, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TBC1D15L as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a--a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TBC1D15L, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co- opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens.</p>

The colonization of land by plants 450 million years ago revolutionized life on Earth1. The fossil record2 and genetic evidence in extant species3 suggest that this transition was facilitated by interactions with symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi4. This ancestral symbiosis relied on the biosynthesis of chemicals by the host plant, both as signals5 and as nutrients3. In angiosperms, a signalling pathway involving the receptor-like kinase SYMRK/DMI26,7, the Calcium and Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CCaMK/DMI38 and the transcription factor CYCLOPS/IPD39,10 has been described as the common symbiosis pathway (CSP), essential for the establishment of the AM symbiosis and the root-nodule symbiosis11. Phylogenetic and comparative phylogenomic analyses indicated an ancient origin of the CSP, present in all extant land plants forming intracellular symbioses12-15. Trans-complementation assays of the angiosperm mutants with orthologs from diverse species further indicated the conservation of the molecular function of the CSP across the embryophytes9,12,14-16. However, this correlative evidence did not allow testing the ancestral biological function of the CSP. In this study we demonstrate that SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS are essential for the colonization by AM fungi in bryophytes, indicating that plants have maintained a dedicated signalling pathway to support symbiotic interactions for 450 million years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important food crops with an urgent need for increase in its production to feed the growing world. Triticum timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28) is an allotetraploid wheat wild relative species containing the At and G genomes that has been exploited in many pre-breeding programmes for wheat improvement. In this study, we report the generation of a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of T. timopheevii accession PI 94760 based on PacBio HiFi reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). The assembly comprised a total size of 9.35 Gb, featuring a contig N50 of 42.4 Mb, and 166,325 predicted gene models. DNA methylation analysis showed that the G genome had on average more methylated bases than the At genome. The G genome was also more closely related to the S genome of Aegilops speltoides than to the B genome of hexaploid or tetraploid wheat. In summary, the T. timopheevii genome assembly provides a valuable resource for genome-informed discovery of agronomically important genes for food security.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During plant fertilisation, excess male gametes compete for a limited number of female gametes. The dormant male gametophyte, encapsulated in the pollen grain, consists of two sperm cells enclosed in a vegetative cell. After reaching the stigma of a compatible flower, quick and efficient germination of the vegetative cell to a tip-growing pollen tube is crucial to ensure fertilisation success. RHO OF PLANTS (ROP) signalling and their activating ROP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS (ROPGEFs) are essential for initiating polar growth processes in multiple cell types. However, which ROPGEFs activate pollen germination is unknown. We investigated the role of ROPGEFs in initiating pollen germination and the required cell polarity establishment. Of the five pollen-expressed ROPGEFs, we found that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF12 are required for pollen germination and male fertilisation success, as gef8;gef9;gef12 triple mutants showed almost complete loss of pollen germination in vitro and had a reduced allele transmission rate. Live cell imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of subcellular protein distribution showed that GEF8 and GEF9, but not GEF12, displayed transient polar protein accumulations at the future site of pollen germination minutes before pollen germination, demonstrating specific roles for GEF8 and GEF9 during the initiation of pollen germination. Furthermore, this novel GEF accumulation appears in a biphasic temporal manner and can shift its location. We showed that the C-terminal domain of GEF8 and GEF9 confers this protein accumulation and demonstrated that GEFs locally activate ROPs and alter Ca2&#43; signalling, which is required for pollen tube germination. We demonstrated that GEFs do not act redundantly during pollen germination and described for the first time a polar domain with spatiotemporal flexibility, which is crucial for the de novo establishment of a polar growth domain within a cell and, thus, for pollen function and fertilisation success.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aegilops spp. serve as an important reservoir for novel sources of resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. To harness this reservoir, we have generated a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of an Ae. umbellulata accession PI 554389 using a combination of PacBio HiFi, Oxford nanopore, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing technologies and resequenced 20 Ae. umbellulata genomes using Illumina sequencing. We assembled a 4.20 Gb genome spanned over seven chromosomes, rich in repetitive elements ([~]84%), achieving a QV of 59.54 with 98.14% completeness. The phylogenetic analysis places the U-genome with D-lineage, but major and distinct rearrangements were revealed in the U-genome. Unique transposon landscape of diploid U-genome and complex chromosomal rearrangements, most prominently in 4U and 6U chromosomes uncovered a distinct evolutionary trajectory of Ae. umbellulata. Additionally, the resequencing of geographically and morphologically diverse Ae. umbellulata accessions revealed three distinctive evolutionary sub-populations. Resequencing also identified six new haplotypes for Lr9, the first leaf rust resistance gene introgressed and cloned from Ae. umbellulata. These genomics resources along with high levels of resistance in the resequenced accessions against five devastating wheat diseases affirmed the genetic potential of Ae. umbellulata for wheat improvement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii relies on the use of selective marker genes to enrich for non-selectable target mutations. This becomes challenging when many sequential modifications are required in a single cell line, as useful markers are limited. Here we demonstrate a cyclical selection process which only requires a single marker gene to identify an almost infinite sequential series of CRISPR-based target gene modifications. The NIA1 (Nit1, NR; nitrate reductase) gene was this selectable marker. In the forward stage of the cycle, a stop codon was engineered into the NIA1 gene at the CRISPR target location. Cells retaining the wild type NIA1 gene were killed by chlorate, while NIA1 knockout mutants survived. In the reverse phase of the cycle, the stop codon engineered into the NIA1 gene during the forward phase was edited back to the wild type sequence. Using nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, here only the reverted wild type cells survived. By using CRISPR to specifically deactivate and reactivate the NIA1 gene, a marker system was established that flipped back and forth between chlorate- and auxotrophic (nitrate) based selection. This provided a scarless cyclical marker system that enabled an indefinite series of CRISPR edits in other, non-selectable genes. Here, we demonstrate that this &#39;Sequential CRISPR via Recycling Endogenous Auxotrophic Markers (SCREAM)&#39; technology enables an essentially limitless series of genetic modifications to be introduced to a single cell lineage of C. reinhardtii in a fast and efficient manner to complete complex genetic engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant endogenous signaling peptides shape growth, development and adaptations to biotic and abiotic stress. Here, we identified C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs (CEPs) as novel immune-modulatory peptides (phytocytokines) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data reveals that CEPs induce immune outputs and are required to mount resistance against the leaf-infecting bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We show that effective immunity requires CEP perception by tissue-specific CEP RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) and CEPR2. Moreover, we identified the related RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) as a novel CEP4-specific CEP receptor contributing to CEP-mediated immunity, suggesting a complex interplay of multiple CEP ligands and receptors in different tissues during biotic stress. CEPs have a known role in the regulation of root growth and systemic nitrogen (N)-demand signaling. We now provide evidence that CEPs and their receptors promote immunity in an N status-dependent manner, suggesting a previously unknown molecular crosstalk between plant nutrition and cell surface immunity. We propose that CEPs and their receptors are central regulators for the adaptation of biotic stress responses to plant-available resources.</p>

        <p class="abstract">De novo shoot apical meristem (SAM) organogenesis during regeneration in tissue culture has been investigated for several decades, but the precise mechanisms governing early-stage cell fate specification remain elusive. In contrast to SAM establishment during embryogenesis, in vitro SAM formation occurs without positional cues, and is characterized by spontaneous cellular patterning. Here, we have elucidated the initial stages of SAM organogenesis and the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate gene patterning to establish SAM homeostasis. We found that SAM organogenesis in tobacco calli initiates with protuberance formation followed by the formation of an intact L1 layer covering the nascent protuberance. Acquisition of L1 cellular identity is indispensable for de novo SAM formation, which also requires WUSCHEL (WUS) and the cellular capacity to direct anticlinal cell divisions. An intriguing finding is that TONNEAU1 silencing prevents the exclusive occurrence of anticlinal divisions in the outermost layer of the protuberances and suppresses the acquisition of L1 cellular identity, ultimately impeding regeneration. This study exposes an intricate interplay between L1 and WUS expression and that any disruption in this interplay compromises shoot formation. It further provides a novel molecular framework for the characterization of WUS/L1 interplay-mediated shoot apical meristem formation during regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Legumes establish endosymbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or rhizobia bacteria to improve mineral nutrition. Symbionts are then hosted in privileged habitats, root cortex (for AM fungi) or nodules (for rhizobia), for efficient nutrient exchanges. To reach them, the plant creates trans-vacuolar cytoplasmic bridges, key for predicting and directing AM fungi hyphae or rhizobia-filled infection threads (ITs) entry. Yet, mechanisms underlying this pre-infection cellular remodelling are poorly studied. Here we show that unique ultrastructural changes and Ca2&#43; spiking signals closely linked to MtAnn1 annexin cellular dynamics, shape rhizobia-primed cells. Loss of MtAnn1 function in M. truncatula affects peak amplitude, cytoplasm configuration and rhizobia infection, consistent with MtAnn1s role in regulating this priming state. MtAnn1, mainly recruited during evolution in plants establishing endosymbioses, also appears involved in the ancient AM symbiosis in M. truncatula. Together, our work suggests MtAnn1 as part of an ancient Ca2&#43;-regulatory module for transcellular endosymbiotic root infection.</p>
