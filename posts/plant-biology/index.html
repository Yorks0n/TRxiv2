  "articleBody": " A conserved ESCRT-II-like protein participates in the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes\nAuthors: Yilmazer, I.; Vetrano, P.; Eicke, S.; Abt, M. R.; Traverso, E.; Morosinotto, T.; Zeeman, S. C.; Ramundo, S.; Sharma, M.\nScore: 28.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561251\nThylakoids are membrane-bound compartments located in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae. They play an indispensable role in the light-driven reactions that enable photosynthetic organisms to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugars. The biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes is a critical yet underappreciated area of research. One of the few known critical regulators of this process, VIPP1 (Vesicle-Inducing Protein in Plastids 1), was recently shown to be structurally similar to ESCRT-III proteins -- the first evidence for ESCRT-like (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) machinery in chloroplasts. Here, we used an affinity purification approach in two distantly related photosynthetic eukaryotes, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover proteins that interact with VIPP1. Among several newly identified proteins, we focused on a highly conserved but uncharacterized protein (VIPP1-Associated protein 1, VIA1) that robustly interacts with VIPP1 in both systems. VIA1 is predicted to contain a winged-helix domain, a characteristic feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins. The absence of VIA1 causes thylakoid swelling upon exposure to high light in Chlamydomonas and defective thylakoid biogenesis in the newly emerging leaf tissue in Arabidopsis, thereby delaying chloroplast development in this tissue. We propose that VIA1 is part of a previously unrecognized chloroplast ESCRT-like system that plays a critical role in forming, remodeling, and repairing photosynthetic membranes. Significance StatementThylakoid membranes are essential for photosynthesis, yet their biogenesis and maintenance are poorly understood. Of the few known proteins involved in these processes, VIPP1 stands out due to its similarity to ESCRT-III, an integral component of the ESCRT machinery that is responsible for membrane remodeling and trafficking in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. Here we report the discovery of VIA1, a conserved protein that interacts with VIPP1 and participates in thylakoid biogenesis and remodeling in two distantly related photosynthetic organisms. Because VIA1 contains a predicted winged-helix domain, a hallmark feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins, our data support the hypothesis that universal, mechanistic principles govern membrane remodeling across all living organisms.\nTransposon-triggered epigenetic chromatin dynamics modulate EFR-related pathogen response\nAuthors: Mencia, R.; Arce, A. L.; Houriet, C.; Xian, W.; Contreras, A.; Shirsekar, G.; Weigel, D.; Manavella, P. A.\nScore: 32.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561201\nInfectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive \"EFR-open\" chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.\nThe benzoxazinoid breakdown product 5-Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol has a dual function in maize defense against herbivory\nAuthors: Schimmel, B. C. J.; Escobar-Bravo, R.; Mateo, P.; Chen, C.; Glauser, G.; Ogi, V.; Wang, L.; Verdecia-Mogena, A.; Robert, C. A. M.; Erb, M.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561717\nCatabolism of plant secondary metabolites can yield bioactive breakdown products. However, these compounds often remain poorly characterized. Here, we report on the discovery, biosynthesis, and biological relevance of 5-Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol (5M2NP), a secondary metabolite breakdown product which accumulates in damaged maize tissues. We used mutant plants, biochemical complementation, and metabolomic analyses to determine the biosynthetic origin of 5M2NP. Additionally, we assessed 5M2NPs role in plant defense against herbivores. For this, we surveyed defense-associated responses (gene expression, phytohormones, volatile organic compounds) in wounded, 5M2NP-supplemented maize leaves, and performed bioassays with herbivorous insects. We found that 5M2NP accumulation upon tissue disruption is contingent upon a functional benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway. Labeling experiments demonstrated that 5M2NP is derived from DIMBOA. Physiological doses of exogenous 5M2NP increased the wound-induced expression of defense genes and emission of terpenoids. Additionally, 5M2NP exhibited antibiotic and antixenotic activities towards both generalist and specialist herbivores in nano-to micromolar quantities. We conclude that 5M2NP, which represents a novel class of plant-derived compounds, can act as a direct defense and a defense modulator. 5M2NP thus expands the functional repertoire of benzoxazinoids and likely contributes to their protective function against insect herbivores. The discovery of 5M2NP highlights the multifunctionality of plant secondary metabolites and their breakdown products.\nDevelopmentally regulated generation of a systemic signal for long-lasting defence priming in tomato\nAuthors: Stevens, K.; Roberts, M. R.; Jeynes-Cupper, K.; Catoni, M.; Luna, E.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561512\nTomato plants can be chemically primed to express long-lasting induced resistance (IR) for the protection of fruit against pathogen infection. Here, we determined that priming results in maintenance of IR in fruit and progeny of tomato plants only when initiated at an early developmental stage. Global DNA methylation analysis revealed seedling-specific changes, which occurred in the context of lower basal methylation, suggesting a greater epigenetic imprinting capacity of young plants. Remarkably, IR was found to be transmissible from primed rootstock to grafted unprimed scions. In these scions, we identified a subset of mobile 24 nt small RNAs associated with genes with enhanced expression in response to Botrytis cinerea infection in fruit, suggesting the functional association of a systemic signal with long-lasting IR and priming. Through integrated omics approaches we have identified markers of long-lasting priming in tomato fruit which could also serve as targets for durable resistance in other crops.\nRegulated Cleavage and Relocation of FERONIA Control Immunity in Arabidopsis Roots\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Qiang, X.; Liu, H.; Xu, F.; Wang, L.; Jiang, L.; Li, C.; Wang, B.; Luan, S.; Wu, D.; Zhou, F.; Yu, F.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562456\nPlant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity.\nArabidopsis AGO1 N-terminal Poly-Q domain promotes phase separation and association with stress granules during heat stress\nAuthors: Blagojevic, A.; Baldrich, P.; Schiaffini, M.; Lechner, E.; Baumberger, N.; Hammann, P.; Elmayan, T.; Garcia, D.; Vaucheret, H.; Meyers, B.; Genschik, P.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562039\nIn Arabidopsis thaliana, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) plays a central role in microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Nuclear AGO1 is loaded with miRNAs and exported to the cytosol where it associates to the rough ER to conduct miRNA-mediated translational repression, mRNA cleavage and biogenesis of phased siRNAs. These latter, as well as other cytosolic siRNAs, are loaded into cytosolic AGO1, but in which compartment this happens is not known. Moreover, the effect of stress on AGO1 localization is still unclear. Here, we show that a 37 degree Celsius heat stress (HS) promotes AGO1 protein accumulation in cytosolic condensates where it co-localizes with components of siRNA bodies and of stress granules (SGs). AGO1 contains a prion-like domain in its poorly characterized N-terminal Poly-Q domain, which, is sufficient to undergo phase separation, independent of the presence or absence of SGS3. HS only moderately affects the small RNA repertoire, the loading of AGO1 by miRNAs and the signatures of target cleavage, suggesting that its localization in condensates protects AGO1 rather than promotes or impairs its activity in reprograming gene expressing during stress. Collectively, our work shed new light on the impact of high temperature on a main effector of RNA silencing in plants.\nCompensation of compromised PRC2 regulation by a miRNA ensures robustness of Arabidopsis leaf development\nAuthors: Maugarny, A.; Vialette, A.; Adroher, B.; Mathy-Franchet, N.; Roudier, F.; Laufs, P.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561475\nRobustness is pervasive throughout biological systems, enabling them to maintain persistent outputs despite perturbations in their components. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism contributing to leaf morphology robustness in the face of genetic perturbations. In Arabidopsis, leaf shape is established during early development through the quantitative action of the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) gene that is negatively regulated by the co-expressed MICRORNA164A (MIR164A) gene. Compromised epigenetic regulation due to defective Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function results in the transcriptional derepression of CUC2 but has no impact on CUC2 protein dynamics or early morphogenesis. We solve this apparent paradox by showing that compromised PRC2 function simultaneously activates a compensatory mechanism involving another member of the MIR164 gene family, the MIR164B gene. This mechanism dampens CUC2 protein levels, thereby compensating for compromised PRC2 function and canalizing early leaf morphogenesis. Furthermore, we show that this compensation mechanism is active under different environmental conditions. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between different types of transcriptional regulation can contribute to developmental robustness.\nRapid propagation of Ca2+ waves and electrical signals in a liverwort Marchantia polymorpha\nAuthors: Watanabe, K.; Hashimoto, K.; Hasegawa, K.; Shindo, H.; Kupisz, K.; Koselski, M.; Wasko, P.; Trebacz, K.; Kuchitsu, K.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562169\nIn response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, vascular plants transmit long-distance Ca2+ and electrical signals from localized stress sites to distant tissues through their vasculature. Various models have been proposed for the mechanisms underlying the long-distance signaling, primarily centered around the presence of vascular bundles. We here demonstrate that the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possesses a mechanism for propagating Ca2+ waves and electrical signals in response to wounding. The propagation velocity of these signals was approximately 1-2 mm/s, equivalent to that observed in vascular plants. Both Ca2+ waves and electrical signals were inhibited by La3+ as well as tetraethylammonium chloride, suggesting crucial importance of both Ca2+ channel(s) and K+ channel(s) in wound-induced membrane depolarization as well as the subsequent long-distance signal propagation. Simultaneous recordings of Ca2+ and electrical signals indicated a tight coupling between the dynamics of these two signaling modalities. Furthermore, molecular genetic studies revealed that a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) channel plays a central role in the propagation of both Ca2+ waves and electrical signals. Conversely, none of the three two-pore channels (TPCs) were implicated in either signal propagation. These findings shed light on the evolutionary conservation of rapid long-distance Ca2+ wave and electrical signal propagation involving GLRs in land plants, even in the absence of vascular tissue.\nEvolution of research topics and paradigms in plant sciences\nAuthors: Shiu, S.-H.; Lehti-Shiu, M. D.\nScore: 77.1, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560457\nScientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields. Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.\nMultiomics-assisted characterization of rice-Yellow Stem Borer interaction provides genomic and mechanistic insights into stem borer tolerance in rice\nAuthors: CG, G.; Bangale, U.; Balija, V.; Ballichatla, S.; Potupureddi, G.; Varma, P.; Magar, N.; J, K.; M, S.; A.P., P.; Laha, G. S.; LV, S. R.; Barbadikar, K. M.; Raman, M. S.; Patel, H. K.; Maganti, S. M.; Sonti, R. V.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561791\nYellow stem borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major pest of rice in India, that can lead to 20-60% loss in rice production. Effective management of YSB infestation is challenged by the non-availability of adequate source of resistance and poor understanding of resistance mechanisms, thus necessitating studies for generating resources to breed YSB resistant rice and to understand rice-YSB interaction. In this study, by using bulk-segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) intervals in five rice chromosomes were mapped that could be associated with YSB tolerance at vegetative phase in a highly tolerant rice line named SM92. Further, multiple SNP markers that showed significant association with YSB tolerance in rice chromosomes 1, 5, 10, and 12 were developed. RNA-sequencing of the susceptible and tolerant lines revealed multiple genes present in the candidate QTL intervals to be differentially regulated upon YSB infestation. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a putative candidate gene that was predicted to encode an alpha-amylase inhibitor. Analysis of the transcriptome and metabolite profiles further revealed a possible link between phenylpropanoid metabolism and YSB tolerance. Taken together, our study provides insights on rice-YSB interaction at genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level, thereby facilitating the understanding of tolerance mechanism. Importantly, a promising breeding line and markers for YSB tolerance have been developed that can potentially aid in marker-assisted breeding of YSB resistance among elite rice cultivars. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlobal rice production is threatened by various pests, among which stem borers pose serious challenges. Hence, understanding the molecular intricacies of rice-stem borer interaction is necessary for effective pest management. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to unravel the mechanisms that might help rice combat yellow stem borer infestation, thus providing insights and scope for developing YSB tolerant rice varieties. To facilitate the latter, we developed markers that co-segregate with tolerance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Thylakoids are membrane-bound compartments located in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae. They play an indispensable role in the light-driven reactions that enable photosynthetic organisms to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugars. The biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes is a critical yet underappreciated area of research. One of the few known critical regulators of this process, VIPP1 (Vesicle-Inducing Protein in Plastids 1), was recently shown to be structurally similar to ESCRT-III proteins -- the first evidence for ESCRT-like (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) machinery in chloroplasts. Here, we used an affinity purification approach in two distantly related photosynthetic eukaryotes, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover proteins that interact with VIPP1. Among several newly identified proteins, we focused on a highly conserved but uncharacterized protein (VIPP1-Associated protein 1, VIA1) that robustly interacts with VIPP1 in both systems. VIA1 is predicted to contain a winged-helix domain, a characteristic feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins. The absence of VIA1 causes thylakoid swelling upon exposure to high light in Chlamydomonas and defective thylakoid biogenesis in the newly emerging leaf tissue in Arabidopsis, thereby delaying chloroplast development in this tissue. We propose that VIA1 is part of a previously unrecognized chloroplast ESCRT-like system that plays a critical role in forming, remodeling, and repairing photosynthetic membranes.

Significance StatementThylakoid membranes are essential for photosynthesis, yet their biogenesis and maintenance are poorly understood. Of the few known proteins involved in these processes, VIPP1 stands out due to its similarity to ESCRT-III, an integral component of the ESCRT machinery that is responsible for membrane remodeling and trafficking in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. Here we report the discovery of VIA1, a conserved protein that interacts with VIPP1 and participates in thylakoid biogenesis and remodeling in two distantly related photosynthetic organisms. Because VIA1 contains a predicted winged-helix domain, a hallmark feature of ESCRT-II proteins that mediates the interaction with ESCRT-III proteins, our data support the hypothesis that universal, mechanistic principles govern membrane remodeling across all living organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive &#34;EFR-open&#34; chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Catabolism of plant secondary metabolites can yield bioactive breakdown products. However, these compounds often remain poorly characterized. Here, we report on the discovery, biosynthesis, and biological relevance of 5-Methoxy-2-Nitrophenol (5M2NP), a secondary metabolite breakdown product which accumulates in damaged maize tissues. We used mutant plants, biochemical complementation, and metabolomic analyses to determine the biosynthetic origin of 5M2NP. Additionally, we assessed 5M2NPs role in plant defense against herbivores. For this, we surveyed defense-associated responses (gene expression, phytohormones, volatile organic compounds) in wounded, 5M2NP-supplemented maize leaves, and performed bioassays with herbivorous insects. We found that 5M2NP accumulation upon tissue disruption is contingent upon a functional benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway. Labeling experiments demonstrated that 5M2NP is derived from DIMBOA. Physiological doses of exogenous 5M2NP increased the wound-induced expression of defense genes and emission of terpenoids. Additionally, 5M2NP exhibited antibiotic and antixenotic activities towards both generalist and specialist herbivores in nano-to micromolar quantities. We conclude that 5M2NP, which represents a novel class of plant-derived compounds, can act as a direct defense and a defense modulator. 5M2NP thus expands the functional repertoire of benzoxazinoids and likely contributes to their protective function against insect herbivores. The discovery of 5M2NP highlights the multifunctionality of plant secondary metabolites and their breakdown products.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tomato plants can be chemically primed to express long-lasting induced resistance (IR) for the protection of fruit against pathogen infection. Here, we determined that priming results in maintenance of IR in fruit and progeny of tomato plants only when initiated at an early developmental stage. Global DNA methylation analysis revealed seedling-specific changes, which occurred in the context of lower basal methylation, suggesting a greater epigenetic imprinting capacity of young plants. Remarkably, IR was found to be transmissible from primed rootstock to grafted unprimed scions. In these scions, we identified a subset of mobile 24 nt small RNAs associated with genes with enhanced expression in response to Botrytis cinerea infection in fruit, suggesting the functional association of a systemic signal with long-lasting IR and priming. Through integrated omics approaches we have identified markers of long-lasting priming in tomato fruit which could also serve as targets for durable resistance in other crops.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant roots exhibit localized immunity (LI) specifically in the root cap and transition/elongation zone (TZ/EZ). Such immunity relies on receptor-like kinases localized at the plasma membrane (PM), which are essential for plant response to bacteria in the rhizosphere. Here, we identified a new mechanism of action for receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in LI. In the absence of bacterial stimuli, FER is localized to the PM, maintaining plant growth. When confronted with bacterial colonization, RALF23 peptide hyper-accumulates in TZ/EZ cells and activates a metalloproteinase that cleaves FER and transfer the cytosolic kinase domain into the nucleus. The nucleus-localized kinase domain of FER contributes to LI by reducing bacterial abundance at TZ/EZ. Thus, this work uncovered a unique mechanism by which a single receptor kinase acts in two molecular forms and two distinct subcellular locations to balance growth and immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) plays a central role in microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Nuclear AGO1 is loaded with miRNAs and exported to the cytosol where it associates to the rough ER to conduct miRNA-mediated translational repression, mRNA cleavage and biogenesis of phased siRNAs. These latter, as well as other cytosolic siRNAs, are loaded into cytosolic AGO1, but in which compartment this happens is not known. Moreover, the effect of stress on AGO1 localization is still unclear. Here, we show that a 37 degree Celsius heat stress (HS) promotes AGO1 protein accumulation in cytosolic condensates where it co-localizes with components of siRNA bodies and of stress granules (SGs). AGO1 contains a prion-like domain in its poorly characterized N-terminal Poly-Q domain, which, is sufficient to undergo phase separation, independent of the presence or absence of SGS3. HS only moderately affects the small RNA repertoire, the loading of AGO1 by miRNAs and the signatures of target cleavage, suggesting that its localization in condensates protects AGO1 rather than promotes or impairs its activity in reprograming gene expressing during stress. Collectively, our work shed new light on the impact of high temperature on a main effector of RNA silencing in plants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Robustness is pervasive throughout biological systems, enabling them to maintain persistent outputs despite perturbations in their components. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism contributing to leaf morphology robustness in the face of genetic perturbations. In Arabidopsis, leaf shape is established during early development through the quantitative action of the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) gene that is negatively regulated by the co-expressed MICRORNA164A (MIR164A) gene. Compromised epigenetic regulation due to defective Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function results in the transcriptional derepression of CUC2 but has no impact on CUC2 protein dynamics or early morphogenesis. We solve this apparent paradox by showing that compromised PRC2 function simultaneously activates a compensatory mechanism involving another member of the MIR164 gene family, the MIR164B gene. This mechanism dampens CUC2 protein levels, thereby compensating for compromised PRC2 function and canalizing early leaf morphogenesis. Furthermore, we show that this compensation mechanism is active under different environmental conditions. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between different types of transcriptional regulation can contribute to developmental robustness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In response to both biotic and abiotic stresses, vascular plants transmit long-distance Ca2&#43; and electrical signals from localized stress sites to distant tissues through their vasculature. Various models have been proposed for the mechanisms underlying the long-distance signaling, primarily centered around the presence of vascular bundles. We here demonstrate that the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possesses a mechanism for propagating Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals in response to wounding. The propagation velocity of these signals was approximately 1-2 mm/s, equivalent to that observed in vascular plants. Both Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals were inhibited by La3&#43; as well as tetraethylammonium chloride, suggesting crucial importance of both Ca2&#43; channel(s) and K&#43; channel(s) in wound-induced membrane depolarization as well as the subsequent long-distance signal propagation. Simultaneous recordings of Ca2&#43; and electrical signals indicated a tight coupling between the dynamics of these two signaling modalities. Furthermore, molecular genetic studies revealed that a GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) channel plays a central role in the propagation of both Ca2&#43; waves and electrical signals. Conversely, none of the three two-pore channels (TPCs) were implicated in either signal propagation. These findings shed light on the evolutionary conservation of rapid long-distance Ca2&#43; wave and electrical signal propagation involving GLRs in land plants, even in the absence of vascular tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Yellow stem borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major pest of rice in India, that can lead to 20-60% loss in rice production. Effective management of YSB infestation is challenged by the non-availability of adequate source of resistance and poor understanding of resistance mechanisms, thus necessitating studies for generating resources to breed YSB resistant rice and to understand rice-YSB interaction. In this study, by using bulk-segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) intervals in five rice chromosomes were mapped that could be associated with YSB tolerance at vegetative phase in a highly tolerant rice line named SM92. Further, multiple SNP markers that showed significant association with YSB tolerance in rice chromosomes 1, 5, 10, and 12 were developed. RNA-sequencing of the susceptible and tolerant lines revealed multiple genes present in the candidate QTL intervals to be differentially regulated upon YSB infestation. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a putative candidate gene that was predicted to encode an alpha-amylase inhibitor. Analysis of the transcriptome and metabolite profiles further revealed a possible link between phenylpropanoid metabolism and YSB tolerance. Taken together, our study provides insights on rice-YSB interaction at genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level, thereby facilitating the understanding of tolerance mechanism. Importantly, a promising breeding line and markers for YSB tolerance have been developed that can potentially aid in marker-assisted breeding of YSB resistance among elite rice cultivars.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlobal rice production is threatened by various pests, among which stem borers pose serious challenges. Hence, understanding the molecular intricacies of rice-stem borer interaction is necessary for effective pest management. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to unravel the mechanisms that might help rice combat yellow stem borer infestation, thus providing insights and scope for developing YSB tolerant rice varieties. To facilitate the latter, we developed markers that co-segregate with tolerance.</p>
