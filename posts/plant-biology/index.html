R.\nScore: 192.9, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.23.533992\nExtensive studies of the reference plant Arabidopsis have enabled a deep understanding of tissues throughout development, yet a census of cell types and states throughout development is lacking. Here, we present a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of seed-to-seed development employing over 800,000 nuclei, encompassing a diverse set of tissues across ten developmental stages, with spatial transcriptomic validation of the dynamic seed and silique. Cross-organ analyses revealed transcriptional conservation of cell types throughout development and heterogeneity within individual cell types influenced by organ-of-origin and developmental timing, including groups of transcription factors, suggesting gatekeeping by transcription factor activation. This atlas provides a resource for the study of cell type specification throughout the development continuum and a reference for stimulus-response and genetic perturbations at the single-cell resolution.\nUpstream regulator of genomic imprinting in rice endosperm is a small RNA-associated chromatin remodeler\nAuthors: Pal, A.; Sundar, V. H.; Nambiar, A.; Shivaprasad, P. V.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555833\nGenomic imprinting is observed in endosperm, a placenta-like seed tissue, where transposable elements (TEs) and repeat-derived small(s)RNAs mediate epigenetic changes in plants. In imprinting, uniparental gene expression arises due to parent-specific epigenetic marks on one allele but not on the other. The importance of sRNAs and their regulation in endosperm development or in imprinting is poorly understood in crops. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized CLASSY (CLSY)-family chromatin remodeler named OsCLSY3 is essential for rice endosperm development and imprinting, acting as an upstream player in sRNA pathway. Comparative transcriptome and genetic analysis indicated its endosperm-preferred expression and its paternally imprinted nature. These important features were modulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of tandemly arranged TEs in its promoter. Upon perturbation of OsCLSY3 in transgenic lines we observed defects in endosperm development and loss of around 70% of all sRNAs. Interestingly, well-conserved endosperm-specific sRNAs (siren) that are vital for reproductive fitness in angiosperms were dependent on OsCLSY3. We also observed many imprinted genes and seed development-associated genes under the control of CLSY3-dependent RdDM. These results support an essential role of OsCLSY3 in rice endosperm development and imprinting, and propose similar regulatory strategies involving CLSY3 homologs among other cereals. HighlightsO_LIUnlike among dicots, in rice and maize, CLSY3 is a maternally expressed imprinted gene majorly expressed in endosperm. C_LIO_LIEndosperm-preferred expression of OsCLSY3 is regulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation at two tandem transposon elements present in its promoter. C_LIO_LIOsCLSY3 is crucial for endosperm development and grain filling. It regulates expression of key seed development and endosperm-specific imprinted genes through RNA directed DNA methylation.

Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.\nComparative GWAS identifies a role for Mendel green pea gene in the nonphotochemical quenching kinetics of sorghum, maize, and arabidopsis\nAuthors: Sahay, S.; Shrestha, N.; Dias, H. M.; Mural, R. V.; Grzybowski, M.; Schnable, J. C.; Glowacka, K.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555201\nPhotosynthetic organisms must cope with rapid fluctuations in light intensity. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) enables the dissipation of excess light energy as heat under high light conditions, whereas its relaxation under low light maximizes photosynthetic productivity. We quantified variation in NPQ kinetics across a large sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) association panel in four environments, uncovering significant genetic control for NPQ. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 20 unique regions in the sorghum genome associated with NPQ. We detected strong signals from the sorghum ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) involved in plastid-nucleus signaling and tolerance to cold. By integrating GWAS results for NPQ across maize (Zea mays) and sorghum association panels, we identified a second gene, NON-YELLOWING 1 (NYE1), originally identified by Gregor Mendel in pea (Pisum sativum) and involved in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes, along with OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 37 (OEP37), that encodes a transporter in chloroplast envelope. Analysis of nye1 insertion alleles in A. thaliana confirmed the effect of this gene on NPQ kinetics across monocots and eudicots. We extended our comparative genomics GWAS framework across the entire maize and sorghum genomes, identifying four additional loci involved in NPQ kinetics. These results provide a baseline for engineering crops with improved NPQ kinetics and increasing the accuracy and speed of candidate gene identification for GWAS in species with high linkage disequilibrium.\nWater fluxes contribute to growth patterning in shoot meristems\nAuthors: Alonso-Serra, J.; Cheddadi, I.; Kiss, A.; Cerutti, G.; Lionnet, C.; Godin, C.; Hamant, O.\nScore: 30.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.554993\nIn multicellular organisms, localized tissue outgrowth creates a new water sink thereby modifying hydraulic patterns at the organ level. These fluxes are often considered passive by-products of development and their patterning and potential contribution to morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we generated a complete map of cell volumetric growth and deformation across the shoot apex in Arabidopsis thaliana. Within the organ-meristem boundary, we found that a subpopulation of cells next to fast-growing cells experiences volumetric shrinkage. To understand this process, we used a vertex-based model integrating mechanics and hydraulics, informed by the measured growth rates. Organ outgrowth simulations revealed the emerging water fluxes and predicted water deficit with volume loss for a few cells at the boundary. Consistently, in planta, a water-soluble dye is preferentially allocated to fast-growing tissues and fails to enter the boundary domain. Analysis of intact meristems further validated our model by revealing cell shrinkage next to fast-growing cells in different contexts of tissue surface curvature and cell deformation. A molecular signature of water deficit at the boundary further confirmed our conclusion. Taken together, we propose a model where the differential sink strength of emerging organs prescribes the hydraulic patterns that define the boundary domain at the shoot apex.\nInsights into Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions\nAuthors: Qi, M.; Yu, H.; Bredow, M.; Chicowski, A. S.; Fields, L. D.; Whitham, S. A.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555440\nThe multifaceted role of pathogen-encoded effectors in plant-pathogen interactions is complex and not fully understood. Effectors operate within intricate host environments, interacting with host proteins and other effectors to modulate virulence. The complex interplay between effectors raises the concept of metaeffectors, where some effectors regulate the activity of others. While previous research has demonstrated the importance of effector repertoires in pathogen virulence, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interactions between these effectors. This study explores the interactions among Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector candidates (PpECs). P. pachyrhizi haustorial transcriptome analysis identified a collection of predicted PpECs. Among these, PpEC23 was found to interact with PpEC48, prompting further exploration into their potential interaction with other effectors. Here, we utilized a yeast-two-hybrid screen to explore protein-protein interactions between PpECs. A split-luciferase complementation assay also demonstrated that these interactions could occur within soybean cells. Interestingly, PpEC48 displayed the ability to interact with several small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRP), suggesting its affinity for this specific class of effectors. We show that these interactions involve a histidine-rich domain within PpEC48, emphasizing the significance of structural motifs in mediating effector interactions. The unique nature of PpEC48, showing no sequence matches in other organisms, suggests its relatively recent evolution and potential orphan gene status. Our work reveals insights into the intricate network of interactions among P. pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions.\nHeterochromatin re-organization associated with the transcriptional reprogramming under viral infection in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Annacondia, M. L.; Juarez-Gonzalez, V. T.; Cheng, J.; Reig-Valiente, J. L.; Martinez, G.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555647\nEpigenetic mechanisms are key regulators of genomic integrity and genic expression. Emerging evidence shows that epigenetic regulation is an important component of the transcriptional reprogramming during stress. Despite this, the overall stress-induced reprogramming of the different epigenetic marks and their targets are unknown. Here, we uncovered multiple epigenetic changes taking place during viral infection in Arabidopsis thaliana and their connection with gene expression. We find that cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection induces an overall reorganization of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, which interact between them and are dynamic during infection. Overall, these epigenetic changes are involved in the reprogramming of the transcriptional program to adapt to the biotic stress, and might ensure genome stability through the transcriptional control of transposable elements (TEs). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) CURLY LEAF (CLF) mediates the transcriptional repression of genes gaining H3K27me3 during viral infection and that mutants on that component induce resistance against CMV. Altogether, our results provide a complete picture of the epigenetic changes that occur during biotic stress and exemplify the overall dynamism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic organisms.\nAn atypical endomembrane localized CNL-type immune receptor with a conserved deletion in the N-terminal signaling domain functions in cell death and immunity\nAuthors: Sunil, S.; Beeh, S.; Stoebbe, E.; Fischer, K. M.; Wilhelm, F.; Paris, C.; Meral, A.; Teasdale, L.; Jiang, Z.; Zhang, l.; Aguilar Parras, E.; Nuernberger, T.; Weigel, D.; Lozano-Duran, R.; El Kasmi, F.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556214\nPlants have evolved intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs) to induce a superior immune response. Upon activation, coiled-coil (CC) domain containing NLRs (CNLs) oligomerize to form apparent cation channels that promote calcium influx and cell death induction, with the alpha-1 helix of the individual CC domains penetrating membranes. Some members of a monophyletic subclass of CNLs, the ancient and autonomous NLRs (ANLs), are characterized by putative N-myristoylation and S-acylation sites at the N-terminus of their CCG10/GA domain, potentially mediating permanent membrane association. Whether these Potentially Membrane Localized NLRs (PMLs) mediate cell death upon activation in a similar way as reported for other CNLs has been unknown. We integrated phylogenetic, cell-biological, and functional studies to uncover the cell death function of an atypical but conserved Arabidopsis PML, PML5, which has a 113 amino acid deletion in its CCG10/GA domain. Active PML5 oligomers localize in Golgi membranes and the tonoplast, changes vacuolar morphology, and induce cell death, with the short N-terminus being sufficient for cell death. Mutant analysis supports a potential key role of PMLs in plant immunity. Similar deletions as in Arabidopsis PML5 are found in several Brassicales paralogs, pointing to the evolutionary importance of this innovation. PML5 is thus a naturally occurring CNL variant with a minimal signaling domain and its further study should help in understanding the functional importance of this minimal domain for NLR signaling.\nEstablishing a comprehensive web-based analysis platform for Nicotiana benthamiana genome and transcriptome\nAuthors: Kurotani, K.-i.; Hirakawa, H.; Shirasawa, K.; Tagiri, K.; Mori, M.; Ichihashi, Y.; Suzuki, T.; Tanizawa, Y.; Nakamura, Y.; Isobe, S.; Notaguchi, M.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556139\nNicotiana benthamiana has long served as a crucial plant material extensively used in plant physiology research, particularly in the field of plant pathology, because of its high susceptibility to plant viruses. Additionally, it serves as a production platform to test vaccines and other valuable substances. Among its approximately 3.1 Gb genome, 57,583 genes have been annotated within a 61 Mb region. We created a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to use transcriptomes for modern annotation. These tools allow to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads. To demonstrate their utility, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of enzymes within the nicotine biosynthesis pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Using the developed tool, expression profiles of the nicotine biosynthesis pathway genes were generated. The expression patterns of eight gene groups in the pathway were strongly expressed in the roots and weakly expressed in leaves and flowers of N. benthamiana. The results were consistent with the established gene expression profiles in Nicotiana tabacum and provided insights into gene family composition and expression trends. The compilation of this database tool can facilitate genetic analysis of N. benthamiana in the future.\nCell Fate Programming by Transcription Factors and Epigenetic Machinery in Stomatal Development\nAuthors: Liu, A.; Mair, A.; Matos, J.; Vollbrecht, M.; Xu, S.-L.; Bergmann, D.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554515\nThe development of multi-cellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding cis-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling - the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knock-down of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Extensive studies of the reference plant Arabidopsis have enabled a deep understanding of tissues throughout development, yet a census of cell types and states throughout development is lacking. Here, we present a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of seed-to-seed development employing over 800,000 nuclei, encompassing a diverse set of tissues across ten developmental stages, with spatial transcriptomic validation of the dynamic seed and silique. Cross-organ analyses revealed transcriptional conservation of cell types throughout development and heterogeneity within individual cell types influenced by organ-of-origin and developmental timing, including groups of transcription factors, suggesting gatekeeping by transcription factor activation. This atlas provides a resource for the study of cell type specification throughout the development continuum and a reference for stimulus-response and genetic perturbations at the single-cell resolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomic imprinting is observed in endosperm, a placenta-like seed tissue, where transposable elements (TEs) and repeat-derived small(s)RNAs mediate epigenetic changes in plants. In imprinting, uniparental gene expression arises due to parent-specific epigenetic marks on one allele but not on the other. The importance of sRNAs and their regulation in endosperm development or in imprinting is poorly understood in crops. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized CLASSY (CLSY)-family chromatin remodeler named OsCLSY3 is essential for rice endosperm development and imprinting, acting as an upstream player in sRNA pathway. Comparative transcriptome and genetic analysis indicated its endosperm-preferred expression and its paternally imprinted nature. These important features were modulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of tandemly arranged TEs in its promoter. Upon perturbation of OsCLSY3 in transgenic lines we observed defects in endosperm development and loss of around 70% of all sRNAs. Interestingly, well-conserved endosperm-specific sRNAs (siren) that are vital for reproductive fitness in angiosperms were dependent on OsCLSY3. We also observed many imprinted genes and seed development-associated genes under the control of CLSY3-dependent RdDM. These results support an essential role of OsCLSY3 in rice endosperm development and imprinting, and propose similar regulatory strategies involving CLSY3 homologs among other cereals.

        <p class="abstract">Root gravitropic bending represents a fundamental aspect of terrestrial plant physiology. Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Photosynthetic organisms must cope with rapid fluctuations in light intensity. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) enables the dissipation of excess light energy as heat under high light conditions, whereas its relaxation under low light maximizes photosynthetic productivity. We quantified variation in NPQ kinetics across a large sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) association panel in four environments, uncovering significant genetic control for NPQ. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 20 unique regions in the sorghum genome associated with NPQ. We detected strong signals from the sorghum ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) involved in plastid-nucleus signaling and tolerance to cold. By integrating GWAS results for NPQ across maize (Zea mays) and sorghum association panels, we identified a second gene, NON-YELLOWING 1 (NYE1), originally identified by Gregor Mendel in pea (Pisum sativum) and involved in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes, along with OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 37 (OEP37), that encodes a transporter in chloroplast envelope. Analysis of nye1 insertion alleles in A. thaliana confirmed the effect of this gene on NPQ kinetics across monocots and eudicots. We extended our comparative genomics GWAS framework across the entire maize and sorghum genomes, identifying four additional loci involved in NPQ kinetics. These results provide a baseline for engineering crops with improved NPQ kinetics and increasing the accuracy and speed of candidate gene identification for GWAS in species with high linkage disequilibrium.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In multicellular organisms, localized tissue outgrowth creates a new water sink thereby modifying hydraulic patterns at the organ level. These fluxes are often considered passive by-products of development and their patterning and potential contribution to morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we generated a complete map of cell volumetric growth and deformation across the shoot apex in Arabidopsis thaliana. Within the organ-meristem boundary, we found that a subpopulation of cells next to fast-growing cells experiences volumetric shrinkage. To understand this process, we used a vertex-based model integrating mechanics and hydraulics, informed by the measured growth rates. Organ outgrowth simulations revealed the emerging water fluxes and predicted water deficit with volume loss for a few cells at the boundary. Consistently, in planta, a water-soluble dye is preferentially allocated to fast-growing tissues and fails to enter the boundary domain. Analysis of intact meristems further validated our model by revealing cell shrinkage next to fast-growing cells in different contexts of tissue surface curvature and cell deformation. A molecular signature of water deficit at the boundary further confirmed our conclusion. Taken together, we propose a model where the differential sink strength of emerging organs prescribes the hydraulic patterns that define the boundary domain at the shoot apex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The multifaceted role of pathogen-encoded effectors in plant-pathogen interactions is complex and not fully understood. Effectors operate within intricate host environments, interacting with host proteins and other effectors to modulate virulence. The complex interplay between effectors raises the concept of metaeffectors, where some effectors regulate the activity of others. While previous research has demonstrated the importance of effector repertoires in pathogen virulence, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interactions between these effectors. This study explores the interactions among Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector candidates (PpECs). P. pachyrhizi haustorial transcriptome analysis identified a collection of predicted PpECs. Among these, PpEC23 was found to interact with PpEC48, prompting further exploration into their potential interaction with other effectors. Here, we utilized a yeast-two-hybrid screen to explore protein-protein interactions between PpECs. A split-luciferase complementation assay also demonstrated that these interactions could occur within soybean cells. Interestingly, PpEC48 displayed the ability to interact with several small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRP), suggesting its affinity for this specific class of effectors. We show that these interactions involve a histidine-rich domain within PpEC48, emphasizing the significance of structural motifs in mediating effector interactions. The unique nature of PpEC48, showing no sequence matches in other organisms, suggests its relatively recent evolution and potential orphan gene status. Our work reveals insights into the intricate network of interactions among P. pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epigenetic mechanisms are key regulators of genomic integrity and genic expression. Emerging evidence shows that epigenetic regulation is an important component of the transcriptional reprogramming during stress. Despite this, the overall stress-induced reprogramming of the different epigenetic marks and their targets are unknown. Here, we uncovered multiple epigenetic changes taking place during viral infection in Arabidopsis thaliana and their connection with gene expression. We find that cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection induces an overall reorganization of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, which interact between them and are dynamic during infection. Overall, these epigenetic changes are involved in the reprogramming of the transcriptional program to adapt to the biotic stress, and might ensure genome stability through the transcriptional control of transposable elements (TEs). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) CURLY LEAF (CLF) mediates the transcriptional repression of genes gaining H3K27me3 during viral infection and that mutants on that component induce resistance against CMV. Altogether, our results provide a complete picture of the epigenetic changes that occur during biotic stress and exemplify the overall dynamism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants have evolved intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs) to induce a superior immune response. Upon activation, coiled-coil (CC) domain containing NLRs (CNLs) oligomerize to form apparent cation channels that promote calcium influx and cell death induction, with the alpha-1 helix of the individual CC domains penetrating membranes. Some members of a monophyletic subclass of CNLs, the ancient and autonomous NLRs (ANLs), are characterized by putative N-myristoylation and S-acylation sites at the N-terminus of their CCG10/GA domain, potentially mediating permanent membrane association. Whether these Potentially Membrane Localized NLRs (PMLs) mediate cell death upon activation in a similar way as reported for other CNLs has been unknown. We integrated phylogenetic, cell-biological, and functional studies to uncover the cell death function of an atypical but conserved Arabidopsis PML, PML5, which has a 113 amino acid deletion in its CCG10/GA domain. Active PML5 oligomers localize in Golgi membranes and the tonoplast, changes vacuolar morphology, and induce cell death, with the short N-terminus being sufficient for cell death. Mutant analysis supports a potential key role of PMLs in plant immunity. Similar deletions as in Arabidopsis PML5 are found in several Brassicales paralogs, pointing to the evolutionary importance of this innovation. PML5 is thus a naturally occurring CNL variant with a minimal signaling domain and its further study should help in understanding the functional importance of this minimal domain for NLR signaling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nicotiana benthamiana has long served as a crucial plant material extensively used in plant physiology research, particularly in the field of plant pathology, because of its high susceptibility to plant viruses. Additionally, it serves as a production platform to test vaccines and other valuable substances. Among its approximately 3.1 Gb genome, 57,583 genes have been annotated within a 61 Mb region. We created a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to use transcriptomes for modern annotation. These tools allow to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads. To demonstrate their utility, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of enzymes within the nicotine biosynthesis pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Using the developed tool, expression profiles of the nicotine biosynthesis pathway genes were generated. The expression patterns of eight gene groups in the pathway were strongly expressed in the roots and weakly expressed in leaves and flowers of N. benthamiana. The results were consistent with the established gene expression profiles in Nicotiana tabacum and provided insights into gene family composition and expression trends. The compilation of this database tool can facilitate genetic analysis of N. benthamiana in the future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development of multi-cellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding cis-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling - the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knock-down of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.</p>
