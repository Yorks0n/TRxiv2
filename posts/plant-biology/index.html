A.; Chen, J.; Broderick, S.; Li, Z.; Aditya, S.; Tasneem, N.; Arndell, T.; Blundell, C.; Ericsson, D. J.; Figueroa, M.; Sperschneider, J.; Dodds, P.; Williams, S. J.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567997\nStem rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp.tritici (Pgt) is a major threat for wheat production and global food security. Central to the success of Pgt is the secretion of proteinaceous effectors that promote infection and colonisation, while immunity in wheat is driven by receptor-mediated recognition of these effectors resulting in pathogen avirulence. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich effector AvrSr27, the third experimentally derived structure of a Pgt effector. The AvrSr27 structure reveals a novel {beta}-strand rich modular fold consisting of two structurally similar domains and confirms the poor prediction we obtained from the AlphaFold2-derived model. The highly prevalent cysteine residues within the protein facilitate the co-ordination of 4 zinc molecules. Utilising the structure, we show that the N-terminal domain of AvrSr27 is sufficient for immune recognition and interaction by Sr27. The 7-cys motif sequence in each AvrSr27 domain, which facilitates zinc binding, was also found in two haustorially-expressed, structurally homologous Pgt proteins. Remarkably, despite relatively low sequence identity, we show that these proteins can associate with Sr27 and trigger cell death in heterologous systems and wheat protoplasts, albeit weaker than AvrSr27. Collectively, our findings have important implications for the field embarking on bespoke engineering of immunity receptors as solutions to plant disease.\nGuanylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptorsin rapid auxin responses\nAuthors: Qi, L.; Kwiatkowski, M.; Kulich, I.; Chen, H.; Gao, Y.; Yun, P.; Li, L.; Shabala, S.; Farmer, E.; Jaworski, K.; Friml, J.\nScore: 22.0, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567481\nThe major developmental signal in plants, auxin is perceived by TIR1/AFB receptors. It triggers transcriptional reprogramming via well-established canonical mechanism but also elusive rapid, non-transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that TIR1/AFB receptors have, next to recently identified adenylate cyclase, also guanylate cyclase activity. Auxin perception activates independently the cAMP and cGMP production by TIR1/AFBs in vitro and increases cAMP and cGMP levels in planta with a slow and fast dynamics, respectively. Exogenous cGMP but not cAMP application induces rapid cytosolic Ca2+ transients and root growth inhibition, suggesting that TIR1/AFB-derived cGMP mediates rapid auxin responses. This unprecedented combination of adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in a hormone receptor provides a new paradigm for how a single perception mechanism can mediate a multitude of diverse downstream responses. One-Sentence SummaryTIR1/AFB auxin receptors have guanylate cyclase activity, whose product, cGMP mediates rapid non-transcriptional auxin responses.\nComparative mutant analyses reveal a novel mechanism of ARF regulation in land plants\nAuthors: Prigge, M. J.; Morffy, N.; De Neve, A.; Szutu, W.; Juarez, M. J. A.; Johnson, K.; Do, N.; Lavy, M.; Hake, S.; Strader, L.; Estelle, M.; Richardson, A. E.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566459\nA major challenge in plant biology is to understand how the plant hormone auxin regulates diverse transcriptional responses throughout development, in different environments, and in different species. The answer may lie in the specific complement of auxin signaling components in each cell. The balance between activators (class-A AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS) and repressors (class-B ARFs) is particularly important. It is unclear how this balance is achieved. Through comparative analysis of novel, dominant mutants in maize and the moss Physcomitrium patens, we have discovered a [~]500-million-year-old mechanism of class-B ARF protein level regulation, important in determining cell fate decisions across land plants. Thus, our results add a key piece to the puzzle of how auxin regulates plant development.\nCrosstalk between salicylic acid signaling and the circadian clock promotes an effective immune response\nAuthors: Fraser, O. J. P.; Cargill, S. J.; Spoel, S. H.; van Ooijen, G.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568095\nThe rotation of Earth creates a cycle of day and night, leading to predictable changes in environmental conditions. The circadian clock synchronizes an organism with these environmental changes and alters their physiology in anticipation. Prediction of the probable timing of pathogen infection enables plants to prime their immune system without wasting resources or sacrificing growth. Here, we explore the relationship between the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA), and the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. We found that SA altered circadian rhythmicity through the SA receptor and master transcriptional coactivator, NPR1. Reciprocally, the circadian clock gates SA-induced expression of NPR1-dependent immune genes. Furthermore, the clock gene CCA1 is essential for SA-induced immunity to the major bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. These results reveal new interactions between the circadian clock and SA signaling which produce an effective immune response. Understanding how and why the immune response in plants is linked to the circadian clock is crucial in working towards improved crop productivity.\nCooperativity and additivity in plant enhancers\nAuthors: Jores, T.; Tonnies, J.; Mueth, N. A.; Romanowski, A.; Fields, S.; Cuperus, J.; Queitsch, C.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568158\nEnhancers are cis-regulatory elements that shape gene expression in response to numerous developmental and environmental cues. In animals, several models have been proposed to explain how enhancers integrate the activity of multiple transcription factors. However, it remains largely unknown how plant enhancers integrate transcription factor activity. Here, we use Plant STARR-seq to characterize three light-responsive plant enhancers--AB80, Cab-1, and rbcS-E9--derived from genes active in photosynthesis. Saturation mutagenesis reveals mutations, many of which cluster in short regions, that strongly reduce enhancer activity in the light, in the dark or in both conditions. When tested in the light, these mutation-sensitive regions do not function on their own; rather, cooperative interactions with other such regions are required for full activity. Epistatic interactions occur between mutations in adjacent mutation-sensitive regions, and the spacing and order of mutation-sensitive regions in synthetic enhancers affects enhancer activity. In contrast, when tested in the dark, mutation-sensitive regions act independently and additively in conferring enhancer activity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that plant enhancers show evidence for both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements. This knowledge can be harnessed to design strong, condition-specific synthetic enhancers.\nFast and efficient root phenotyping via pose estimation\nAuthors: Berrigan, E.

D.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567949\nImage segmentation is commonly used to estimate the location and shape of plants and their external structures. Segmentation masks are then used to localize landmarks of interest and compute other geometric features that correspond to the plants phenotype. Despite its prevalence, segmentation-based approaches are laborious (requiring extensive annotation to train), and error-prone (derived geometric features are sensitive to instance mask integrity). Here we present a segmentation-free approach which leverages deep learning-based landmark detection and grouping, also known as pose estimation. We use a tool originally developed for animal motion capture called SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses) to automate the detection of distinct morphological landmarks on plant roots. Using a gel cylinder imaging system across multiple species, we show that our approach can reliably and efficiently recover root system topology at high accuracy, few annotated samples, and faster speed than segmentation-based approaches. In order to make use of this landmark-based representation for root phenotyping, we developed a Python library (sleap-roots) for trait extraction directly comparable to existing segmentation-based analysis software. We show that landmark-derived root traits are highly accurate and can be used for common downstream tasks including genotype classification and unsupervised trait mapping. Altogether, this work establishes the validity and advantages of pose estimation-based plant phenotyping. To facilitate adoption of this easy-to-use tool and to encourage further development, we make sleap-roots, all training data, models, and trait extraction code available at: https://github.com/talmolab/sleap-roots and https://osf.io/k7j9g/.\nMechanisms of infection and response of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici during compatible, incompatible and non-host interactions\nAuthors: Gomez-Gutierrez, S. V.; Million, C. R.; Jaiswal, N.; Gribskov, M.; Helm, M.; Goodwin, S. B.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567875\nZymoseptoria tritici incites Septoria tritici blotch, a disease causing significant annual yield losses in wheat. To investigate infection phase-specific gene expression in the pathogen we analyzed gene expression during infection of susceptible (Taichung 29) and resistant (Veranopolis and Israel 493) wheat cultivars, plus the non-host species barley at 1, 3, 6, 10, 17 and 23 days post-inoculation (DPI). There were dramatic differences in pathogen gene expression at 10 DPI in the compatible compared to both incompatible interactions. The largest differences in pathogen gene expression occurred at 3 DPI in both compatible and incompatible interactions compared to the non-host interaction. Thirty-one putative effectors had early expression in the compatible interaction. Subsequent subcellular localization studies using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that most candidate effectors localized to the nucleus and cytosol, and two localized to mobile cytosolic bodies, suggesting involvement in intracellular signaling or host gene regulation. Mycgr3109710, which localized to cytosolic bodies, belongs to the non-plant PR-1-like protein family implicated in virulence in other pathogens. Comparison of pathogen gene expression in resistant and susceptible hosts, in which an initial colonization is established, versus in the non-host species, allowed us to identify genes involved in establishing infection. Comparison of the compatible and incompatible interactions identified pathogen genes involved in transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth at 10 DPI. In addition, we contribute to the understanding of candidate effectors that are activated early during infection and might be involved in the initial plant immunity suppression.\nConservation of heat stress acclimation by the inositol polyphosphate multikinase, IPMK responsible for 4/6-InsP7 production in land plants\nAuthors: Yadav, R.; Liu, G.; Rana, P.; Pullagurla, N. J.; Qiu, D.; Jessen, H. J.; Laha, D.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567642\nInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are soluble cellular messengers that integrate environmental cues to induce adaptive responses in eukaryotes. In plants, the biological functions of various PP-InsP species are poorly understood, largely due to the absence of canonical enzymes present in other eukaryotes. The recent identification of a new PP-InsP isomer with yet unknown enantiomeric identity, 4/6-InsP7 in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, further highlights the intricate PP-InsP signalling network employed by plants. The abundance of 4/6-InsP7 in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7 is the major PP-InsP species present across land plants. Our findings demonstrate that the Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homolog, AtIPK2 generates 4/6-InsP7 in vitro. Furthermore, the cellular level of 4/6-InsP7 is controlled by the two Arabidopsis IPMK isoforms, AtIPK2 and AtIPK2{beta}. Notably, the activity of these IPMK proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation in Arabidopsis. During heat stress, the expression of genes encoding various heat shock proteins controlled by the heat shock factors (HSFs) is affected in the AtIPK2-deficient plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of HSF is regulated by the AtIPK2 proteins. Our parallel investigations using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha suggest that the InsP6 kinase activity of IPMK and the role of IPMK in regulating the heat stress response are evolutionarily conserved. Collectively, our study indicates that IPMK has played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.\nGenome sequence and cell biological toolbox of the highly regenerative, coenocytic green feather alga Bryopsis\nAuthors: Ochiai, K. K.; Hanawa, D.; Ogawa, H. A.; Tanaka, H.; Uesaka, K.; Edzuka, T.; Shirae-Kurabayashi, M.; Toyoda, A.; Itoh, T.; Goshima, G.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568388\nGreen feather algae (Bryopsidales) undergo a unique life cycle in which a single cell repeatedly executes nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in the development of a thallus (\u003e 100 mm) with characteristic morphology called coenocyte. Bryopsis is a representative coenocytic alga that has exceptionally high regeneration ability: extruded cytoplasm aggregates rapidly in seawater, leading to the formation of protoplasts. However, the genetic basis of the unique cell biology of Bryopsis remains poorly understood. Here, we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the nuclear genome of Bryopsis sp. (90.7 Mbp, 27 contigs, N50 = 6.7 Mbp, 14,034 protein-coding genes). Comparative genomic analyses indicate that the genes encoding BPL-1/Bryohealin, the aggregation-promoting lectin, are heavily duplicated in Bryopsis, whereas homologous genes are absent in other Ulvophycean algae, suggesting the basis of regeneration capability of Bryopsis. Bryopsis sp. possesses \u003e30 kinesins but only a single myosin, which differs from other green algae that have multiple types of myosin genes. Consistent with this biased motor toolkit, we observed that the bidirectional motility of chloroplasts in the cytoplasm was dependent on microtubules but not actin in Bryopsis sp. Unexpectedly, most genes required for cytokinesis in plants are present in Bryopsis, including those in the SNARE or kinesin superfamily. Nevertheless, a kinesin crucial for cytokinesis initiation in plants (NACK/Kinesin-7II) is hardly expressed in the coenocytic part of the thallus, possibly underlying the lack of cytokinesis in this portion. The present genome sequence lays the foundation for experimental biology in coenocytic macroalgae.\nGenetic factors explaining anthocyanin pigmentation differences\nAuthors: Marin Recinos, M. F.; Pucker, B.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.543820\nBackgroundAnthocyanins represent one of the most abundant coloration factors found in plants. Biological functions of anthocyanins range from reproduction to protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. Owing to a clearly visible phenotype of mutants, the anthocyanin biosynthesis and its sophisticated regulation have been studied in numerous plant species. Genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes are regulated by a transcription factor complex comprising MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins. ResultsA systematic comparison of anthocyanin-pigmented vs. non-pigmented varieties across flowering plant species was performed. Literature was screened for cases in which genetic factors causing anthocyanin loss were reported. Additionally, transcriptomic data sets from previous studies were reanalyzed to determine the genes most likely to be responsible for color variation based on their expression pattern. The contribution of different structural and regulatory genes to the pigmentation differences was quantified. Gene expression differences concerning transcription factors are by far the most frequent explanation for pigmentation differences observed between two varieties of the same species. Among the transcription factors in the analyzed cases, MYB genes are substantially more likely to explain pigmentation differences than bHLH or WD40 genes. ConclusionsThese findings support previous assumptions about the plasticity of transcriptional regulation and its importance for the evolution of novel coloration phenotypes. Our findings underline the particular significance of MYBs and their apparent dominant role in the specificity of the MBW complex.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Stem rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp.tritici (Pgt) is a major threat for wheat production and global food security. Central to the success of Pgt is the secretion of proteinaceous effectors that promote infection and colonisation, while immunity in wheat is driven by receptor-mediated recognition of these effectors resulting in pathogen avirulence. Here, we report the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich effector AvrSr27, the third experimentally derived structure of a Pgt effector. The AvrSr27 structure reveals a novel {beta}-strand rich modular fold consisting of two structurally similar domains and confirms the poor prediction we obtained from the AlphaFold2-derived model. The highly prevalent cysteine residues within the protein facilitate the co-ordination of 4 zinc molecules. Utilising the structure, we show that the N-terminal domain of AvrSr27 is sufficient for immune recognition and interaction by Sr27. The 7-cys motif sequence in each AvrSr27 domain, which facilitates zinc binding, was also found in two haustorially-expressed, structurally homologous Pgt proteins. Remarkably, despite relatively low sequence identity, we show that these proteins can associate with Sr27 and trigger cell death in heterologous systems and wheat protoplasts, albeit weaker than AvrSr27. Collectively, our findings have important implications for the field embarking on bespoke engineering of immunity receptors as solutions to plant disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The major developmental signal in plants, auxin is perceived by TIR1/AFB receptors. It triggers transcriptional reprogramming via well-established canonical mechanism but also elusive rapid, non-transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that TIR1/AFB receptors have, next to recently identified adenylate cyclase, also guanylate cyclase activity. Auxin perception activates independently the cAMP and cGMP production by TIR1/AFBs in vitro and increases cAMP and cGMP levels in planta with a slow and fast dynamics, respectively. Exogenous cGMP but not cAMP application induces rapid cytosolic Ca2&#43; transients and root growth inhibition, suggesting that TIR1/AFB-derived cGMP mediates rapid auxin responses. This unprecedented combination of adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in a hormone receptor provides a new paradigm for how a single perception mechanism can mediate a multitude of diverse downstream responses.

One-Sentence SummaryTIR1/AFB auxin receptors have guanylate cyclase activity, whose product, cGMP mediates rapid non-transcriptional auxin responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A major challenge in plant biology is to understand how the plant hormone auxin regulates diverse transcriptional responses throughout development, in different environments, and in different species. The answer may lie in the specific complement of auxin signaling components in each cell. The balance between activators (class-A AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS) and repressors (class-B ARFs) is particularly important. It is unclear how this balance is achieved. Through comparative analysis of novel, dominant mutants in maize and the moss Physcomitrium patens, we have discovered a [~]500-million-year-old mechanism of class-B ARF protein level regulation, important in determining cell fate decisions across land plants. Thus, our results add a key piece to the puzzle of how auxin regulates plant development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rotation of Earth creates a cycle of day and night, leading to predictable changes in environmental conditions. The circadian clock synchronizes an organism with these environmental changes and alters their physiology in anticipation. Prediction of the probable timing of pathogen infection enables plants to prime their immune system without wasting resources or sacrificing growth. Here, we explore the relationship between the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA), and the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. We found that SA altered circadian rhythmicity through the SA receptor and master transcriptional coactivator, NPR1. Reciprocally, the circadian clock gates SA-induced expression of NPR1-dependent immune genes. Furthermore, the clock gene CCA1 is essential for SA-induced immunity to the major bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. These results reveal new interactions between the circadian clock and SA signaling which produce an effective immune response. Understanding how and why the immune response in plants is linked to the circadian clock is crucial in working towards improved crop productivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that shape gene expression in response to numerous developmental and environmental cues. In animals, several models have been proposed to explain how enhancers integrate the activity of multiple transcription factors. However, it remains largely unknown how plant enhancers integrate transcription factor activity. Here, we use Plant STARR-seq to characterize three light-responsive plant enhancers--AB80, Cab-1, and rbcS-E9--derived from genes active in photosynthesis. Saturation mutagenesis reveals mutations, many of which cluster in short regions, that strongly reduce enhancer activity in the light, in the dark or in both conditions. When tested in the light, these mutation-sensitive regions do not function on their own; rather, cooperative interactions with other such regions are required for full activity. Epistatic interactions occur between mutations in adjacent mutation-sensitive regions, and the spacing and order of mutation-sensitive regions in synthetic enhancers affects enhancer activity. In contrast, when tested in the dark, mutation-sensitive regions act independently and additively in conferring enhancer activity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that plant enhancers show evidence for both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements. This knowledge can be harnessed to design strong, condition-specific synthetic enhancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Image segmentation is commonly used to estimate the location and shape of plants and their external structures. Segmentation masks are then used to localize landmarks of interest and compute other geometric features that correspond to the plants phenotype. Despite its prevalence, segmentation-based approaches are laborious (requiring extensive annotation to train), and error-prone (derived geometric features are sensitive to instance mask integrity). Here we present a segmentation-free approach which leverages deep learning-based landmark detection and grouping, also known as pose estimation. We use a tool originally developed for animal motion capture called SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses) to automate the detection of distinct morphological landmarks on plant roots. Using a gel cylinder imaging system across multiple species, we show that our approach can reliably and efficiently recover root system topology at high accuracy, few annotated samples, and faster speed than segmentation-based approaches. In order to make use of this landmark-based representation for root phenotyping, we developed a Python library (sleap-roots) for trait extraction directly comparable to existing segmentation-based analysis software. We show that landmark-derived root traits are highly accurate and can be used for common downstream tasks including genotype classification and unsupervised trait mapping. Altogether, this work establishes the validity and advantages of pose estimation-based plant phenotyping. To facilitate adoption of this easy-to-use tool and to encourage further development, we make sleap-roots, all training data, models, and trait extraction code available at: https://github.com/talmolab/sleap-roots and https://osf.io/k7j9g/.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zymoseptoria tritici incites Septoria tritici blotch, a disease causing significant annual yield losses in wheat. To investigate infection phase-specific gene expression in the pathogen we analyzed gene expression during infection of susceptible (Taichung 29) and resistant (Veranopolis and Israel 493) wheat cultivars, plus the non-host species barley at 1, 3, 6, 10, 17 and 23 days post-inoculation (DPI). There were dramatic differences in pathogen gene expression at 10 DPI in the compatible compared to both incompatible interactions. The largest differences in pathogen gene expression occurred at 3 DPI in both compatible and incompatible interactions compared to the non-host interaction. Thirty-one putative effectors had early expression in the compatible interaction. Subsequent subcellular localization studies using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that most candidate effectors localized to the nucleus and cytosol, and two localized to mobile cytosolic bodies, suggesting involvement in intracellular signaling or host gene regulation. Mycgr3109710, which localized to cytosolic bodies, belongs to the non-plant PR-1-like protein family implicated in virulence in other pathogens. Comparison of pathogen gene expression in resistant and susceptible hosts, in which an initial colonization is established, versus in the non-host species, allowed us to identify genes involved in establishing infection. Comparison of the compatible and incompatible interactions identified pathogen genes involved in transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth at 10 DPI. In addition, we contribute to the understanding of candidate effectors that are activated early during infection and might be involved in the initial plant immunity suppression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are soluble cellular messengers that integrate environmental cues to induce adaptive responses in eukaryotes. In plants, the biological functions of various PP-InsP species are poorly understood, largely due to the absence of canonical enzymes present in other eukaryotes. The recent identification of a new PP-InsP isomer with yet unknown enantiomeric identity, 4/6-InsP7 in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, further highlights the intricate PP-InsP signalling network employed by plants. The abundance of 4/6-InsP7 in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7 is the major PP-InsP species present across land plants. Our findings demonstrate that the Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homolog, AtIPK2 generates 4/6-InsP7 in vitro. Furthermore, the cellular level of 4/6-InsP7 is controlled by the two Arabidopsis IPMK isoforms, AtIPK2 and AtIPK2{beta}. Notably, the activity of these IPMK proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation in Arabidopsis. During heat stress, the expression of genes encoding various heat shock proteins controlled by the heat shock factors (HSFs) is affected in the AtIPK2-deficient plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of HSF is regulated by the AtIPK2 proteins. Our parallel investigations using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha suggest that the InsP6 kinase activity of IPMK and the role of IPMK in regulating the heat stress response are evolutionarily conserved. Collectively, our study indicates that IPMK has played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Green feather algae (Bryopsidales) undergo a unique life cycle in which a single cell repeatedly executes nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in the development of a thallus (&gt; 100 mm) with characteristic morphology called coenocyte. Bryopsis is a representative coenocytic alga that has exceptionally high regeneration ability: extruded cytoplasm aggregates rapidly in seawater, leading to the formation of protoplasts. However, the genetic basis of the unique cell biology of Bryopsis remains poorly understood. Here, we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the nuclear genome of Bryopsis sp. (90.7 Mbp, 27 contigs, N50 = 6.7 Mbp, 14,034 protein-coding genes). Comparative genomic analyses indicate that the genes encoding BPL-1/Bryohealin, the aggregation-promoting lectin, are heavily duplicated in Bryopsis, whereas homologous genes are absent in other Ulvophycean algae, suggesting the basis of regeneration capability of Bryopsis. Bryopsis sp. possesses &gt;30 kinesins but only a single myosin, which differs from other green algae that have multiple types of myosin genes. Consistent with this biased motor toolkit, we observed that the bidirectional motility of chloroplasts in the cytoplasm was dependent on microtubules but not actin in Bryopsis sp. Unexpectedly, most genes required for cytokinesis in plants are present in Bryopsis, including those in the SNARE or kinesin superfamily. Nevertheless, a kinesin crucial for cytokinesis initiation in plants (NACK/Kinesin-7II) is hardly expressed in the coenocytic part of the thallus, possibly underlying the lack of cytokinesis in this portion. The present genome sequence lays the foundation for experimental biology in coenocytic macroalgae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnthocyanins represent one of the most abundant coloration factors found in plants. Biological functions of anthocyanins range from reproduction to protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. Owing to a clearly visible phenotype of mutants, the anthocyanin biosynthesis and its sophisticated regulation have been studied in numerous plant species. Genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes are regulated by a transcription factor complex comprising MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins.

ResultsA systematic comparison of anthocyanin-pigmented vs. non-pigmented varieties across flowering plant species was performed. Literature was screened for cases in which genetic factors causing anthocyanin loss were reported. Additionally, transcriptomic data sets from previous studies were reanalyzed to determine the genes most likely to be responsible for color variation based on their expression pattern. The contribution of different structural and regulatory genes to the pigmentation differences was quantified. Gene expression differences concerning transcription factors are by far the most frequent explanation for pigmentation differences observed between two varieties of the same species. Among the transcription factors in the analyzed cases, MYB genes are substantially more likely to explain pigmentation differences than bHLH or WD40 genes.

ConclusionsThese findings support previous assumptions about the plasticity of transcriptional regulation and its importance for the evolution of novel coloration phenotypes. Our findings underline the particular significance of MYBs and their apparent dominant role in the specificity of the MBW complex.</p>
