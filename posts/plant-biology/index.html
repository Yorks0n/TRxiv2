Y.; Clavel, M.; Tumtas, Y.; Mohseni, A.; Picchianti, L.; Jamshidiha, M.; Pandey, P.; Duggan, C.; Cota, E.; Dagdas, Y.; Bozkurt, T. O.\nScore: 43.9, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547386\nPlants rely on autophagy and membrane trafficking to tolerate stress, combat infections, and maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular interplay between autophagy and membrane trafficking is poorly understood. Using an AI-assisted approach, we identified Rab3GAP-like (Rab3GAPL) as an important membrane trafficking node that controls plant autophagy negatively. Rab3GAPL suppresses autophagy by binding to ATG8, the core autophagy adaptor, and deactivating Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for autophagosome formation and defense-related secretion. Rab3GAPL from Nicotiana benthamiana, but not its mutated form deficient in ATG8 binding, reduced autophagic flux in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, Rab3GAPL-knockout mutants of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha exhibited enhanced autophagic flux under both normal and heat stress conditions, suggesting that the negative regulatory role of Rab3GAPL in autophagy is conserved in land plants. Beyond autophagy regulation, Rab3GAPL modulates focal immunity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans by preventing defense-related secretion. Altogether, our results suggest that Rab3GAPL acts as a molecular rheostat to coordinate autophagic flux and defense-related secretion by restraining Rab8a-mediated trafficking. This unprecedented interplay between a RabGAP-Rab pair and ATG8 sheds new light on the intricate membrane transport mechanisms underlying plant autophagy and immunity.\nComparisons of two receptor pathways in a single cell-type reveal features of signalling specificity.\nAuthors: Ma, Y.; Fluckiger, I.; Nicolet, J.; Pang, J.; Dickinson, J.; De Bellis, D.; Emonet, A.; Fujita, S.; Geldner, N.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547518\nTo respond appropriately to diverse stimuli, cells harbour numerous receptor pathways yet share downstream signalling components. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) cascades, present in all eukaryotes, act as central hubs shared amongst diverse signalling pathways. How signalling specificity is maintained within a single plant cell-type is not well understood. We engineered a genetic background for direct comparisons of a developmental and an immunity pathway in the Arabidopsis root endodermis. We show the two pathways maintain distinct outputs despite similar MPK phosphorylation patterns. Systematic activation of all individual MPK Kinases (MKKs) in the endodermis revealed that different MKK groups can drive distinct outputs. We propose that specificity is achieved through a balance of combinatorial activation and cross-pathway inhibition within the MPK cascade. Our findings demonstrate the ability of MPK cascades to generate diverse outputs in one plant cell-type, providing new insights into the mechanisms contributing to signalling specificity.\nSmall proteins modulate ion channel-like ACD6 to regulate immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Li, L.; Kim, J.; Neuhaeuser, B.; Wang, M.; Thelen, M.; Hilleary, R.; Chi, Y.; Wei, L.; Venkataramani, K.; Exposito-Alonso, M.; Liu, C.; Keck, J.; Barragan, A. C.; Schwab, R.; Lutz, U.; Pei, Z.; He, S.-Y.; Ludewig, U.; Weigel, D.; Zhu, W.\nScore: 42.7, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2021.01.25.428077\nACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) mediates a trade-off between growth and defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the precise biochemical mechanism by which ACD6 and related proteins in plants act remains enigmatic. Here, we identified two loci, MODULATOR OF HYPERACTIVE ACD6 1 (MHA1) and its paralog MHA1-LIKE (MHA1L), that code for ~7 kDa proteins that differentially interact with specific ACD6 variants. MHA1L enhances accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. ACD6 is a multipass transmembrane protein with intracellular ankyrin repeats that are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels. Several lines of evidence link increased ACD6 activity to enhanced calcium influx, likely mediated by ACD6 itself and with MHA1L as a direct regulator of ACD6.\nPolyploidy enhances desiccation tolerance in the grass Microchloa caffra\nAuthors: Marks, R. A.; Delgado, P.; Makonya, G. M.; Cooper, K.; VanBuren, R.; Farrant, J. M.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545583\nDesiccation tolerance evolved recurrently across diverse plant lineages to enable survival in water limited conditions. Many resurrection plants are polyploid and several groups have hypothesized that polyploidy enabled the evolution of desiccation tolerance. However, due to the vast evolutionary divergence between resurrection plant lineages, the rarity of desiccation tolerance, and the prevalence of polyploidy in plants, this hypothesis has been difficult to test. Here, we surveyed variation in morphological, reproductive, and desiccation tolerance traits across natural populations of a single species that has differing ploidies and tested for links between polyploidy and resilience. We sampled multiple populations of the resurrection grass Microchloa caffra across an environmental gradient ranging from mesic to xeric in South Africa. We describe two distinct ecotypes of M. caffra that occupy different ends of the environmental gradient and exhibit consistent differences in ploidy, morphological, reproductive, and desiccation tolerance traits in both field and common growth conditions. Interestingly, plants with more polyploid genomes were consistently more desiccation tolerant, less reproductive, and larger than plants with smaller genomes and lower ploidy. These data suggest that polyploidy enhances desiccation tolerance and that stronger selective pressures in increasingly xeric sites may play a role in maintaining and increasing desiccation tolerance.\nFungal small RNAs ride in extracellular vesicles to enter plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis\nAuthors: He, B.; Wang, H.; Liu, G.; Chen, A.; Cai, Q.; Jin, H.\nScore: 22.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545159\nSmall RNAs (sRNAs) of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea can enter plant cells and hijack host Argonaute protein 1 (AGO1) to silence host immunity genes. However, the mechanism by which these fungal sRNAs are secreted and enter host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The B. cinerea tetraspanin protein, Punchless 1 (BcPLS1), serves as an EV biomarker and plays an essential role in fungal pathogenicity. We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that fungi secrete sRNAs via EVs, which then enter host plant cells mainly through CME.\nMultifactorial analysis of terminator performance on heterologous gene expression in Physcomitrella\nAuthors: Niederau, P. A.; Egle, P.; Willig, S.; Parsons, J.; Hoernstein, S. N. W.; Decker, E. L.; Reski, R.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547182\nThe production of recombinant proteins for health applications accounts for a large share of the biopharmaceutical market. While many drugs are produced in microbial and mammalian systems, plants gain more attention as expression hosts to produce eukaryotic proteins. In particular the GMP-compliant moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens) has outstanding features such as excellent genetic amenability, reproducible bioreactor cultivation, and humanized protein glycosylation patterns. In this study, we selected and characterized new terminators for their effects on heterologous gene expression. The Physcomitrella genome contains 53,346 unique 3UTRs (untranslated regions) of which 7,964 transcripts contain at least one intron. Over 91% of 3UTRs exhibit more than one polyadenylation site, indicating the prevalence of alternative polyadenylation in Physcomitrella. Out of all 3UTRs, 14 terminator candidates were selected and characterized via transient Dual Luciferase assays, yielding a collection of endogenous terminators performing equally high as established heterologous terminators CaMV35S, AtHSP90, and NOS. High performing candidates were selected for testing as double terminators which impact reporter levels, dependent on terminator identity and positioning. Testing of 3UTRs among the different promoters NOS, CaMV35S, and PpActin5 showed an increase of more than 1,000-fold between promoters PpActin5 and NOS, whereas terminators increased reporter levels by less than 10-fold, demonstrating the stronger effect promoters play as compared to terminators. The number of polyadenylation sites as well as polyadenylation signals were found to be major determinants of terminator performance. Our results improve the biotechnology platform Physcomitrella and further our understanding of how terminators influence gene expression in plants in general.\nRNA-directed DNA Methylation is required for seed development in outbreeding species\nAuthors: Dew-Budd, K. J.; Chow, H. T.; Kendall, T.; David, B. C.; Rozelle, J. A.; Mosher, R. A.; Beilstein, M. A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547469\nIn plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulation in the maternally-derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, Brassica rapa mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these closely-related species, we produced RdDM mutations in three additional members of the Brassicaceae family: Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, and Capsella grandiflora. Among these three species, only mutations in Capsella grandiflora displayed a seed production defect similar to Brassica rapa mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.\nShedding Light On Blue-Green Photosynthesis: A Wavelength-Dependent Mathematical Model Of Photosynthesis In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803\nAuthors: Pfennig, T.; Kullmann, E.; Zavrel, T.; Nakielski, A.; Ebenhöh, O.; Cerveny, J.; Bernat, G.; Matuszynska, A. B.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547186\nCyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment, in a particular light. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimising strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model accurately predicts the partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O2 evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation. Additionally, it successfully captures chlorophyll fluorescence signals, enabling valuable information extraction. We explore state transition mechanisms, favouring PSII quenching over PBS detachment based on theoretical evidence. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colours and irradiances. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behaviour and supports optimising their metabolism for industrial applications.\nImplementing a framework of carbon and nitrogen feedback responses into a plant resource allocation model\nAuthors: Holland, B. L.; Monk, N. A. M.; Clayton, R. H.; Osborne, C. P.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546727\nO_LIThe allocation of resources to roots and shoots can greatly alter total plant mass. Allocation is thought to be the consequence of growth processes (i.e uptake rates, transport rates, growth rates) and the communication between them via signalling mechanisms. Feedbacks that alter growth processes are induced in nature by changes in the internal pools of carbon and nitrogen, but how these function together to define allocation remains unclear. C_LIO_LIWe introduce a framework model of internal feedback responses to changes in plant carbon and nitrogen concentrations. We evaluate how well the model responds to changes in carbon and nitrogen availability by simulating external environmental perturbations that influence the uptake of resources. C_LIO_LIThe model reflects experimental results when looking at the effect of atmospheric CO2 and soil nitrogen concentrations on total plant mass and replicates observed responses to leaf defoliation events. Overall this shows that a combination of known signalling mechanisms are sufficient to reproduce experimentally observed responses to external resource availability. C_LIO_LIModel simulations highlight key areas of uncertainty where more empirical data is needed. In particular, quantitative data is needed to establish the strengths and rates at which feedback responses to carbon and nitrogen substrate concentrations alter growth and uptake rates.

K.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547269\nPlants have the ability to perceive a slight upsurge in ambient temperature and respond by undergoing morphological changes, such as elongated hypocotyls and early flowering. The dynamic functioning of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) in thermomorphogenesis has been well established, although the regulatory pathway involved in thermosensing is not deciphered completely. In our study, we demonstrate that an increase in temperature from 22oC to 28oC induces the phosphorylation of PIF4 by MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 4 (MPK4) which shows high expression and activation at 28?C. Apparently, phosphorylated PIF4 represses the expression of ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6) that is required for mediating histone variant H2A.Z deposition at its target gene loci. We demonstrate that variation of ARP6 expression in PIF4 phosphor -null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings affects hypocotyl growth and flowering at 22oC and 28oC. Further, we show that change in ARP6 expression affects H2A.Z deposition at the loci of genes involved in hypocotyl elongation using PIF4 phosphor-null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings. Interestingly, the expression of MPK4 is also controlled by H2A.Z deposition in temperature dependent manner. Taken together, our findings highlight the cumulative molecular interplay between MPK4, PIF4, and chromatin modification by ARP6-mediated H2A.Z deposition as a regulatory mechanism of thermosensing.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Plants rely on autophagy and membrane trafficking to tolerate stress, combat infections, and maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular interplay between autophagy and membrane trafficking is poorly understood. Using an AI-assisted approach, we identified Rab3GAP-like (Rab3GAPL) as an important membrane trafficking node that controls plant autophagy negatively. Rab3GAPL suppresses autophagy by binding to ATG8, the core autophagy adaptor, and deactivating Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for autophagosome formation and defense-related secretion. Rab3GAPL from Nicotiana benthamiana, but not its mutated form deficient in ATG8 binding, reduced autophagic flux in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, Rab3GAPL-knockout mutants of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha exhibited enhanced autophagic flux under both normal and heat stress conditions, suggesting that the negative regulatory role of Rab3GAPL in autophagy is conserved in land plants. Beyond autophagy regulation, Rab3GAPL modulates focal immunity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans by preventing defense-related secretion. Altogether, our results suggest that Rab3GAPL acts as a molecular rheostat to coordinate autophagic flux and defense-related secretion by restraining Rab8a-mediated trafficking. This unprecedented interplay between a RabGAP-Rab pair and ATG8 sheds new light on the intricate membrane transport mechanisms underlying plant autophagy and immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To respond appropriately to diverse stimuli, cells harbour numerous receptor pathways yet share downstream signalling components. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) cascades, present in all eukaryotes, act as central hubs shared amongst diverse signalling pathways. How signalling specificity is maintained within a single plant cell-type is not well understood. We engineered a genetic background for direct comparisons of a developmental and an immunity pathway in the Arabidopsis root endodermis. We show the two pathways maintain distinct outputs despite similar MPK phosphorylation patterns. Systematic activation of all individual MPK Kinases (MKKs) in the endodermis revealed that different MKK groups can drive distinct outputs. We propose that specificity is achieved through a balance of combinatorial activation and cross-pathway inhibition within the MPK cascade. Our findings demonstrate the ability of MPK cascades to generate diverse outputs in one plant cell-type, providing new insights into the mechanisms contributing to signalling specificity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) mediates a trade-off between growth and defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the precise biochemical mechanism by which ACD6 and related proteins in plants act remains enigmatic. Here, we identified two loci, MODULATOR OF HYPERACTIVE ACD6 1 (MHA1) and its paralog MHA1-LIKE (MHA1L), that code for ~7 kDa proteins that differentially interact with specific ACD6 variants. MHA1L enhances accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. ACD6 is a multipass transmembrane protein with intracellular ankyrin repeats that are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels. Several lines of evidence link increased ACD6 activity to enhanced calcium influx, likely mediated by ACD6 itself and with MHA1L as a direct regulator of ACD6.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Desiccation tolerance evolved recurrently across diverse plant lineages to enable survival in water limited conditions. Many resurrection plants are polyploid and several groups have hypothesized that polyploidy enabled the evolution of desiccation tolerance. However, due to the vast evolutionary divergence between resurrection plant lineages, the rarity of desiccation tolerance, and the prevalence of polyploidy in plants, this hypothesis has been difficult to test. Here, we surveyed variation in morphological, reproductive, and desiccation tolerance traits across natural populations of a single species that has differing ploidies and tested for links between polyploidy and resilience. We sampled multiple populations of the resurrection grass Microchloa caffra across an environmental gradient ranging from mesic to xeric in South Africa. We describe two distinct ecotypes of M. caffra that occupy different ends of the environmental gradient and exhibit consistent differences in ploidy, morphological, reproductive, and desiccation tolerance traits in both field and common growth conditions. Interestingly, plants with more polyploid genomes were consistently more desiccation tolerant, less reproductive, and larger than plants with smaller genomes and lower ploidy. These data suggest that polyploidy enhances desiccation tolerance and that stronger selective pressures in increasingly xeric sites may play a role in maintaining and increasing desiccation tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small RNAs (sRNAs) of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea can enter plant cells and hijack host Argonaute protein 1 (AGO1) to silence host immunity genes. However, the mechanism by which these fungal sRNAs are secreted and enter host cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that B. cinerea utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs) to secrete Bc-sRNAs, which are then internalized by plant cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The B. cinerea tetraspanin protein, Punchless 1 (BcPLS1), serves as an EV biomarker and plays an essential role in fungal pathogenicity. We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants. Together, our results demonstrate that fungi secrete sRNAs via EVs, which then enter host plant cells mainly through CME.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The production of recombinant proteins for health applications accounts for a large share of the biopharmaceutical market. While many drugs are produced in microbial and mammalian systems, plants gain more attention as expression hosts to produce eukaryotic proteins. In particular the GMP-compliant moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens) has outstanding features such as excellent genetic amenability, reproducible bioreactor cultivation, and humanized protein glycosylation patterns. In this study, we selected and characterized new terminators for their effects on heterologous gene expression. The Physcomitrella genome contains 53,346 unique 3UTRs (untranslated regions) of which 7,964 transcripts contain at least one intron. Over 91% of 3UTRs exhibit more than one polyadenylation site, indicating the prevalence of alternative polyadenylation in Physcomitrella. Out of all 3UTRs, 14 terminator candidates were selected and characterized via transient Dual Luciferase assays, yielding a collection of endogenous terminators performing equally high as established heterologous terminators CaMV35S, AtHSP90, and NOS. High performing candidates were selected for testing as double terminators which impact reporter levels, dependent on terminator identity and positioning. Testing of 3UTRs among the different promoters NOS, CaMV35S, and PpActin5 showed an increase of more than 1,000-fold between promoters PpActin5 and NOS, whereas terminators increased reporter levels by less than 10-fold, demonstrating the stronger effect promoters play as compared to terminators. The number of polyadenylation sites as well as polyadenylation signals were found to be major determinants of terminator performance. Our results improve the biotechnology platform Physcomitrella and further our understanding of how terminators influence gene expression in plants in general.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulation in the maternally-derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, Brassica rapa mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these closely-related species, we produced RdDM mutations in three additional members of the Brassicaceae family: Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, and Capsella grandiflora. Among these three species, only mutations in Capsella grandiflora displayed a seed production defect similar to Brassica rapa mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment, in a particular light. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimising strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model accurately predicts the partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O2 evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation. Additionally, it successfully captures chlorophyll fluorescence signals, enabling valuable information extraction. We explore state transition mechanisms, favouring PSII quenching over PBS detachment based on theoretical evidence. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colours and irradiances. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behaviour and supports optimising their metabolism for industrial applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIThe allocation of resources to roots and shoots can greatly alter total plant mass. Allocation is thought to be the consequence of growth processes (i.e uptake rates, transport rates, growth rates) and the communication between them via signalling mechanisms. Feedbacks that alter growth processes are induced in nature by changes in the internal pools of carbon and nitrogen, but how these function together to define allocation remains unclear.
C_LIO_LIWe introduce a framework model of internal feedback responses to changes in plant carbon and nitrogen concentrations. We evaluate how well the model responds to changes in carbon and nitrogen availability by simulating external environmental perturbations that influence the uptake of resources.
C_LIO_LIThe model reflects experimental results when looking at the effect of atmospheric CO2 and soil nitrogen concentrations on total plant mass and replicates observed responses to leaf defoliation events. Overall this shows that a combination of known signalling mechanisms are sufficient to reproduce experimentally observed responses to external resource availability.
C_LIO_LIModel simulations highlight key areas of uncertainty where more empirical data is needed. In particular, quantitative data is needed to establish the strengths and rates at which feedback responses to carbon and nitrogen substrate concentrations alter growth and uptake rates.

        <p class="abstract">Plants have the ability to perceive a slight upsurge in ambient temperature and respond by undergoing morphological changes, such as elongated hypocotyls and early flowering. The dynamic functioning of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) in thermomorphogenesis has been well established, although the regulatory pathway involved in thermosensing is not deciphered completely. In our study, we demonstrate that an increase in temperature from 22oC to 28oC induces the phosphorylation of PIF4 by MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 4 (MPK4) which shows high expression and activation at 28?C. Apparently, phosphorylated PIF4 represses the expression of ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6) that is required for mediating histone variant H2A.Z deposition at its target gene loci. We demonstrate that variation of ARP6 expression in PIF4 phosphor -null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings affects hypocotyl growth and flowering at 22oC and 28oC. Further, we show that change in ARP6 expression affects H2A.Z deposition at the loci of genes involved in hypocotyl elongation using PIF4 phosphor-null and phosphor-mimetic seedlings. Interestingly, the expression of MPK4 is also controlled by H2A.Z deposition in temperature dependent manner. Taken together, our findings highlight the cumulative molecular interplay between MPK4, PIF4, and chromatin modification by ARP6-mediated H2A.Z deposition as a regulatory mechanism of thermosensing.</p>
