However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.\nActivation of plant immunity through conversion of a helper NLR homodimer into a resistosome\nAuthors: Selvaraj, M.; Toghani, A.; Pai, H.; Sugihara, Y.; Kourelis, J.; Yuen, E. L. H.; Ibrahim, T.; Zhao, H.; Xie, R.; Maqbool, A.; De la Concepcion, J. C.; Banfield, M. J.; Derevnina, L.; Petre, B.; Lawson, D. M.; Bozkurt, T. O.; Wu, C.-H.; Kamoun, S.; Contreras, M. P.\nScore: 60.9, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.17.572070\nNucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The Cryo-EM structure of NRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.\nPlant plasmodesmata bridges form through ER-driven incomplete cytokinesis\nAuthors: Li, Z. P.; Moreau, H.; Petit, J. D.; Souza-Moraes, T.; Smokvarska, M.; Perez-Sancho, J.; Petrel, M.; Decoeur, F.; Brocard, L.; Chambaud, C.; Grison, M.; Paterlini, A.; Hoornaert, L.; Joshi, A. S.; Gontier, E.; Prinz, W. A.; Jaillais, Y.; Taly, A.; Campelo, F.; Caillaud, M.-c.; Bayer, E. M.\nScore: 47.0, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571296\nDiverging from conventional cell division models, plant cells undergo incomplete division to generate plasmodesmata communication bridges between daughter cells. While fundamental for plant multicellularity, the mechanisms governing bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. We found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is decisive in promoting incomplete cytokinesis by inhibiting local abscission events. ER tubes within contracting cell plate fenestrae create energy barriers preventing full closure. Contraction ceases upon encountering a metastable ER-plasma membrane tubular structure, leading to plasmodesmata formation. This process relies on the ER-tethers multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins 3, 4, and 6, which act as ER stabilizers, preserving ER position and integrity in nascent bridges. Our findings unveil the mechanisms through which plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication. One-Sentence SummaryUninterrupted ER connections obstruct abscission, causing incomplete cytokinesis and plasmodesmata formation in plants.\nER-anchored protein sorting controls the fate of two proteasome activators for intracellular organelle communication during proteotoxic stress\nAuthors: Langin, G.; Raffeiner, M.; Biermann, D.; Franz-Wachtel, M.; Spinti, D.; Börnke, F.; Macek, B.; Üstün, S.\nScore: 31.6, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.571118\nProteotoxic stress, characterized by the accumulation of damaged proteins, poses a significant challenge to cellular homeostasis. To mitigate proteotoxicity eukaryotes employ the proteasome that is regulated by proteasome activators, e.g. transcription factors that promote gene expression of proteasome subunits. As proteotoxicity originates in different compartments, cells need to perceive signals from various locations. Understanding which components integrate signals to address proteotoxicity is essential to develop strategies to cope with proteotoxicity but remain elusive. Here, we identify that the proteasome autoregulatory feedback loop acts as a gatekeeper to facilitate the communication between nucleus and chloroplast. We reveal that the ER-anchored protein sorting system (ERAPS) controls the proteasomal degradation or nuclear translocation of proteasome activators NAC53 and NAC78. While both transcription factors activate the proteasome gene expression, they repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes during proteotoxicity. Collectively, our discoveries provide a novel conceptual framework in which the proteasome autoregulatory feedback loop coordinates subcellular proteostasis.\nThe leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase QSK1 is a novel regulator of PRR-RBOHD complex and is employed by the bacterial effector HopF2Pto to modulate plant immunity\nAuthors: Goto, Y.; Kadota, Y.; Mbengue, M.; Lewis, J. D.; Matsui, H.; Maki, N.; Sklenar, J.; Derbyshire, P.; Shibata, A.; Ichihashi, Y.; Guttman, D.; Nakagami, H.; Suzuki, T.; Menke, F. L. H.; Robatzek, S.; Desveaux, D.; Zipfel, C.; Shirasu, K.\nScore: 25.7, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571443\nPlants detect pathogens using cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like EFR and FLS2, which recognize bacterial EF-Tu and flagellin, respectively. These PRRs, belonging to the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) family, activate the production of reactive oxygen species via the NADPH oxidase RBOHD. The PRR-RBOHD complex is tightly regulated to prevent unwarranted or exaggerated immune responses. However, certain pathogenic effectors can subvert these regulatory mechanisms, thereby suppressing plant immunity. To elucidate the intricate dynamics of the PRR-RBOHD complex, we conducted a comparative co-immunoprecipitation analysis using EFR, FLS2, and RBOHD. We identified QSK1, an LRR-RK, as a novel component of the PRR-RBOHD complex. QSK1 functions as a negative regulator of PRR-triggered immunity (PTI) by downregulating the abundance of FLS2 and EFR. QSK1 is targeted by the bacterial effector HopF2Pto, a mono-ADP ribosyltransferase, resulting in the reduction of FLS2 and EFR levels through both transcriptional and transcription-independent pathways, thereby inhibiting PTI. Furthermore, HopF2Pto reduces transcript levels of PROSCOOP genes encoding important stress-regulated phytocytokines and their receptor MIK2. Importantly, HopF2Pto requires QSK1 for its accumulation and virulence functions within plants. In summary, our results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which HopF2Pto employs QSK1 to desensitize plants to pathogen attack. One Sentence SummaryQSK1, a novel component in the plant immune receptor complex, downregulates these receptors and phytocytokines, and is exploited by bacterial effector HopF2Pto to desensitize plants to pathogen attack.\nFunctional divergence shaped the network architecture of plant immune receptors\nAuthors: Huang, C.-Y.; Huang, Y.-S.; Sugihara, Y.; Wang, H.-Y.; Huang, L.-T.; Lopez-Agudelo, J. C.; Chen, Y.-F.; Lin, K.-Y.; Chiang, B.-J.; Toghani, A.; Kourelis, J.; Derevnina, L.; Wu, C.-H.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571219\nIn solanaceous plants, several sensor NLRs and their helper NLRs, known as NRC, form a complex network to confer immunity against pathogens. While the sensor NLRs and downstream NRC helpers display diverse genetic compatibility, the evolution and molecular basis of the complex network structure remained elusive. Here we demonstrated that functional divergence of NRC3 variants has shaped the genetic architecture of the NLR network. Natural NRC3 variants form three allelic groups displaying distinct compatibilities with sensor NLRs. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and analyses of natural and chimeric variants identified six key amino acids involved in sensor-helper compatibility, with two residues critical for subfunctionalization. Co-functioning Rpi-blb2 and NRC3 variants showed stronger transient interactions upon effector detection, with NRC3 membrane-associated complexes forming subsequently. Our findings reveal how mutations in helper NLRs, particularly NRC3, have driven the evolution of their transient interactions with sensor NLRs, leading to subfunctionalization and contributing significantly to the complexity of the NRC network in plant immunity. TeaserHelper NLR subfunctionalization alters transient interactions with sensor NLRs, enhancing plant immune system complexity.\nPlasmodesmata act as unconventional membrane contact sites regulating inter-cellular molecular exchange in plants\nAuthors: Smokvarska, M.; Perez-Sancho, J.; Glavier, M.; Sritharan, S.; Dubois, G.; Dietrich, V.; Platre, M. P.; Li, Z. P.; Paterlini, A.; Moreau, H.; Fouillen, L.; GRISON, M. S.; Cana-Quijada, P.; Moraes, T. S.; Immel, F.; Wattelet, V.; Ducros, M.; Brocard, L.; Chambaud, C.; Zabrady, M.; Luo, Y.; Busch, W.; Tilsner, J.; Helariutta, Y.; Russinova, J.; Taly, A.; Jaillais, Y.; Bayer, E.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572149\nMembrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCS's diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities.\nThe activated plant NRC4 immune receptor forms a hexameric resistosome\nAuthors: Liu, F.; Yang, Z.; Wang, C.; Martin, R.; Qiao, W.; Carette, J. E.; Luan, S.; Nogales, E.; Staskawicz, B.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571367\nInnate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as helper NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with sensor NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses.\nModulation of cell differentiation and growth dynamics underlie the shift from bud protection to light capture in cauline leaves\nAuthors: Kierzkowski, D.; Le Gloanec, C.; Gomez-Felipe, A.; Alimchandani, V.; Branchini, E.; Routier-Kierzkowska, A.-L.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571562\nPlant organs have evolved into diverse shapes for specialized functions despite emerging as simple protrusions at the shoot apex. Cauline leaves serve both as photosynthetic organs and protective structures for emerging floral buds. However, the growth patterns underlying this dual function remain unknown. Here, we investigate the developmental dynamics shaping cauline leaves underlying their functional diversification from other laminar organs. We show that cauline leaves display a significant delay in overall elongation compared to rosette leaves. Using live imaging, we reveal that their functional divergence hinges on early modulation of the timing of cell differentiation and cellular growth rates. In contrast to rosette leaves and sepals, cell differentiation is delayed in cauline leaves, fostering extended proliferation, prolonged morphogenetic activity, and growth redistribution within the organ. Notably, cauline leaf growth is transiently suppressed during the early stages, keeping the leaf small and unfolded during the initiation of the first flowers. Our findings highlight the unique developmental timing of cauline leaves, underlying their shift from an early protective role to a later photosynthetic function. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYThe dual function of the cauline leaf in protection and light capture is achieved during development through a delay of cell differentiation, growth redistribution, and transient growth decrease.\nHop stunt viroid infection alters host heterochromatin\nAuthors: Marquez-Molins, J.; Cheng, J.; Corell-Sierra, J.; Juarez-Gonzalez, V. T.; Villalba-Bermell, P.; Annacondia, M. L.; Gomez, G.; Martinez, G.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571286\nViroids are pathogenic non-coding RNAs that completely rely on their host molecular machinery to accomplish their life cycle. Several interactions between viroids and their host molecular machinery have been identified, including an interference with epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. Despite this, whether viroids influence changes in other epigenetic marks such as histone modifications remained unknown. Epigenetic regulation is particularly important during pathogenesis processes because it might be a key regulator of the dynamism of the defense response. Here we have analyzed the changes taking place in Cucumis sativus facultative and constitutive heterochromatin during hop stunt viroid (HSVd) infection using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of the two main heterochromatic marks: H3K9me2 and H3K27me3. We find that HSVd infection is associated with changes in both H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, with a tendency to decrease the levels of repressive epigenetic marks through infection progression. These epigenetic changes are connected to the transcriptional regulation of their expected targets, genes and transposable elements. Indeed, several genes related to the defense response are targets of both epigenetic marks. Our results highlight another host regulatory mechanism affected by viroid infection, providing further information about the complexity of the multiple layers of interactions between pathogens/viroids and hosts/plants.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) confer disease resistance to a multitude of foliar and root parasites of plants. However, the extent to which NLR immunity is expressed differentially between plant organs is poorly known. Here, we show that a large cluster of tomato genes, which encodes the cyst and root-knot nematode disease resistance proteins Hero and MeR1 as well as the NLR-helper NRC6, exhibits nearly exclusive expression in the roots. This root-specific gene cluster emerged in Solanum species about 21 million years ago through gene duplication from the ancient NRC network of asterid plants. NLR-sensors in this gene cluster exclusively signal through NRC6 helpers to trigger the hypersensitive cell death immune response. These findings indicate that the NRC6 gene cluster has sub-functionalized from the larger NRC network to specialize for resistance against root pathogens, including cyst and root-knot nematodes. We propose that NLR gene clusters and networks have evolved organ-specific gene expression as an adaptation to particular parasites and to reduce the risk of autoimmunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The Cryo-EM structure of NRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverging from conventional cell division models, plant cells undergo incomplete division to generate plasmodesmata communication bridges between daughter cells. While fundamental for plant multicellularity, the mechanisms governing bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. We found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is decisive in promoting incomplete cytokinesis by inhibiting local abscission events. ER tubes within contracting cell plate fenestrae create energy barriers preventing full closure. Contraction ceases upon encountering a metastable ER-plasma membrane tubular structure, leading to plasmodesmata formation. This process relies on the ER-tethers multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins 3, 4, and 6, which act as ER stabilizers, preserving ER position and integrity in nascent bridges. Our findings unveil the mechanisms through which plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.

        <p class="abstract">Proteotoxic stress, characterized by the accumulation of damaged proteins, poses a significant challenge to cellular homeostasis. To mitigate proteotoxicity eukaryotes employ the proteasome that is regulated by proteasome activators, e.g. transcription factors that promote gene expression of proteasome subunits. As proteotoxicity originates in different compartments, cells need to perceive signals from various locations. Understanding which components integrate signals to address proteotoxicity is essential to develop strategies to cope with proteotoxicity but remain elusive. Here, we identify that the proteasome autoregulatory feedback loop acts as a gatekeeper to facilitate the communication between nucleus and chloroplast. We reveal that the ER-anchored protein sorting system (ERAPS) controls the proteasomal degradation or nuclear translocation of proteasome activators NAC53 and NAC78. While both transcription factors activate the proteasome gene expression, they repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes during proteotoxicity. Collectively, our discoveries provide a novel conceptual framework in which the proteasome autoregulatory feedback loop coordinates subcellular proteostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants detect pathogens using cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like EFR and FLS2, which recognize bacterial EF-Tu and flagellin, respectively. These PRRs, belonging to the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) family, activate the production of reactive oxygen species via the NADPH oxidase RBOHD. The PRR-RBOHD complex is tightly regulated to prevent unwarranted or exaggerated immune responses. However, certain pathogenic effectors can subvert these regulatory mechanisms, thereby suppressing plant immunity. To elucidate the intricate dynamics of the PRR-RBOHD complex, we conducted a comparative co-immunoprecipitation analysis using EFR, FLS2, and RBOHD. We identified QSK1, an LRR-RK, as a novel component of the PRR-RBOHD complex. QSK1 functions as a negative regulator of PRR-triggered immunity (PTI) by downregulating the abundance of FLS2 and EFR. QSK1 is targeted by the bacterial effector HopF2Pto, a mono-ADP ribosyltransferase, resulting in the reduction of FLS2 and EFR levels through both transcriptional and transcription-independent pathways, thereby inhibiting PTI. Furthermore, HopF2Pto reduces transcript levels of PROSCOOP genes encoding important stress-regulated phytocytokines and their receptor MIK2. Importantly, HopF2Pto requires QSK1 for its accumulation and virulence functions within plants. In summary, our results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which HopF2Pto employs QSK1 to desensitize plants to pathogen attack.

        <p class="abstract">In solanaceous plants, several sensor NLRs and their helper NLRs, known as NRC, form a complex network to confer immunity against pathogens. While the sensor NLRs and downstream NRC helpers display diverse genetic compatibility, the evolution and molecular basis of the complex network structure remained elusive. Here we demonstrated that functional divergence of NRC3 variants has shaped the genetic architecture of the NLR network. Natural NRC3 variants form three allelic groups displaying distinct compatibilities with sensor NLRs. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and analyses of natural and chimeric variants identified six key amino acids involved in sensor-helper compatibility, with two residues critical for subfunctionalization. Co-functioning Rpi-blb2 and NRC3 variants showed stronger transient interactions upon effector detection, with NRC3 membrane-associated complexes forming subsequently. Our findings reveal how mutations in helper NLRs, particularly NRC3, have driven the evolution of their transient interactions with sensor NLRs, leading to subfunctionalization and contributing significantly to the complexity of the NRC network in plant immunity.

        <p class="abstract">Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are fundamental actors of intracellular communication, but their role in intercellular communication remains unexplored. Here we show that in plants, plasmodesmata cytoplasmic bridges function as atypical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) tubular MCSs, operating at cell-cell interfaces. Similar to other MCSs, ER-PM apposition within plasmodesmata is controlled by a protein-lipid tethering complex. Unlike other MCS however, regulation of membrane contacts primarily serves intercellular communication. Plasmodesmata MCSs act as flow-control valves, effectively regulating molecular transport between cells, by modulating the ER-PM passage size. This occurs through the collaborative action of the ER-anchored Multiple C2 domains and transmembrane domain proteins (MCTP) 3, 4, and 6 tether-complex, and PM-localized PI4P lipid as a binding partner. The MCS flow-control mechanism overrides the well-established plasmodesmata regulator callose, rendering plasmodesmata unable to close in MCTPs absence. Our findings highlight MCS&#39;s diversified functions in transmitting information, spanning from intracellular to intercellular cellular activities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Innate immune responses against microbial pathogens in both plants and animals are regulated by intracellular receptors known as Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeats (NLR) proteins. In plants, these NLRs play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen effectors, thereby initiating the activation of immune defense mechanisms. Notably, certain NLRs serve as helper NLR immune receptors (hNLR), working in tandem with sensor NLR immune receptors (sNLR) counterparts to orchestrate downstream signaling events to express disease resistance. In this study, we reconstituted and determined the cryo-EM structure of the hNLR required for cell death 4 (NRC4) resistosome. The auto-active NRC4 formed a previously unanticipated hexameric configuration, triggering immune responses associated with Ca2&#43; influx into the cytosol. Furthermore, we uncovered a dodecameric state of NRC4, where the coil-coil (CC) domain is embedded within the complex, suggesting an inactive state, and expanding our understanding of the regulation of plant immune responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant organs have evolved into diverse shapes for specialized functions despite emerging as simple protrusions at the shoot apex. Cauline leaves serve both as photosynthetic organs and protective structures for emerging floral buds. However, the growth patterns underlying this dual function remain unknown. Here, we investigate the developmental dynamics shaping cauline leaves underlying their functional diversification from other laminar organs. We show that cauline leaves display a significant delay in overall elongation compared to rosette leaves. Using live imaging, we reveal that their functional divergence hinges on early modulation of the timing of cell differentiation and cellular growth rates. In contrast to rosette leaves and sepals, cell differentiation is delayed in cauline leaves, fostering extended proliferation, prolonged morphogenetic activity, and growth redistribution within the organ. Notably, cauline leaf growth is transiently suppressed during the early stages, keeping the leaf small and unfolded during the initiation of the first flowers. Our findings highlight the unique developmental timing of cauline leaves, underlying their shift from an early protective role to a later photosynthetic function.

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYThe dual function of the cauline leaf in protection and light capture is achieved during development through a delay of cell differentiation, growth redistribution, and transient growth decrease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viroids are pathogenic non-coding RNAs that completely rely on their host molecular machinery to accomplish their life cycle. Several interactions between viroids and their host molecular machinery have been identified, including an interference with epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. Despite this, whether viroids influence changes in other epigenetic marks such as histone modifications remained unknown. Epigenetic regulation is particularly important during pathogenesis processes because it might be a key regulator of the dynamism of the defense response. Here we have analyzed the changes taking place in Cucumis sativus facultative and constitutive heterochromatin during hop stunt viroid (HSVd) infection using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of the two main heterochromatic marks: H3K9me2 and H3K27me3. We find that HSVd infection is associated with changes in both H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, with a tendency to decrease the levels of repressive epigenetic marks through infection progression. These epigenetic changes are connected to the transcriptional regulation of their expected targets, genes and transposable elements. Indeed, several genes related to the defense response are targets of both epigenetic marks. Our results highlight another host regulatory mechanism affected by viroid infection, providing further information about the complexity of the multiple layers of interactions between pathogens/viroids and hosts/plants.</p>
