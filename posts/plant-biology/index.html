R.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553439\nCrop root systems are central to nutrition acquisition and water usage. Root hairs and lateral roots contribute to fine-scale patterning of root systems and can offer many advantages for improving root function without drastically impacting overall system architecture. Key genetic regulators underpinning root hair morphogenesis have been well characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis but are less understood in maize. Here, we identify a novel determinant of root hair morphogenesis and auxin responses in maize, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR27 (ARF27), using both reverse and quantitative genetic approaches. ARF27 is enriched in maize primary root tissues at both the transcript and protein level. Loss of ARF27 leads to short primary roots and reduced root hair formation, while lateral root density is unaltered. In arf27 roots, auxin-responsive gene expression is dysregulated, which is consistent with the predicted function of this transcription factor. Moreover, a genome wide association study (GWAS) to uncover genetic determinants of auxin-dependent root traits identified ARF27 as a candidate gene. Furthermore, auxin hypersensitive maize genotypes exhibit altered crown root length and surface area in field-grown plants. A gene regulatory network (GRN) was reconstructed and an ARF27 subnetwork was integrated with DAP-seq and GWAS data to identify ARF27 target genes. The ARF27 GRN includes known maize root development genes, such as ROOTLESS CONCERNING CROWN ROOTS (RTCS), ROOTHAIRLESS 3 (RTH3) and RTH6. Altogether this work identifies a novel genetic driver of auxin-mediated root morphogenesis in maize that can inform agricultural strategies for improved crop performance.\nSynergistic control of chloroplast biogenesis by MYB-related and Golden2-like transcription factors\nAuthors: Frangedakis, E.; Yelina, N.; Billakurthi, K.; Schreier, T. B.; Dickinson, P. J.; Tomaselli, M.; Haseloff, J.; Hibberd, J. M.\nScore: 12.7, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552970\nChloroplast biogenesis is dependent on master regulators from the Golden2-like (GLK) family of transcription factors, but higher order glk mutants contain residual chlorophyll and therefore other proteins must also be involved. Here we identify MYB-related transcription factors as regulators of chloroplast biogenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana. In both species, double mutant alleles in MYB-Related genes show very limited chloroplast development and photosynthesis gene expression is perturbed to a greater extent than mutants of GLK. In M. polymorpha MYB-related genes act upstream of GLK, while in A. thaliana this relationship has been rewired. In both species, genes encoding enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis are controlled by both MYB-related and GLK proteins whilst those allowing CO2 fixation, photorespiration as well as photosystem assembly and repair require the MYB-related proteins. Thus, MYB-related and GLK genes have overlapping as well as distinct targets. We conclude that MYB-related transcription factors act with GLK to orchestrate chloroplast development in land plants.\nWOX11-mediated adventitious lateral root formation modulates tolerance of Arabidopsis to cyst nematode infections\nAuthors: Willig, J.-J.; Guarneri, N.; van Loon, T.; Wahyuni, S.; Astudillo-Estevez, I. E.; Xu, L.; Willemsen, V.; Goverse, A.; Sterken, M. G.; Lozano-Torres, J. L.; Bakker, J.; Smant, G.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553027\nThe transcription factor WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 (WOX11) in Arabidopsis initiates the formation of adventitious lateral roots upon mechanical injury in primary roots. Root-invading nematodes also induce de novo root organogenesis leading to excessive root branching, but it is not known if this symptom of disease involves mediation by WOX11 and if it benefits the plant. Here, we show with targeted transcriptional repression and reporter gene analyses in Arabidopsis that the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii activates WOX11-adventitious lateral rooting from primary roots close to infection sites. The activation of WOX11 in nematode-infected roots occurs downstream of jasmonic acid-dependent damage signaling via ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR109, linking adventitious lateral root formation to nematode damage to host tissues. By measuring different root system components, we found that WOX11-mediated formation of adventitious lateral roots compensates for nematode-induced inhibition of primary root growth. Our observations further demonstrate that WOX11-mediated rooting reduces the impact of nematode infections on aboveground plant development and growth. Altogether, we conclude that the transcriptional regulation by WOX11 modulates root system plasticity under biotic stress, which is one of the key mechanisms underlying tolerance of Arabidopsis to cyst nematode infections.\nDivergent roles of IREG/Ferroportin transporters from the nickel hyperaccumulator Leucocroton havanensis\nAuthors: Alfonso Gonzalez, D.; Sanchez Garcia de laTorre, V.; Reyes Fernandez, R.; Barreau, L.; MERLOT, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552958\nIn response to our ever-increasing demand for metals, phytotechnologies are being developed to limit the environmental impact of conventional metal mining. However, the development of these technologies, which rely on plant species able to tolerate and accumulate metals, is partly limited by our lack of knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this work, we aimed to identify genes involved in nickel hyperaccumulation in the Euphorbiaceae species Leucocroton havanensis. Using transcriptomic data, we identified two homologous genes, LhavIREG1 and LhavIREG2, encoding divalent metal transporters of the IREG/ferroportin family. Both genes are expressed at similar levels in shoots, but LhavIREG1 shows higher expression in roots. Heterologous expression of these transporters in A. thaliana revealed that LhavIREG1 is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas LhavIREG2 is located at the vacuole. In addition, expression of each gene induced a significant increase in nickel tolerance. Taken together, our data suggest that LhavIREG2 is involved in nickel sequestration in vacuoles of leaf cells, whereas LhavIREG1 is mainly involved in nickel translocation from roots to shoots, but could also be involved in metal sequestration in cell walls. Our results suggest that paralogous IREG/ferroportin transporters may play complementary roles in nickel hyperaccumulation in plants. HighlightThe nickel hyperaccumulator Leucocroton havanensis endemic to Cuba, expresses two paralogous metal transporters of the IREG/ferroportin family that play distinct but complementary roles in nickel tolerance and accumulation.\nGreenMemTraX: A User-Friendly Software for Super-Resolution Analysis of Membrane Protein Dynamics and Nanoscale Organization in Plants\nAuthors: Rohr, L.; Ehinger, A.; Rausch, L.; Burmeister, N. G.; Meixner, A. J.; Harter, K.; Kemmerling, B.; zur Oven-Krockhaus, S.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552827\nSuper-resolution microscopy provides deep insights into the dynamics of single membrane proteins and the nanoscale organization of plasma membrane proteins in living cells. However, in addition to plant-specific challenges in imaging applications, the elaborate analysis of single-molecule data complicates its widespread use in plant cell biological research. With GreenMemTraX, we provide a user-friendly, all-in-one, open-source software package that guides users through the steps of localization, tracking, mobility, and cluster analyses of plant plasma membrane proteins based on single particle tracking Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (sptPALM) data. GreenMemTraX dramatically simplifies data management following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and increases the ease of use and reproducibility of the evaluated results. In addition, batch processing with detailed parameter output is available for all analysis paths, maintaining the consistency of raw data with the calculated results. The applicability of GreenMemTraX is demonstrated by evaluating sptPALM data for two representative plant plasma membrane proteins, namely the brassinosteroid receptor Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1) and the Receptor-Like Protein 44 (RLP44). Both were tested with the photoconvertible or photoactivatable fluorophores mEos3.2, PA-GFP, and PATagRFP and expressed in the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression system and in stably transformed Arabidopsis thaliana plants. To facilitate plant applications, GreenMemTraX provides a number of preset parameter settings to address plant-specific obstacles.\nMultiple host targets of Pseudomonas effector protein HopM1 form a protein complex regulating apoplastic immunity and water homeostasis\nAuthors: He, S. Y.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551310\nBacterial type III effector proteins injected into the host cell play a critical role in mediating bacterial interactions with plant and animal hosts. Notably, some bacterial effectors are reported to target sequence-unrelated host proteins with unknown functional relationships. The Pseudomonas syringae effector HopM1 is such an example; it interacts with and/or degrades several HopM1-interacting (MIN) Arabidopsis proteins, including HopM1-interacting protein 2 (MIN2/RAD23), HopM1-interacting protein 7 (MIN7/BIG5), HopM1-interacting protein 10 (MIN10/14-3-3), and HopM1-interacting protein 13 (MIN13/BIG2). In this study, we purified the MIN7 complex formed in planta and found that it contains MIN7, MIN10, MIN13, as well as a tetratricopeptide repeat protein named HLB1. Mutational analysis showed that, like MIN7, HLB1 is required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-, effector-, and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-triggered immunity. HLB1 is recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) in a MIN7-dependent manner. Both min7 and hlb1 mutant leaves contained elevated water content in the leaf apoplast and artificial water infiltration into the leaf apoplast was sufficient to phenocopy immune-suppressing phenotype of HopM1. These results suggest that multiple HopM1-targeted MIN proteins form a protein complex with a dual role in modulating water level and immunity in the apoplast, which provides an explanation for the dual phenotypes of HopM1 during bacterial pathogenesis.\nSMB controls decompartmentalization in Arabidopsis root cap cells to execute programmed cell death\nAuthors: Wang, J.; BOLLIER, N.; Andrade Buono, R.; Vahldick, H.; Lin, Z.; Feng, Q.; Hudecek, R.; JIANG, Q.; Mylle, E.; Van Damme, D.; Nowack, M. K.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552584\nProgrammed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental cellular process crucial to development, homeostasis, and immunity in multicellular eukaryotes. In contrast to our knowledge on the regulation of diverse animal cell death subroutines, information on execution of PCD in plants remains fragmentary. Here we make use of the accessibility of the Arabidopsis thaliana root cap to visualize the execution process of developmentally controlled PCD. We identify a succession of selective decompartmentalization events and ion fluxes that are controlled by a gene regulatory network downstream of the NAC transcription factor SOMBRERO (SMB). Surprisingly, breakdown of the large central vacuole is a relatively late and variable event, preceded by an increase of intracellular calcium levels and acidification, release of mitochondrial matrix proteins, leakage of nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum lumina, and release of fluorescent membrane reporters into the cytosol. Elevated intracellular calcium levels and acidification are sufficient to trigger cell death execution specifically in cells that are rendered competent to undergo PCD by SMB activity, suggesting that these ion fluxes act as PCD-triggering signals.\nGOLDEN2-like1 is sufficient but not necessary for chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll cells of C4 grasses\nAuthors: Lambret Frotte, J.; Smith, G.; Langdale, J.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.10.528040\nChloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis. In land plants, chloroplast biogenesis is regulated by a family of transcription factors named GOLDEN2-like (GLK). In C4 grasses, it has been hypothesized that genome duplication events led to the sub-functionalization of GLK paralogs (GLK1 and GLK2) to control chloroplast biogenesis in two distinct cell types: mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Although previous characterization of golden2 (g2) mutants in maize has demonstrated a role for GLK2 paralogs in regulating chloroplast biogenesis in bundle sheath cells, the function of GLK1 has remained elusive. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, GLK1 is not required for chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll cells of maize. Comparisons between maize and Setaria viridis, which represent two independent C4 origins within the Poales, further show that the role of GLK paralogs in controlling chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells differs between species. Despite these differences, complementation analysis revealed that GLK1 and GLK2 genes from maize are both sufficient to restore functional chloroplast development in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of Setaria viridis mutants. Collectively our results suggest an evolutionary trajectory in C4 grasses whereby both orthologs retained the ability to induce chloroplast biogenesis but GLK2 adopted a more prominent developmental role, particularly in relation to chloroplast activation in bundle sheath cells.\nMetabolic arms race between a plant and a fungal pathogen\nAuthors: Liu, Y.; Mahdi, L.; Porzel, A.; Stark, P.; Esposto, D.; Scherr-Henning, A.; Bathe, U.; Acosta, I. F.; Zuccaro, A.; Balcke, G. U.; Tissier, A. F.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551000\nIn this work, we uncover a metabolite interaction between barley and the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (Bs), involving hordedanes, a previously undescribed set of labdane-related diterpenoids with antimicrobial properties. Bs infection of barley roots elicits hordedane synthesis from a 600-kb gene cluster. Heterologous reconstruction of the synthesis pathway in yeast produced several hordedanes, including one of the most advanced products 19-b-hydroxy-hordetrienoic acid (19-OH-HTA). Barley mutants in the diterpene synthase genes of the cluster are unable to produce hordedanes but, unexpectedly, show reduced Bs colonization. Accordingly, 19-OH-HTA enhances both germination and growth of Bs, while it inhibits other fungi, and Bs chemically modifies 19-OH-HTA. Thus, plant and pathogen molecular interactions extend beyond protein-protein recognition and the simple detoxification of plant antimicrobial metabolites. One-Sentence SummaryA fungal pathogen uses barley diterpenoid phytoalexins to facilitate root colonization.\nPectin methylesterase activity is required for RALF1 peptide signalling output\nAuthors: Roessling, A.-K.; Dunser, K.; Kalmbach, L.; Barbez, E.; Kleine-Vehn, J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553913\nThe extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular peptides largely remains unknown. RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Crop root systems are central to nutrition acquisition and water usage. Root hairs and lateral roots contribute to fine-scale patterning of root systems and can offer many advantages for improving root function without drastically impacting overall system architecture. Key genetic regulators underpinning root hair morphogenesis have been well characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis but are less understood in maize. Here, we identify a novel determinant of root hair morphogenesis and auxin responses in maize, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR27 (ARF27), using both reverse and quantitative genetic approaches. ARF27 is enriched in maize primary root tissues at both the transcript and protein level. Loss of ARF27 leads to short primary roots and reduced root hair formation, while lateral root density is unaltered. In arf27 roots, auxin-responsive gene expression is dysregulated, which is consistent with the predicted function of this transcription factor. Moreover, a genome wide association study (GWAS) to uncover genetic determinants of auxin-dependent root traits identified ARF27 as a candidate gene. Furthermore, auxin hypersensitive maize genotypes exhibit altered crown root length and surface area in field-grown plants. A gene regulatory network (GRN) was reconstructed and an ARF27 subnetwork was integrated with DAP-seq and GWAS data to identify ARF27 target genes. The ARF27 GRN includes known maize root development genes, such as ROOTLESS CONCERNING CROWN ROOTS (RTCS), ROOTHAIRLESS 3 (RTH3) and RTH6. Altogether this work identifies a novel genetic driver of auxin-mediated root morphogenesis in maize that can inform agricultural strategies for improved crop performance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chloroplast biogenesis is dependent on master regulators from the Golden2-like (GLK) family of transcription factors, but higher order glk mutants contain residual chlorophyll and therefore other proteins must also be involved. Here we identify MYB-related transcription factors as regulators of chloroplast biogenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana. In both species, double mutant alleles in MYB-Related genes show very limited chloroplast development and photosynthesis gene expression is perturbed to a greater extent than mutants of GLK. In M. polymorpha MYB-related genes act upstream of GLK, while in A. thaliana this relationship has been rewired. In both species, genes encoding enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis are controlled by both MYB-related and GLK proteins whilst those allowing CO2 fixation, photorespiration as well as photosystem assembly and repair require the MYB-related proteins. Thus, MYB-related and GLK genes have overlapping as well as distinct targets. We conclude that MYB-related transcription factors act with GLK to orchestrate chloroplast development in land plants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transcription factor WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 (WOX11) in Arabidopsis initiates the formation of adventitious lateral roots upon mechanical injury in primary roots. Root-invading nematodes also induce de novo root organogenesis leading to excessive root branching, but it is not known if this symptom of disease involves mediation by WOX11 and if it benefits the plant. Here, we show with targeted transcriptional repression and reporter gene analyses in Arabidopsis that the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii activates WOX11-adventitious lateral rooting from primary roots close to infection sites. The activation of WOX11 in nematode-infected roots occurs downstream of jasmonic acid-dependent damage signaling via ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR109, linking adventitious lateral root formation to nematode damage to host tissues. By measuring different root system components, we found that WOX11-mediated formation of adventitious lateral roots compensates for nematode-induced inhibition of primary root growth. Our observations further demonstrate that WOX11-mediated rooting reduces the impact of nematode infections on aboveground plant development and growth. Altogether, we conclude that the transcriptional regulation by WOX11 modulates root system plasticity under biotic stress, which is one of the key mechanisms underlying tolerance of Arabidopsis to cyst nematode infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In response to our ever-increasing demand for metals, phytotechnologies are being developed to limit the environmental impact of conventional metal mining. However, the development of these technologies, which rely on plant species able to tolerate and accumulate metals, is partly limited by our lack of knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

In this work, we aimed to identify genes involved in nickel hyperaccumulation in the Euphorbiaceae species Leucocroton havanensis. Using transcriptomic data, we identified two homologous genes, LhavIREG1 and LhavIREG2, encoding divalent metal transporters of the IREG/ferroportin family. Both genes are expressed at similar levels in shoots, but LhavIREG1 shows higher expression in roots. Heterologous expression of these transporters in A. thaliana revealed that LhavIREG1 is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas LhavIREG2 is located at the vacuole. In addition, expression of each gene induced a significant increase in nickel tolerance. Taken together, our data suggest that LhavIREG2 is involved in nickel sequestration in vacuoles of leaf cells, whereas LhavIREG1 is mainly involved in nickel translocation from roots to shoots, but could also be involved in metal sequestration in cell walls. Our results suggest that paralogous IREG/ferroportin transporters may play complementary roles in nickel hyperaccumulation in plants.

HighlightThe nickel hyperaccumulator Leucocroton havanensis endemic to Cuba, expresses two paralogous metal transporters of the IREG/ferroportin family that play distinct but complementary roles in nickel tolerance and accumulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Super-resolution microscopy provides deep insights into the dynamics of single membrane proteins and the nanoscale organization of plasma membrane proteins in living cells. However, in addition to plant-specific challenges in imaging applications, the elaborate analysis of single-molecule data complicates its widespread use in plant cell biological research. With GreenMemTraX, we provide a user-friendly, all-in-one, open-source software package that guides users through the steps of localization, tracking, mobility, and cluster analyses of plant plasma membrane proteins based on single particle tracking Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (sptPALM) data. GreenMemTraX dramatically simplifies data management following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and increases the ease of use and reproducibility of the evaluated results. In addition, batch processing with detailed parameter output is available for all analysis paths, maintaining the consistency of raw data with the calculated results. The applicability of GreenMemTraX is demonstrated by evaluating sptPALM data for two representative plant plasma membrane proteins, namely the brassinosteroid receptor Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1) and the Receptor-Like Protein 44 (RLP44). Both were tested with the photoconvertible or photoactivatable fluorophores mEos3.2, PA-GFP, and PATagRFP and expressed in the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression system and in stably transformed Arabidopsis thaliana plants. To facilitate plant applications, GreenMemTraX provides a number of preset parameter settings to address plant-specific obstacles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial type III effector proteins injected into the host cell play a critical role in mediating bacterial interactions with plant and animal hosts. Notably, some bacterial effectors are reported to target sequence-unrelated host proteins with unknown functional relationships. The Pseudomonas syringae effector HopM1 is such an example; it interacts with and/or degrades several HopM1-interacting (MIN) Arabidopsis proteins, including HopM1-interacting protein 2 (MIN2/RAD23), HopM1-interacting protein 7 (MIN7/BIG5), HopM1-interacting protein 10 (MIN10/14-3-3), and HopM1-interacting protein 13 (MIN13/BIG2). In this study, we purified the MIN7 complex formed in planta and found that it contains MIN7, MIN10, MIN13, as well as a tetratricopeptide repeat protein named HLB1. Mutational analysis showed that, like MIN7, HLB1 is required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-, effector-, and benzothiadiazole (BTH)-triggered immunity. HLB1 is recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) in a MIN7-dependent manner. Both min7 and hlb1 mutant leaves contained elevated water content in the leaf apoplast and artificial water infiltration into the leaf apoplast was sufficient to phenocopy immune-suppressing phenotype of HopM1. These results suggest that multiple HopM1-targeted MIN proteins form a protein complex with a dual role in modulating water level and immunity in the apoplast, which provides an explanation for the dual phenotypes of HopM1 during bacterial pathogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental cellular process crucial to development, homeostasis, and immunity in multicellular eukaryotes. In contrast to our knowledge on the regulation of diverse animal cell death subroutines, information on execution of PCD in plants remains fragmentary. Here we make use of the accessibility of the Arabidopsis thaliana root cap to visualize the execution process of developmentally controlled PCD. We identify a succession of selective decompartmentalization events and ion fluxes that are controlled by a gene regulatory network downstream of the NAC transcription factor SOMBRERO (SMB). Surprisingly, breakdown of the large central vacuole is a relatively late and variable event, preceded by an increase of intracellular calcium levels and acidification, release of mitochondrial matrix proteins, leakage of nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum lumina, and release of fluorescent membrane reporters into the cytosol. Elevated intracellular calcium levels and acidification are sufficient to trigger cell death execution specifically in cells that are rendered competent to undergo PCD by SMB activity, suggesting that these ion fluxes act as PCD-triggering signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis. In land plants, chloroplast biogenesis is regulated by a family of transcription factors named GOLDEN2-like (GLK). In C4 grasses, it has been hypothesized that genome duplication events led to the sub-functionalization of GLK paralogs (GLK1 and GLK2) to control chloroplast biogenesis in two distinct cell types: mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Although previous characterization of golden2 (g2) mutants in maize has demonstrated a role for GLK2 paralogs in regulating chloroplast biogenesis in bundle sheath cells, the function of GLK1 has remained elusive. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, GLK1 is not required for chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll cells of maize. Comparisons between maize and Setaria viridis, which represent two independent C4 origins within the Poales, further show that the role of GLK paralogs in controlling chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells differs between species. Despite these differences, complementation analysis revealed that GLK1 and GLK2 genes from maize are both sufficient to restore functional chloroplast development in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of Setaria viridis mutants. Collectively our results suggest an evolutionary trajectory in C4 grasses whereby both orthologs retained the ability to induce chloroplast biogenesis but GLK2 adopted a more prominent developmental role, particularly in relation to chloroplast activation in bundle sheath cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this work, we uncover a metabolite interaction between barley and the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (Bs), involving hordedanes, a previously undescribed set of labdane-related diterpenoids with antimicrobial properties. Bs infection of barley roots elicits hordedane synthesis from a 600-kb gene cluster. Heterologous reconstruction of the synthesis pathway in yeast produced several hordedanes, including one of the most advanced products 19-b-hydroxy-hordetrienoic acid (19-OH-HTA). Barley mutants in the diterpene synthase genes of the cluster are unable to produce hordedanes but, unexpectedly, show reduced Bs colonization. Accordingly, 19-OH-HTA enhances both germination and growth of Bs, while it inhibits other fungi, and Bs chemically modifies 19-OH-HTA. Thus, plant and pathogen molecular interactions extend beyond protein-protein recognition and the simple detoxification of plant antimicrobial metabolites.

One-Sentence SummaryA fungal pathogen uses barley diterpenoid phytoalexins to facilitate root colonization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular peptides largely remains unknown. RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.</p>
