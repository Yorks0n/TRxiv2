Providing resources from Earth is not cost-efficient, and resupply missions are not viable to meet the needs of long-term life in deep space conditions. Plants in space can provide a source of nutrition and oxygen, reducing the reliance on packaged foods, reducing resupply needs, and extending the duration of missions. Using lunar regolith simulant, we employ a novel methodology to create a sustainable and productive growth medium to support the cultivation of horticultural crops on the Moon. Implementing microbial soil regeneration mechanisms derived from Earth, we leverage the interaction between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Vermicompost (VC) to create a fertile LRS matrix. These amendments can sequester toxic contaminants, improve soil structure, and increase plant stress tolerance. We demonstrate the ability to produce chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in lunar regolith simulant augmented with AMF and VC under climate-controlled conditions. We cultivated chickpea to seed in a mixture containing 75% Lunar Regolith Simulant. Preliminary results suggest that higher LRS contents induce heightened stress responses. However, plants grown in 100% LRS inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated an average two-week survival extension compared to non-inoculated plants. This study provides, for the first time, a baseline for chickpea germination in varying mixtures of LRS and VC and will inform future studies as humanity goes back to the Moon.\nModular mechanisms of immune priming and growth inhibition mediated by plant effector-triggered immunity\nAuthors: Chhillar, H.; Yeh, P.-M.; Nguyen, H. H.; Jones, J. D.; Ding, P.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578334\nExcessive activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants inhibits plant growth and activates cell death. ETI mediated by intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor/Resistance protein (TIR) nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs) involves two partially redundant signalling nodes in Arabidopsis, EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 and EDS1-SAG101-NRG1. Genetic and transcriptomic analyses show that EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 primarily enhances the immune component abundance and is critical for limiting pathogen growth, whereas EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 mainly activates the hypersensitive cell death response (HR) but is dispensable for immune priming. This study enhances our understanding of the distinct contributions of these two signalling modules to ETI and suggests potential strategies for improving disease resistance in crops without compromising yield.\nA shade-responsive microProtein in the Arabidopsis ATHB2 gene regulates elongation growth and root development\nAuthors: Edwards, A. K.; Chiurazzi, M. J.; Blaakmeer, A.; Vittozzi, Y.; Sharma, A.; Matton, S.; Kruusvee, V.; Straub, D.; Sessa, G.; Carabelli, M.; Morelli, G.; Wenkel, S.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578400\nThe ability of plants to thrive under suboptimal light conditions, such as shade, is crucial for their overall survival and reproductive success. Here, we show that Arabidopsis seedlings produce a large number of alternative transcripts when exposed to shade. Notably, one of the identified transcript candidates, which was upregulated in shade conditions, was found to be an alternative transcript of the ATHB2 gene. ATHB2 belongs to the HD-ZIPII class of transcription factors and is a well-established regulator of the shade avoidance response. The function of the alternative transcript and the small leucine zipper protein encoded by it, ATHB2miP, was investigated. We found that ATHB2miP is primarily expressed in the shoot meristem and interacts with full-length ATHB2 protein to inhibit its activity through a negative feedback mechanism. Deletion of the genomic region encoding the leucine zipper domain of the ATHB2 gene using CRISPR, resulted in plants exhibiting altered shade avoidance responses and root development. We show that the leucine zipper domain is required for dimerising and localising to nuclear photobodies. There is a significant overlap in deregulated genes between plants ectopically expressing ATHB2miP and athb2 mutant plants. The analysis of gene ontology and clustering revealed that the most affected processes are auxin synthesis and signaling, root development, and iron homeostasis. Shade growth experiments at different iron concentrations revealed a role for ATHB2 in regulating iron uptake and showed that iron availability affects shade growth in an ATHB2-dependent manner. This study identifies ATHB2miP as a novel regulator of shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis, highlighting the intricate transcriptional regulation underlying these processes.\nThe endophytic fungus Serendipita indica alters auxin distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana roots through alteration of auxin transport and conjugation to promote plant growth\nAuthors: Gonzalez Ortega-Villaizan, A.; King, E.; Patel, M. K.; PEREZ ALONSO, M. M.; Scholz, S. S.; Sakakibara, H.; Kiba, T.; Kojima, M.; Takebayashi, Y.; Ramos, P.; Morales-Quintana, L.; Breitenbach, S.; Smolko, A.; Salopek-Sondi, B.; Bauer, N.; Müller-Ludwig, J.; Krapp, A.; Oelmüller, R.; Vicente-Carbajosa, J.; Pollmann, S.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576781\nPlants share their habitats with a multitude of different microbes. This close vicinity promoted the evolution of inter-organismic interactions between plants and many different microorganisms that provide mutual growth benefits both to the plant and the microbial partner. The symbiosis of Arabidopsis thaliana with the beneficial root colonizing endophyte Serendipita indica represents a well-studied system. Co-colonization of Arabidopsis roots with S. indica significantly promotes plant growth. Due to the notable phenotypic alterations of fungus-infected root systems, the involvement of a reprogramming of plant hormone levels, especially that of indole-3-acetic acid, has been suggested earlier. However, until now, the molecular mechanism by which S. indica promotes plant growth remains largely unknown. This study used comprehensive transcriptomics, metabolomics, reverse genetics, and life cell imaging to reveal the intricacies of auxin-related processes that affect root growth in the symbiosis between A. thaliana and S. indica. Our experiments revealed the essential role of tightly controlled auxin conjugation in the plant-fungus interaction. It particularly highlighted the importance of two GRETCHEN HAGEN 3 (GH3) genes, GH3.5 and GH3.17, for the fungus infection-triggered stimulation of biomass production, thus broadening our knowledge about the function of GH3s in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the transcriptional alteration of the PIN2 auxin transporter gene in roots of Arabidopsis seedlings infected with S. indica and demonstrate that this transcriptional adjustment affects auxin signaling in roots, which results in increased plant growth.\nMorphological and genetic analysis of inflorescence and flower development in hemp (Cannabis sativa L.)\nAuthors: Shi, J.; Schilling, S.; Melzer, R.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577276\nHemp (Cannabis sativa) is one of the oldest cultivated crops, and its myriad of uses have fascinated humans for millennia. In contemporary agriculture, the seeds are used for high-quality oil, human food, and nutritional supplements. From female inflorescences, secondary compounds (cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids) are isolated that are implicated to have a wide range of medicinal applications. These elements provide hemp with significant market and research value and emphasise the need to thoroughly understand reproductive development in hemp. Here, we present a detailed morphological and molecular analysis of hemp inflorescence and flower development of the cultivar FINOLA. Hemp is unusual among flowering plants as it is dioecious, i.e. develops male and female plants. We define eight landmark events in male and female flower development and show that developmental differences between male and female plants extend beyond floral morphology, additionally comprising inflorescence structure as well as flowering time. Further, we demonstrate that the time of activation of key reproductive developmental regulators is significantly different in male and female hemp plants. Our comparison of male and female hemp plants shows that developmental pathways diverge very early, already at the two-leaf stage, laying a basis for further exploration into the genetics of sex determination of C. sativa.\nAmphicarpic development in the emerging model organism Cardamine chenopodiifolia\nAuthors: Emonet, A.; Perez-Anton, M.; Neumann, U.; Dunemann, S.; Huettel, B.; Koller, R.; Hay, A.\nScore: 12.7, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577352\nO_LIAmphicarpy is an unusual trait where two fruit types develop: one above and the other below ground. This trait is not found in conventional model species, therefore, its development and molecular genetics remain under-studied. Here, we establish Cardamine chenopodiifolia as an emerging experimental system to study amphicarpy. C_LIO_LIWe characterized the development of C. chenopodiifolia, focusing on differences in morphology and cell wall histochemistry between above- and below-ground fruit. We generated a reference transcriptome using PacBio full-length transcript sequencing (IsoSeq) and used a combination of short and long read sequencing to analyse differential gene expression between above- and below-ground fruit valves. C_LIO_LIC. chenopodiifolia has two contrasting modes of seed dispersal. The main shoot fails to bolt and initiates floral primordia that bury underground where they self-pollinate and set seed. By contrast, axillary shoots bolt to position flowers and exploding seed pods above ground. Morphological differences between aerial explosive fruit and subterranean non-explosive fruit were reflected in a large number of differentially regulated genes involved in photosynthesis, secondary cell wall formation and defence responses. C_LIO_LITools established in C. chenopodiifolia, such as a reference transcriptome, draft genome assembly and stable plant transformation, pave the way to explore under-studied traits and discover new biological mechanisms. C_LI\nGeometry and cell wall mechanics guide early pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Riglet, L.; Quilliet, C.; Godin, C.; John, K.; Fobis-Loisy, I.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578915\nIn Arabidopsis thaliana, successful fertilization relies on the precise guidance of the pollen tube tip as it navigates through the female pistil tissues to deliver non-motile sperm cells to ovules. While prior studies have unveiled the role of the pistil in directing pollen tubes to ovules, growth guidance mechanisms within the stigmatic epidermis during the initial phase of the pollen tube journey remains elusive. A recent analysis comparing wild-type (WT) pollen tube paths in WT and ktn1-5 stigmatic cells revealed a tight connection between directed pollen tube growth and the mechanical properties of the invaded stigmatic cell. Building upon these observations, we constructed here a mathematical model to explore the mechanisms guiding early pollen tube growth through the papilla cell wall (CW). We found that in ktn1-5, the pollen tube moves freely on the curved papilla surface, following geodesics, while the WT papilla exerts directional guidance on the pollen tube. An order of magnitude analysis of the mechanical forces involved in pollen tube growth in papillae suggests a guidance mechanism, where the elongated papilla geometry and the CW elasticity combine to efficiently direct pollen tube growth towards the papilla base.\nThe molecular core of transcriptome responses to abiotic stress in plants: a machine learning-driven meta-analysis\nAuthors: Sanchez-Munoz, R.; Depaepe, T.; Samalova, M.; Hejatko, J.; Zaplana, I.; Van Der Straeten, D.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576978\nUnderstanding how plants adapt their physiology to overcome severe stress conditions is vital in light of the current climate crisis. This remains a challenge given the complex nature of the underlying molecular mechanisms. To provide a full picture of stress mitigation mechanisms, an exhaustive analysis of publicly available stress-related transcriptomic data was conducted. We combined a meta-analysis with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify a core of stress-related genes. To ensure robustness and biological significance of the output, often lacking in meta-analyses, a three-layered biovalidation was incorporated. Our results present a stress gene core, a set of key genes involved in plant tolerance to a multitude of adverse environmental conditions rather than specific ones. In addition, we provide a biologically validated database to assist in design of multi-stress resilience. Taken together, our results pave the way towards future-proof sustainable agriculture. TeaserUsing a machine learning-driven meta-analysis, a plant stress gene core was identified as a hub mediating multi-stress regulation\nLarge-scale multi-omics analyses identified root-microbiome associations underlying plant nitrogen nutrition\nAuthors: Li, N.; Li, G.; Wang, D.; Ma, L.; Huang, X.; Bai, Z.; Wang, Y.; Luo, M.; Luo, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Cao, X.; Feng, Q.; Xu, Y.; Mu, J.; An, R.; Yang, C.; Chen, H.; Li, X.; Dong, Y.; Zhao, J.; Jiang, L.; Jiang, Y.; Reif, J. C.; Hochholdinger, F.; Chen, X.; Wang, D.; Zhang, Y.; Bai, Y.; Yu, P.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578621\nThe microbiome determines the performance and fitness of the host plant. Nevertheless, the causal interaction between host genetic variation, gene regulation and the impact of the microbiome on the host phenotype remain unknown. Here we generated 1,341 paired root transcriptome, rhizosphere microbiome and root ionome samples and performed a multi-omics analyses of the host-microbe association at the root-soil interface using 175 rapeseeds (Brassica napus L.) resequenced ecotypes at two field environments. We observed the highest statistically explained variance for root nitrogen uptake among natural ionomic variation by overall transcriptome-wide gene expression and microbial abundance variation. Moreover, we identified significant genome-wide associations for 203 highly heritable amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at multiple genetic loci regulated by eQTL hotspots associated with nitrogen metabolism components. These associations involved a central bacterial genus (Sphingopyxis), which plays a dominant role on gene regulatory effect on its variation regulated by eQTL hotspots. In addition, we performed high-throughput bacterial cultivation from rapeseed roots and subjected Sphingopyxis to whole genome sequencing. Finally, targeted metabolite profiling and confocal imaging assays demonstrated a host-microbiome regulatory effect on Sphingopyxis established by lateral root development and plant nitrogen nutrition. In summary, our integrative approach reveals the genetic basis of host-microbiome trait associations in the transcriptional, nutritional and environmental domains and suggests that the microbiome might have causal effects on root development with implications towards the breeding of nutrient-efficient crops.\nPlant response to intermittent heat stress involves modulation of mRNA translation efficiency\nAuthors: Dannfald, A.; Carpentier, M.-C.; Merret, R.; Favory, J.-J.; Deragon, J.-M.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.576986\nAcquired thermotolerance (also known as priming) is the ability of cells or organisms to better survive an acute heat stress if it is preceded by a milder one. In plants, acquired thermotolerance has been studied mainly at the transcriptional level, including recent descriptions of sophisticated regulatory circuits that are essential for this learning capacity. In this work, we tested the involvement of polysome-related processes (translation and cotranslational mRNA decay (CTRD)) in plant thermotolerance using two heat stress regimes with and without a priming event. We found that priming is essential to restore the general translational potential of plants shortly after acute heat stress. We observed that mRNAs not involved in heat stress suffer from a reduction in translation efficiency at high temperature, whereas heat stress-related mRNAs are translated more efficiently under the same condition. We also show that the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in acute heat stress is favoured by a previous priming event and that, in the absence of priming, ER-translated mRNAs become preferential targets of CTRD. Finally, we present evidence that CTRD can specifically regulate more than a thousand genes during heat stress and should be considered as an independent gene regulatory mechanism.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Food sustainability is one of the most significant barriers to long-term space travel. Providing resources from Earth is not cost-efficient, and resupply missions are not viable to meet the needs of long-term life in deep space conditions. Plants in space can provide a source of nutrition and oxygen, reducing the reliance on packaged foods, reducing resupply needs, and extending the duration of missions. Using lunar regolith simulant, we employ a novel methodology to create a sustainable and productive growth medium to support the cultivation of horticultural crops on the Moon. Implementing microbial soil regeneration mechanisms derived from Earth, we leverage the interaction between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Vermicompost (VC) to create a fertile LRS matrix. These amendments can sequester toxic contaminants, improve soil structure, and increase plant stress tolerance. We demonstrate the ability to produce chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in lunar regolith simulant augmented with AMF and VC under climate-controlled conditions. We cultivated chickpea to seed in a mixture containing 75% Lunar Regolith Simulant. Preliminary results suggest that higher LRS contents induce heightened stress responses. However, plants grown in 100% LRS inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi demonstrated an average two-week survival extension compared to non-inoculated plants. This study provides, for the first time, a baseline for chickpea germination in varying mixtures of LRS and VC and will inform future studies as humanity goes back to the Moon.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Excessive activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants inhibits plant growth and activates cell death. ETI mediated by intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor/Resistance protein (TIR) nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs) involves two partially redundant signalling nodes in Arabidopsis, EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 and EDS1-SAG101-NRG1. Genetic and transcriptomic analyses show that EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 primarily enhances the immune component abundance and is critical for limiting pathogen growth, whereas EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 mainly activates the hypersensitive cell death response (HR) but is dispensable for immune priming. This study enhances our understanding of the distinct contributions of these two signalling modules to ETI and suggests potential strategies for improving disease resistance in crops without compromising yield.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of plants to thrive under suboptimal light conditions, such as shade, is crucial for their overall survival and reproductive success. Here, we show that Arabidopsis seedlings produce a large number of alternative transcripts when exposed to shade. Notably, one of the identified transcript candidates, which was upregulated in shade conditions, was found to be an alternative transcript of the ATHB2 gene. ATHB2 belongs to the HD-ZIPII class of transcription factors and is a well-established regulator of the shade avoidance response. The function of the alternative transcript and the small leucine zipper protein encoded by it, ATHB2miP, was investigated. We found that ATHB2miP is primarily expressed in the shoot meristem and interacts with full-length ATHB2 protein to inhibit its activity through a negative feedback mechanism. Deletion of the genomic region encoding the leucine zipper domain of the ATHB2 gene using CRISPR, resulted in plants exhibiting altered shade avoidance responses and root development. We show that the leucine zipper domain is required for dimerising and localising to nuclear photobodies. There is a significant overlap in deregulated genes between plants ectopically expressing ATHB2miP and athb2 mutant plants. The analysis of gene ontology and clustering revealed that the most affected processes are auxin synthesis and signaling, root development, and iron homeostasis. Shade growth experiments at different iron concentrations revealed a role for ATHB2 in regulating iron uptake and showed that iron availability affects shade growth in an ATHB2-dependent manner. This study identifies ATHB2miP as a novel regulator of shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis, highlighting the intricate transcriptional regulation underlying these processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants share their habitats with a multitude of different microbes. This close vicinity promoted the evolution of inter-organismic interactions between plants and many different microorganisms that provide mutual growth benefits both to the plant and the microbial partner. The symbiosis of Arabidopsis thaliana with the beneficial root colonizing endophyte Serendipita indica represents a well-studied system. Co-colonization of Arabidopsis roots with S. indica significantly promotes plant growth. Due to the notable phenotypic alterations of fungus-infected root systems, the involvement of a reprogramming of plant hormone levels, especially that of indole-3-acetic acid, has been suggested earlier. However, until now, the molecular mechanism by which S. indica promotes plant growth remains largely unknown. This study used comprehensive transcriptomics, metabolomics, reverse genetics, and life cell imaging to reveal the intricacies of auxin-related processes that affect root growth in the symbiosis between A. thaliana and S. indica. Our experiments revealed the essential role of tightly controlled auxin conjugation in the plant-fungus interaction. It particularly highlighted the importance of two GRETCHEN HAGEN 3 (GH3) genes, GH3.5 and GH3.17, for the fungus infection-triggered stimulation of biomass production, thus broadening our knowledge about the function of GH3s in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the transcriptional alteration of the PIN2 auxin transporter gene in roots of Arabidopsis seedlings infected with S. indica and demonstrate that this transcriptional adjustment affects auxin signaling in roots, which results in increased plant growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is one of the oldest cultivated crops, and its myriad of uses have fascinated humans for millennia. In contemporary agriculture, the seeds are used for high-quality oil, human food, and nutritional supplements. From female inflorescences, secondary compounds (cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids) are isolated that are implicated to have a wide range of medicinal applications. These elements provide hemp with significant market and research value and emphasise the need to thoroughly understand reproductive development in hemp.

Here, we present a detailed morphological and molecular analysis of hemp inflorescence and flower development of the cultivar  FINOLA. Hemp is unusual among flowering plants as it is dioecious, i.e. develops male and female plants. We define eight landmark events in male and female flower development and show that developmental differences between male and female plants extend beyond floral morphology, additionally comprising inflorescence structure as well as flowering time. Further, we demonstrate that the time of activation of key reproductive developmental regulators is significantly different in male and female hemp plants. Our comparison of male and female hemp plants shows that developmental pathways diverge very early, already at the two-leaf stage, laying a basis for further exploration into the genetics of sex determination of C. sativa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIAmphicarpy is an unusual trait where two fruit types develop: one above and the other below ground. This trait is not found in conventional model species, therefore, its development and molecular genetics remain under-studied. Here, we establish Cardamine chenopodiifolia as an emerging experimental system to study amphicarpy.
C_LIO_LIWe characterized the development of C. chenopodiifolia, focusing on differences in morphology and cell wall histochemistry between above- and below-ground fruit. We generated a reference transcriptome using PacBio full-length transcript sequencing (IsoSeq) and used a combination of short and long read sequencing to analyse differential gene expression between above- and below-ground fruit valves.
C_LIO_LIC. chenopodiifolia has two contrasting modes of seed dispersal. The main shoot fails to bolt and initiates floral primordia that bury underground where they self-pollinate and set seed. By contrast, axillary shoots bolt to position flowers and exploding seed pods above ground. Morphological differences between aerial explosive fruit and subterranean non-explosive fruit were reflected in a large number of differentially regulated genes involved in photosynthesis, secondary cell wall formation and defence responses.
C_LIO_LITools established in C. chenopodiifolia, such as a reference transcriptome, draft genome assembly and stable plant transformation, pave the way to explore under-studied traits and discover new biological mechanisms.

        <p class="abstract">In Arabidopsis thaliana, successful fertilization relies on the precise guidance of the pollen tube tip as it navigates through the female pistil tissues to deliver non-motile sperm cells to ovules. While prior studies have unveiled the role of the pistil in directing pollen tubes to ovules, growth guidance mechanisms within the stigmatic epidermis during the initial phase of the pollen tube journey remains elusive. A recent analysis comparing wild-type (WT) pollen tube paths in WT and ktn1-5 stigmatic cells revealed a tight connection between directed pollen tube growth and the mechanical properties of the invaded stigmatic cell. Building upon these observations, we constructed here a mathematical model to explore the mechanisms guiding early pollen tube growth through the papilla cell wall (CW). We found that in ktn1-5, the pollen tube moves freely on the curved papilla surface, following geodesics, while the WT papilla exerts directional guidance on the pollen tube. An order of magnitude analysis of the mechanical forces involved in pollen tube growth in papillae suggests a guidance mechanism, where the elongated papilla geometry and the CW elasticity combine to efficiently direct pollen tube growth towards the papilla base.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how plants adapt their physiology to overcome severe stress conditions is vital in light of the current climate crisis. This remains a challenge given the complex nature of the underlying molecular mechanisms. To provide a full picture of stress mitigation mechanisms, an exhaustive analysis of publicly available stress-related transcriptomic data was conducted. We combined a meta-analysis with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify a core of stress-related genes. To ensure robustness and biological significance of the output, often lacking in meta-analyses, a three-layered biovalidation was incorporated. Our results present a  stress gene core, a set of key genes involved in plant tolerance to a multitude of adverse environmental conditions rather than specific ones. In addition, we provide a biologically validated database to assist in design of multi-stress resilience. Taken together, our results pave the way towards future-proof sustainable agriculture.

TeaserUsing a machine learning-driven meta-analysis, a plant  stress gene core was identified as a hub mediating multi-stress regulation</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microbiome determines the performance and fitness of the host plant. Nevertheless, the causal interaction between host genetic variation, gene regulation and the impact of the microbiome on the host phenotype remain unknown. Here we generated 1,341 paired root transcriptome, rhizosphere microbiome and root ionome samples and performed a multi-omics analyses of the host-microbe association at the root-soil interface using 175 rapeseeds (Brassica napus L.) resequenced ecotypes at two field environments. We observed the highest statistically explained variance for root nitrogen uptake among natural ionomic variation by overall transcriptome-wide gene expression and microbial abundance variation. Moreover, we identified significant genome-wide associations for 203 highly heritable amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at multiple genetic loci regulated by eQTL hotspots associated with nitrogen metabolism components. These associations involved a central bacterial genus (Sphingopyxis), which plays a dominant role on gene regulatory effect on its variation regulated by eQTL hotspots. In addition, we performed high-throughput bacterial cultivation from rapeseed roots and subjected Sphingopyxis to whole genome sequencing. Finally, targeted metabolite profiling and confocal imaging assays demonstrated a host-microbiome regulatory effect on Sphingopyxis established by lateral root development and plant nitrogen nutrition. In summary, our integrative approach reveals the genetic basis of host-microbiome trait associations in the transcriptional, nutritional and environmental domains and suggests that the microbiome might have causal effects on root development with implications towards the breeding of nutrient-efficient crops.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acquired thermotolerance (also known as priming) is the ability of cells or organisms to better survive an acute heat stress if it is preceded by a milder one. In plants, acquired thermotolerance has been studied mainly at the transcriptional level, including recent descriptions of sophisticated regulatory circuits that are essential for this learning capacity. In this work, we tested the involvement of polysome-related processes (translation and cotranslational mRNA decay (CTRD)) in plant thermotolerance using two heat stress regimes with and without a priming event. We found that priming is essential to restore the general translational potential of plants shortly after acute heat stress. We observed that mRNAs not involved in heat stress suffer from a reduction in translation efficiency at high temperature, whereas heat stress-related mRNAs are translated more efficiently under the same condition. We also show that the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in acute heat stress is favoured by a previous priming event and that, in the absence of priming, ER-translated mRNAs become preferential targets of CTRD. Finally, we present evidence that CTRD can specifically regulate more than a thousand genes during heat stress and should be considered as an independent gene regulatory mechanism.</p>
