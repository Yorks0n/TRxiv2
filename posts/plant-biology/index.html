D.\nScore: 67.5, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560457\nScientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields. Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.\nPuzzle cell shape emerges from the interaction of growth with mechanical constraints\nAuthors: Trozzi, N.; Lane, B.; Perruchoud, A.; Wang, Y.; Hoermayer, L.; Ansel, M.; Mollier, C.; Malivert, A.; Clark, F.; Reichgelt, T.; Roeder, A. H. K.; Hamant, O.; Boudaoud, A.; Kwiatkowska, D.; Runions, A.; Smith, R. S.; Majda, M.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560343\nThe puzzle-shaped cells found in the shoot epidermis of many plant species are a fascinating example of complex cell shapes. Because biological form often follows function, the unique shape of these cells suggests that they must serve some adaptive purpose for the plant. We previously proposed that these intricate shapes provide an effective strategy for reducing mechanical stress on the cell wall when epidermal cells undergo growth in more than one direction. Here we analyze a large selection of living and paleo plant species and find that the ability to make puzzle cells is a shared feature across all plant species, although their presence can be hidden as it varies depending on the organ, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. Computational modeling of Arabidopsis and maize epidermal cells revealed that presence and patterning of lobes is a dynamic process that is intricately linked to the growth history and environmental context of the plant organ. Conversely, disrupted lobeyness in mutants or with drug treatments affects plant development and leads to compensatory strategies. We propose that the mechanism underlying the formation of puzzle-shaped cells is likely conserved among higher plants and is a response to a developmental constraint driven by growth and mechanical stress.\nTransposon-triggered epigenetic chromatin dynamics modulate EFR-related pathogen response\nAuthors: Mencia, R.; Arce, A. L.; Houriet, C.; Xian, W.; Contreras, A.; Shirsekar, G.; Weigel, D.; Manavella, P. A.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561201\nInfectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive \"EFR-open\" chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.\nPlant diversity darkspots for global collection priorities\nAuthors: Ondo, I.; Dhanjal-Adams, K.; Pironon, S.; Silvestro, D.; Deklerck, V.; Grace, O.; Monro, A. K.; Nicolson, N.; Walker, B.; Antonelli, A.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557387\nO_LIMore than 15% of all vascular plant species may remain scientifically undescribed, and many of the \u003e340,000 described species have no or few geographic records documenting their distribution. Identifying and understanding taxonomic and geographic knowledge shortfalls is key to prioritising future collection and conservation efforts. C_LIO_LIUsing extensive data for 343,754 vascular plant species and time-to-event analyses, we conducted multiple tests related to plant taxonomic and geographic data shortfalls, and identified 29 global diversity darkspots (regions expected to lack most information about their species diversity and distribution by 2050). We defined priority regions for future collection according to several socio-economic and environmental scenarios. C_LIO_LIOur understanding of the global diversity and distribution of vascular plant species is estimated to remain incomplete and biased by 2050 under current collection patterns. Most plant diversity darkspots are found within biodiversity hotspots, except New Guinea. We identify the Philippines, Myanmar, Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, Iran, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru, as global collection priorities under all environmental and socio-economic conditions considered. C_LIO_LIOur study provides a framework to accelerate plant species documentation for the implementation of conservation actions. As digitisation of the worlds herbaria progresses, collection and conservation priorities may soon be identifiable at finer scales.

P.; Mehta, P.; Halvorson, Z.; zhang, L.; Matias, G. F.; Brent, L.; Faizi, K.; Goulding, C.; Busch, W.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.16.516796\nPlants are sessile organisms that constantly adapt to their changing environment. The root is exposed to numerous environmental signals ranging from nutrients and water to microbial molecular patterns. These signals can trigger distinct responses including the rapid increase or decrease of root growth. Consequently, using root growth as a readout for signal perception can help decipher which external cues are perceived by roots, and how these signals are integrated. To date, studies measuring root growth responses using large numbers of roots have been limited by a lack of high-throughput image acquisition, poor scalability of analytical methods, or low spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed the Root Walker pipeline, which uses automated microscopes to acquire time-series images of many roots exposed to controlled treatments with high-spatiotemporal-resolution, in conjunction with fast and automated image analysis software. We demonstrate the power of Root Walker by quantifying root growth rate responses at different time and throughput scales upon treatments with natural auxin, and upon treatment with two mitogen-associated protein kinase cascade inhibitors. We find a concentration-dependent root growth response to auxin and reveal the specificity of one MAPK inhibitor. We further demonstrate the ability of Root Walker for conducting genetic screens by performing a genome wide association study on 260 accessions under 2 weeks. This revealed known and unknown root growth regulators. Root Walker promises to be a useful toolkit for the plant science community, allowing large-scale screening of root growth dynamics for a variety of purposes, including genetic screens for root sensing and root growth response mechanisms.\nNitric Oxide controls shoot meristem activity via regulation of DNA methylation\nAuthors: Zeng, J.; Zhao, X.; Liang, Z.; Hidalgo, I.; Gebert, M.; Fan, P.; Wenzl, C.; Gornik, S. G.; Lohmann, J. U.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561157\nDespite the importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) as signaling molecule in both plant and animal development1-7, the regulatory mechanisms downstream of NO remain largely unclear. Here, we show that NO is involved in Arabidopsis shoot stem cell control via modifying expression and activity of ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a core component of the RNA directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway. Mutations in components of the RdDM pathway cause meristematic defects, and reduce responses of the stem cell system to NO signaling. Importantly, we found that the stem cell inducing WUSCHEL transcription factor directly interacts with AGO4 in an NO dependent manner, explaining how these two signaling systems may converge to modify DNA methylation patterns. Taken together, our results reveal that NO signaling plays an important role in controlling plant stem cell homeostasis via the regulation of de novo DNA methylation.\nGrove-level analysis of titer and prevalence of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and Wolbachia in Diaphorina citri, vector of citrus Huanglongbing\nAuthors: Mann, M.; Thompson, L.; Johnson, L.; Heck, M. L.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560920\nHuanglongbing (HLB, or citrus greening disease) affects all citrus varieties world-wide. In the USA, Asia, and South America the causal agent is \"Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus\" (CLas), a phloem-limited, uncultured, alphaproteobacterium. The hemipteran insect vector, Diaphorina citri (Asian citrus psyllid) acquires and transmits CLas in a circulative, propagative manner. In addition to CLas, D. citri hosts multiple symbiotic bacteria including Wolbachia (wDi). In D. citri, wDi has been sequenced and studied but specific roles in D. citri biology are unknown. Using well established quantitative PCR methods we measured CLas titer in D. citri collected from four groves in central Florida with distinct HLB management strategies and tested whether CLas and wDi titer were correlated in a sub-set of these insects. Grove site had the largest effect on CLas titer. Sex had no effect on CLas titer, while higher wDi titer was correlated with CLas-uninfected insects. Our results suggest that more directed follow-up research is necessary and important to clarify whether field management tactics influence CLas titer in D. citri and to better understand gene-by-environment interactions among D. citri, wDi and CLas. Now that millions of trees in Florida have been treated with injectable formulations of oxytetracycline, which is likely to decrease bacterial populations in D. citri, this study may represent the last biologically meaningful snapshot of grove-level vector-pathogen ecology in the state during the HLB epidemic.\nMechanotransduction in Lateral Root Initiation: A Model Integrating Growth Mechanics and Auxin Signaling\nAuthors: Ramos, J. R. D.; Reyes-Hernandez, B. J.; Alim, K.; Maizel, A.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558377\nPlant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth, which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots, pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between auxin, growth, and the resolution of mechanical conflicts. However, the exact mechanisms by which this coordination is achieved are still unknown. Here, we propose a model that integrates tissue mechanics and auxin transport, revealing a connection between the auxin-induced relaxation of mechanical stress in the pericycle and auxin signalling in the endodermis. We show that the growth of pericycle cells is initially limited by the endodermis, resulting in a modest initial growth. However, this modest growth is sufficient to redirect auxin to the overlying endodermis, which then actively accommodates the growth, allowing for the subsequent development of the lateral root. Our model uncovers the mechanical parameters that underlie endodermal accommodation and how the structure and shape of the endodermis influence the formation of the new root. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between mechanics and auxin flow during lateral root initiation, emphasizing the vital role of the endodermis in shaping root development through mechanotransduction and auxin signalling.\nHigh intraspecies allelic diversity in Arabidopsis NLR immune receptors is associated with distinct genomic and epigenomic features\nAuthors: Sutherland, C. A.; Prigozhin, D. M.; Monroe, J. G.; Krasileva, K. V.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.12.523861\nPlants rely on Nucleotide-binding, Leucine-rich repeat Receptors (NLRs) for pathogen recognition. Highly variable NLRs (hvNLRs) show remarkable intraspecies diversity, while their low variability paralogs (non-hvNLRs) are conserved between ecotypes. At a population level, hvNLRs provide new pathogen recognition specificities, but the association between allelic diversity and genomic and epigenomic features has not been established. Our investigation of NLRs in Arabidopsis Col-0 has revealed that hvNLRs show higher expression, less gene body cytosine methylation, and closer proximity to transposable elements than non-hvNLRs. hvNLRs show elevated synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity and are in chromatin states associated with an increased probability of mutation. Diversifying selection maintains variability at a subset of codons of hvNLRs, while purifying selection maintains conservation at non-hvNLRs. How these features are established and maintained, and whether they contribute to the observed diversity of hvNLRs is key to understanding the evolution of plant innate immune receptors.\nPhotosynthesis is led by stomatal circadian rhythm and not by starch depletion after a long period of darkness\nAuthors: Dresch, C.; Vidal, V.; Suchail, S.; Sallanon, H.; Charles, F.; Truffault, V.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561115\nThe circadian rhythm is an endogenous rhythm, defined by repeated metabolic oscillations every 24 hours under constant parameters. In plants, the circadian rhythm regulates the growth through photosynthesis and the management of carbohydrates. In indoor farming, the photoperiod is independent from the sunlight and is of interest to increase energy savings. In this work, we studied the effects of modifications of photoperiods on indoor-grown lettuces (L. sativa), which were then not tuned with the circadian rhythm. The pattern of photoperiods applied was: 16/12-16/8-16/8. A mutant-free study was carried out to avoid genes shutdown unintended side effects and to evaluate the impact of the circadian rhythm under marketable production conditions. We observed that the circadian regulation of the stomatal conductance was the main limiting factor of net photosynthesis when the photoperiod is exceptionally not tuned with the circadian rhythm. In our experiment, the disruption of the circadian rhythm decreased the photosynthetic activity by 6.2% throughout the light period, with no alteration of the yield, morphology or light and water use efficiencies. Furthermore, starch depletion induced by the changes in the photoperiod could not explain variations of the net photosynthetic activity during the following light period. Interestingly, disrupting the circadian rhythm saved 5% of lighting time compared to the control, which can be converted into energy savings. Consequently, the circadian rhythm can be defined as a limiting factor for reducing energy consumption in indoor farming. Further characterization of the links between the photosynthesis-carbohydrates-growth continuum and the circadian rhythm is thus required.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the needs of expert knowledge from a wide range of areas in any field. Here we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect major research paradigm shifts and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnovers of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

Significance statementChanges in scientific paradigms are foundational for the advancement of science, but such changes are difficult to summarize, quantify, and illustrate. These challenges are exacerbated by the rapid, exponential growth of literature. Applying a combination of machine learning and language modeling to hundreds of thousands of published abstracts, we demonstrate that a scientific field (i.e., plant science) can be summarized as interconnected subfields evolving from one another. We also reveal insights into major research trends and the rise and decline in the use of model organisms in different countries. Our study demonstrates how artificial intelligence and language models can be broadly applied to understand scientific advances that inform science policy and funding decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The puzzle-shaped cells found in the shoot epidermis of many plant species are a fascinating example of complex cell shapes. Because biological form often follows function, the unique shape of these cells suggests that they must serve some adaptive purpose for the plant. We previously proposed that these intricate shapes provide an effective strategy for reducing mechanical stress on the cell wall when epidermal cells undergo growth in more than one direction. Here we analyze a large selection of living and paleo plant species and find that the ability to make puzzle cells is a shared feature across all plant species, although their presence can be hidden as it varies depending on the organ, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. Computational modeling of Arabidopsis and maize epidermal cells revealed that presence and patterning of lobes is a dynamic process that is intricately linked to the growth history and environmental context of the plant organ. Conversely, disrupted lobeyness in mutants or with drug treatments affects plant development and leads to compensatory strategies. We propose that the mechanism underlying the formation of puzzle-shaped cells is likely conserved among higher plants and is a response to a developmental constraint driven by growth and mechanical stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infectious diseases drive the evolution of wild plants and impact yield in crop plants. Like animals, plants can sense biotic threats via conserved pathogen-associated patterns (PAMPs). Since an overly robust immune response can harm plants, understanding the mechanisms for tuning defense responses to the appropriate level is vital as we endeavor to develop pathogen-resistant crops. In this paper, we studied the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor (PRR) EFR, which senses bacterial EF-Tu. An inverted-repeat transposon (Ea-IR) between EFR and the neighboring XI-k locus controls local chromatin organization, promoting the formation of a repressive chromatin loop. Upon pathogen infection, the chromatin landscape around EFR and Xl-k dynamically changes to allow for increased EFR transcription. Chromatin opening facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II across the neighboring XI-k gene termination site, leading to a longer XI-k transcript that includes Ea-IR sequences. Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes process the longer Xl-k transcript into small RNAs (sRNAs), which reset chromatin topology to a repressive state, attenuating, in turn, the immune response, reminiscent of attenuation of receptor signaling in other systems. From an evolutionary point of view, we found that natural Arabidopsis accessions missing Ea-IR have a constitutive &#34;EFR-open&#34; chromatin configuration that correlates with higher basal EFR levels and higher background resistance to pathogens. Collectively, our study offers evidence for a scenario in which a transposon, chromatin organization, and gene expression interact to fine-tune immune responses, both during the course of infection and in the course of evolution. Similar gene-associated IRs in crops could provide valuable non-coding targets for genome editing or assisted plant breeding programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIMore than 15% of all vascular plant species may remain scientifically undescribed, and many of the &gt;340,000 described species have no or few geographic records documenting their distribution. Identifying and understanding taxonomic and geographic knowledge shortfalls is key to prioritising future collection and conservation efforts.
C_LIO_LIUsing extensive data for 343,754 vascular plant species and time-to-event analyses, we conducted multiple tests related to plant taxonomic and geographic data shortfalls, and identified 29 global diversity darkspots (regions expected to lack most information about their species diversity and distribution by 2050). We defined priority regions for future collection according to several socio-economic and environmental scenarios.
C_LIO_LIOur understanding of the global diversity and distribution of vascular plant species is estimated to remain incomplete and biased by 2050 under current collection patterns. Most plant diversity darkspots are found within biodiversity hotspots, except New Guinea. We identify the Philippines, Myanmar, Assam, Bangladesh, East Himalaya, Iran, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru, as global collection priorities under all environmental and socio-economic conditions considered.
C_LIO_LIOur study provides a framework to accelerate plant species documentation for the implementation of conservation actions. As digitisation of the worlds herbaria progresses, collection and conservation priorities may soon be identifiable at finer scales.

        <p class="abstract">Plants are sessile organisms that constantly adapt to their changing environment. The root is exposed to numerous environmental signals ranging from nutrients and water to microbial molecular patterns. These signals can trigger distinct responses including the rapid increase or decrease of root growth. Consequently, using root growth as a readout for signal perception can help decipher which external cues are perceived by roots, and how these signals are integrated. To date, studies measuring root growth responses using large numbers of roots have been limited by a lack of high-throughput image acquisition, poor scalability of analytical methods, or low spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed the Root Walker pipeline, which uses automated microscopes to acquire time-series images of many roots exposed to controlled treatments with high-spatiotemporal-resolution, in conjunction with fast and automated image analysis software. We demonstrate the power of Root Walker by quantifying root growth rate responses at different time and throughput scales upon treatments with natural auxin, and upon treatment with two mitogen-associated protein kinase cascade inhibitors. We find a concentration-dependent root growth response to auxin and reveal the specificity of one MAPK inhibitor. We further demonstrate the ability of Root Walker for conducting genetic screens by performing a genome wide association study on 260 accessions under 2 weeks. This revealed known and unknown root growth regulators. Root Walker promises to be a useful toolkit for the plant science community, allowing large-scale screening of root growth dynamics for a variety of purposes, including genetic screens for root sensing and root growth response mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) as signaling molecule in both plant and animal development1-7, the regulatory mechanisms downstream of NO remain largely unclear. Here, we show that NO is involved in Arabidopsis shoot stem cell control via modifying expression and activity of ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a core component of the RNA directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway. Mutations in components of the RdDM pathway cause meristematic defects, and reduce responses of the stem cell system to NO signaling. Importantly, we found that the stem cell inducing WUSCHEL transcription factor directly interacts with AGO4 in an NO dependent manner, explaining how these two signaling systems may converge to modify DNA methylation patterns. Taken together, our results reveal that NO signaling plays an important role in controlling plant stem cell homeostasis via the regulation of de novo DNA methylation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Huanglongbing (HLB, or citrus greening disease) affects all citrus varieties world-wide. In the USA, Asia, and South America the causal agent is &#34;Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus&#34; (CLas), a phloem-limited, uncultured, alphaproteobacterium. The hemipteran insect vector, Diaphorina citri (Asian citrus psyllid) acquires and transmits CLas in a circulative, propagative manner. In addition to CLas, D. citri hosts multiple symbiotic bacteria including Wolbachia (wDi). In D. citri, wDi has been sequenced and studied but specific roles in D. citri biology are unknown. Using well established quantitative PCR methods we measured CLas titer in D. citri collected from four groves in central Florida with distinct HLB management strategies and tested whether CLas and wDi titer were correlated in a sub-set of these insects. Grove site had the largest effect on CLas titer. Sex had no effect on CLas titer, while higher wDi titer was correlated with CLas-uninfected insects. Our results suggest that more directed follow-up research is necessary and important to clarify whether field management tactics influence CLas titer in D. citri and to better understand gene-by-environment interactions among D. citri, wDi and CLas. Now that millions of trees in Florida have been treated with injectable formulations of oxytetracycline, which is likely to decrease bacterial populations in D. citri, this study may represent the last biologically meaningful snapshot of grove-level vector-pathogen ecology in the state during the HLB epidemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth, which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots, pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between auxin, growth, and the resolution of mechanical conflicts. However, the exact mechanisms by which this coordination is achieved are still unknown. Here, we propose a model that integrates tissue mechanics and auxin transport, revealing a connection between the auxin-induced relaxation of mechanical stress in the pericycle and auxin signalling in the endodermis. We show that the growth of pericycle cells is initially limited by the endodermis, resulting in a modest initial growth. However, this modest growth is sufficient to redirect auxin to the overlying endodermis, which then actively accommodates the growth, allowing for the subsequent development of the lateral root. Our model uncovers the mechanical parameters that underlie endodermal accommodation and how the structure and shape of the endodermis influence the formation of the new root. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between mechanics and auxin flow during lateral root initiation, emphasizing the vital role of the endodermis in shaping root development through mechanotransduction and auxin signalling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plants rely on Nucleotide-binding, Leucine-rich repeat Receptors (NLRs) for pathogen recognition. Highly variable NLRs (hvNLRs) show remarkable intraspecies diversity, while their low variability paralogs (non-hvNLRs) are conserved between ecotypes. At a population level, hvNLRs provide new pathogen recognition specificities, but the association between allelic diversity and genomic and epigenomic features has not been established. Our investigation of NLRs in Arabidopsis Col-0 has revealed that hvNLRs show higher expression, less gene body cytosine methylation, and closer proximity to transposable elements than non-hvNLRs. hvNLRs show elevated synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity and are in chromatin states associated with an increased probability of mutation. Diversifying selection maintains variability at a subset of codons of hvNLRs, while purifying selection maintains conservation at non-hvNLRs. How these features are established and maintained, and whether they contribute to the observed diversity of hvNLRs is key to understanding the evolution of plant innate immune receptors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The circadian rhythm is an endogenous rhythm, defined by repeated metabolic oscillations every 24 hours under constant parameters. In plants, the circadian rhythm regulates the growth through photosynthesis and the management of carbohydrates. In indoor farming, the photoperiod is independent from the sunlight and is of interest to increase energy savings. In this work, we studied the effects of modifications of photoperiods on indoor-grown lettuces (L. sativa), which were then not tuned with the circadian rhythm. The pattern of photoperiods applied was: 16/12-16/8-16/8. A mutant-free study was carried out to avoid genes shutdown unintended side effects and to evaluate the impact of the circadian rhythm under marketable production conditions. We observed that the circadian regulation of the stomatal conductance was the main limiting factor of net photosynthesis when the photoperiod is exceptionally not tuned with the circadian rhythm. In our experiment, the disruption of the circadian rhythm decreased the photosynthetic activity by 6.2% throughout the light period, with no alteration of the yield, morphology or light and water use efficiencies. Furthermore, starch depletion induced by the changes in the photoperiod could not explain variations of the net photosynthetic activity during the following light period. Interestingly, disrupting the circadian rhythm saved 5% of lighting time compared to the control, which can be converted into energy savings. Consequently, the circadian rhythm can be defined as a limiting factor for reducing energy consumption in indoor farming. Further characterization of the links between the photosynthesis-carbohydrates-growth continuum and the circadian rhythm is thus required.</p>
