Obtaining information on the fundamental biology of these organisms and how they infect the plant has been restricted by the ability to visualize intact nematodes using small molecule stains, antibodies, or in situ hybridization. Consequently, there is limited information available about the internal composition of the nematodes or the biology of the effector molecules they use to reprogram their host plant. We present the Sperling prep - a whole mount method for nematode preparation that enables staining with small molecules, antibodies, or in situ hybridization chain reaction. This method does not require specialized apparatus and utilizes typical laboratory equipment and materials. By dissociating the strong cuticle and interior muscle layers, we enabled entry of the small molecule stains into the tissue. After permeabilization, small molecule stains can be used to visualize the nuclei with the DNA stain DAPI and the internal structures of the digestive tract and longitudinal musculature with the filamentous actin stain phalloidin. The permeabilization even allows entry of larger antibodies, albeit with lower efficiency. Finally, this method works exceptionally well with in situ HCR. Using this method, we have visualized effector transcripts specific to the dorsal gland and the subventral grand of the sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, multiplexed in the same nematode. We were able to visualize the internal structures of the nematode as well as key effector transcripts that are used during plant infection and parasitism. Therefore, this method provides an important toolkit for studying the biology of plant-parasitic nematodes.\nPlant-based production of diverse human milk oligosaccharides\nAuthors: Barnum, C. R.; Paviani, B.; Couture, G.; Masarweh, C.; Chen, Y.; Huang, Y.-P.; Mills, D. A.; Lebrilla, C. B.; Barile, D.; Yang, M.; Shih, P.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558286\nHuman milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a diverse class of carbohydrates that aid in the health and development of infants. The vast health benefits of HMOs have made them a commercial target for microbial production; however, producing the [~]130 structurally diverse HMOs at scale has proven difficult. Here, we produce a vast diversity of HMOs by leveraging the robust carbohydrate anabolism of plants. This diversity includes high value HMOs, such as lacto-N-fucopentaose I, that have not yet been commercially produced using state-of-the-art microbial fermentative processes. HMOs produced in transgenic plants provided strong bifidogenic properties, indicating their ability to serve as a prebiotic supplement. Technoeconomic analyses demonstrate that producing HMOs in plants provides a path to the large-scale production of specific HMOs at lower prices than microbial production platforms. Our work demonstrates the promise in leveraging plants for the cheap and sustainable production of HMOs.\nMechanotransduction in Lateral Root Initiation: A Model Integrating Growth Mechanics and Auxin Signaling\nAuthors: Ramos, J. R. D.; Reyes-Hernandez, B. J.; Alim, K.; Maizel, A.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558377\nPlant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth, which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots, pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between auxin, growth, and the resolution of mechanical conflicts. However, the exact mechanisms by which this coordination is achieved are still unknown. Here, we propose a model that integrates tissue mechanics and auxin transport, revealing a connection between the auxin-induced relaxation of mechanical stress in the pericycle and auxin signalling in the endodermis. We show that the growth of pericycle cells is initially limited by the endodermis, resulting in a modest initial growth. However, this modest growth is sufficient to redirect auxin to the overlying endodermis, which then actively accommodates the growth, allowing for the subsequent development of the lateral root. Our model uncovers the mechanical parameters that underlie endodermal accommodation and how the structure and shape of the endodermis influence the formation of the new root. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between mechanics and auxin flow during lateral root initiation, emphasizing the vital role of the endodermis in shaping root development through mechanotransduction and auxin signalling.\nThe Arabidopsis U1 snRNP regulates mRNA 3'-end processing\nAuthors: Mangilet, A. F.; Weber, J.; Schueler, S.; Droste-Borel, I.; Streicher, S.; Schmutzer, T.; Rot, G.; Macek, B.; Laubinger, S.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558503\nThe removal of introns by the spliceosome is a key gene regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes, with the U1 snRNP subunit of the spliceosome playing a crucial role in the early stages of splicing. Studies in metazoans show that the U1 snRNP also conducts splicing-independent functions, but the lack of genetic tools and knowledge about U1 snRNP-associated proteins have limited the study of such splicing-independent functions in plants. Here, we describe an RNA-centric approach that identified more than 200 proteins associated with the Arabidopsis U1 snRNP, among them mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. The loss of U1 core components is linked to premature cleavage and polyadenylation within gene bodies and alternative polyadenylation site selection in 3-UTRs. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive view of U1 snRNP interactors and reveals novel functions in regulating mRNA 3-end processing in Arabidopsis, thus establishing the groundwork for a better understanding of non-canonical functions of plant U1 snRNPs.\nGENOMES UNCOUPLED1: an RNA-binding protein required for early PSII biogenesis\nAuthors: Cui, C.; Sun, S.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, Y.; Kim, C.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558905\nGenomes Uncoupled1 (GUN1), a nuclear-encoded chloroplast pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, serves as a master integrator of diverse retrograde signals, mediating chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Although PPR proteins primarily function in organelle RNA metabolism, a target RNA of GUN1 remained unknown. This study reveals that GUN1 recognizes psbD transcripts derived from a blue light-responsive promoter (BLRP), transcripts referred to as psbD BLRP. Overexpression of GUN1 significantly reduces the levels of psbD BLRP, whereas the loss of GUN1 leads to the accumulation of the putative target RNA. The in vitro RNA and in vivo genetic studies further demonstrate the critical role of the C-terminal small MutS-related (SMR) domain in stimulating psbD BLRP processing and PsbD (D2, a PSII core protein) synthesis. The GUN1-dependent psbD BLRP processing promotes PSII biogenesis during the early seedling development and de-etiolation phase. This finding underscores the role of GUN1 as an RNA-binding protein, highlighting the essential function of the SMR domain in processing the target RNA. SignificanceBiogenic retrograde signaling is essential in regulating chloroplast biogenesis, and it entails a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein, Genomes Uncoupled1 (GUN1). Since its initial discovery in 1993, the gun1 mutant has been widely used to reveal the precise function of GUN1 in plastids as well as its downstream signaling components. Although GUN1 contains pentatricopeptide repeat motifs, it has been considered a non-canonical PPR protein because no one could demonstrate GUN1-RNA interaction in planta. However, through our computational analysis of PPR codes and subsequent biochemical studies, we were able to unravel its putative target RNA, namely psbD BLRP. Therefore, our finding may lead to a reevaluation of GUN1 research in the context of RNA metabolism and a revision of our current understanding of GUN1.\nPGR5 is required to avoid photosynthetic oscillations during light transitions\nAuthors: Johnson, M. P.; Degen, G. E.; Pastorelli, F.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558795\nThe production of ATP and NADPH by the light reactions of photosynthesis and their consumption by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and other downstream metabolic reactions requires careful regulation. Environmental shifts perturb this careful balance, leading to photo-oxidative stress and losses in CO2 assimilation. Imbalances in the production and consumption of ATP and NADPH manifest themselves as transient instability in the chlorophyll fluorescence, P700, electrochromic shift and CO2 uptake signals recorded on leaves. These oscillations can be induced in wild-type plants by sudden shifts in CO2 concentration or light intensity, however mutants exhibiting increased oscillatory behaviour have yet to be reported. This has precluded an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms employed by plants to suppress oscillations. Here we show that the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant, which is deficient in PGR5-dependent cyclic electron transfer (CET), exhibits increased oscillatory behaviour. In contrast, mutants lacking the NDH-dependent CET are largely unaffected. The absence of oscillations in the hope2 mutant, which like pgr5, lacks photosynthetic control and exhibits high ATP synthase conductivity, ruled out loss of these photoprotective mechanisms as causes. Instead, we observed slower formation of proton motive force and by inference ATP synthesis in pgr5 following environmental perturbation, leading to the transient reduction of the electron transfer chain and photosynthetic oscillations. PGR5-dependent CET therefore plays a major role in damping the effect of environmental perturbations on photosynthesis to avoid losses in CO2 fixation.\nAlternative splicing regulation in plants by effectors of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi\nAuthors: Requena, N.; Betz, R.; Heidt, S.; Figueira-Galan, D.; Langner, T.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558436\nMost plants in natural ecosystems live in association with AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) fungi to survive under poor nutrient conditions and to cope with other abiotic and biotic stresses. To engage in symbiosis, AM fungi secrete effector molecules that, similar to pathogenic effectors, reprogram plant cells. Despite numerous effectors being predicted in the genome of AM fungi, only a few have been functionally characterized. Here we show that the SP7-like family, a Glomeromycotina-specific effector family, impacts on the alternative splicing program of their hosts. SP7-like effectors localize at nuclear condensates and interact with the plant mRNA processing machinery, most prominently with the splicing factor SR45 and the core splicing proteins U170K and U2AF35. Ectopic expression of two of these effectors in the crop plant potato changed the alternative splicing pattern of a specific subset of genes. Unravelling the communication mechanisms between symbiotic fungi and their host plants will help to identify targets to improve plant nutrition.\nViable mutants of essential genes in Physcomitrium patens as tools for studying primary metabolic processes\nAuthors: Haslam, T. M.; Herrfurth, C.; Feussner, I.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558677\nSphingolipids are essential components of plant cells, which have been notoriously difficult to study in part due to pleiotropic or lethal knock-out mutant phenotypes. By relying on alternative end-joining of double stranded breaks, we successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to generate a population of diverse, viable mutant alleles of genes required for sphingolipid assembly in totipotent protoplasts of the moss Physcomitrium patens. We targeted the INOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE (IPCS) gene family, which catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), the most abundant class of sphingolipids found in plants. We isolated knock-out single mutants and knock-down higher-order mutants showing a spectrum of deficiencies in GIPC content. Remarkably, we also identified two mutant alleles accumulating inositol phosphorylceramides, the direct products of IPCS activity, and provide our best explanation for this unexpected phenotype. Our approach is broadly applicable for studying essential genes and gene families, and for obtaining unusual lesions within a gene of interest.\nHigh-resolution mapping of Ryd4Hb, a major resistance gene to Barley yellow dwarf virus from Hordeum bulbosum\nAuthors: Pidon, H.; Ruge-Wehling, B.; Will, T.; Habekuss, A.; Wendler, N.; Oldach, K.; Maasberg-Prelle, A.; Korzun, V.; Stein, N.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558385\nVirus diseases are causing high yield losses in crops worldwide. The Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) complex is responsible for one of the most widespread and economically important viral diseases of cereals. While no complete resistance gene has been uncovered in the primary genepool of barley, sources of resistance were identified in the wild relative Hordeum bulbosum, representing the secondary genepool of barley. One such locus, Ryd4Hb, has been previously introgressed into barley, and was allocated to chromosome 3H, but is tightly linked to a sublethality factor that prevents the incorporation and utilization of Ryd4Hb in barley varieties. To solve this problem, we fine-mapped Ryd4Hb and separated it from this negative factor. We narrowed the Ryd4Hb locus to a 66.5 kbp physical interval in the barley Morex reference genome. The region comprises one complete and one partial gene from the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat immune receptor family, typical of dominant virus resistance genes. The closest homolog to these two Ryd4Hb candidate genes is the wheat Sr35 stem rust resistance gene. In addition to the fine mapping, we reduced the sublethality factor interval to 600 kbp in barley. Aphid feeding experiments demonstrated that Ryd4Hb provides a direct resistance to BYDV rather than a resistance to its vector. The presented results, including the high-throughput molecular markers, will permit a more targeted selection of the resistance in breeding, enabling the use of Ryd4Hb in barley varieties. Key messageWe mapped Ryd4Hb in a 66.5 kpb interval in barley and dissociated it from a sublethality factor. These results will enable a targeted selection of the resistance in barley breeding.\nVirulence patterns of oat crown rust in Australia - season 2022\nAuthors: Henningsen, E. C.; Lewis, D. C.; Nguyen, D. T.; Sperschneider, J.; Kianian, S. F.; Stone, E.; Dodds, P.; Figueroa, M.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.558528\nPuccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is an important foliar pathogen of oat which causes crown rust disease. The virulence profile of 48 Pca isolates derived from different locations in Australia was characterised using a collection of oat lines often utilised in rust surveys in the USA and Australia. This analysis indicates that Pca populations in Eastern Australia are broadly virulent, in contrast to the population in Western Australia (WA). Several oat lines Pc genes are effective against all rust samples collected from WA, suggesting they may provide useful resistance in this region if deployed in combination. We identified 19 lines from the US oat differential set that display disease resistance to Pca in WA, some in agreement with previous rust survey reports. We adopted the 10-letter nomenclature system to define oat crown rust races in Australia and compare the frequency of those virulence traits to published data from the USA. Based on this nomenclature, 42 unique races were detected among the 48 isolates, reflecting the high diversity of virulence phenotypes for Pca in Australia. Nevertheless, the Pca population in the USA is substantially more broadly virulent than that of Australia. Close examination of resistance profiles for the oat differential set lines after infection with Pca supports hypotheses of allelism or redundancy among Pc genes or the presence of several R genes in some oat differential lines. These findings illustrate the need to deconvolute the oat differential set using molecular tools.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Plant-parasitic nematodes compromise the agriculture of a wide variety of the most common crops worldwide. Obtaining information on the fundamental biology of these organisms and how they infect the plant has been restricted by the ability to visualize intact nematodes using small molecule stains, antibodies, or in situ hybridization. Consequently, there is limited information available about the internal composition of the nematodes or the biology of the effector molecules they use to reprogram their host plant. We present the Sperling prep - a whole mount method for nematode preparation that enables staining with small molecules, antibodies, or in situ hybridization chain reaction. This method does not require specialized apparatus and utilizes typical laboratory equipment and materials. By dissociating the strong cuticle and interior muscle layers, we enabled entry of the small molecule stains into the tissue. After permeabilization, small molecule stains can be used to visualize the nuclei with the DNA stain DAPI and the internal structures of the digestive tract and longitudinal musculature with the filamentous actin stain phalloidin. The permeabilization even allows entry of larger antibodies, albeit with lower efficiency. Finally, this method works exceptionally well with in situ HCR. Using this method, we have visualized effector transcripts specific to the dorsal gland and the subventral grand of the sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, multiplexed in the same nematode. We were able to visualize the internal structures of the nematode as well as key effector transcripts that are used during plant infection and parasitism. Therefore, this method provides an important toolkit for studying the biology of plant-parasitic nematodes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a diverse class of carbohydrates that aid in the health and development of infants. The vast health benefits of HMOs have made them a commercial target for microbial production; however, producing the [~]130 structurally diverse HMOs at scale has proven difficult. Here, we produce a vast diversity of HMOs by leveraging the robust carbohydrate anabolism of plants. This diversity includes high value HMOs, such as lacto-N-fucopentaose I, that have not yet been commercially produced using state-of-the-art microbial fermentative processes. HMOs produced in transgenic plants provided strong bifidogenic properties, indicating their ability to serve as a prebiotic supplement. Technoeconomic analyses demonstrate that producing HMOs in plants provides a path to the large-scale production of specific HMOs at lower prices than microbial production platforms. Our work demonstrates the promise in leveraging plants for the cheap and sustainable production of HMOs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth, which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots, pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between auxin, growth, and the resolution of mechanical conflicts. However, the exact mechanisms by which this coordination is achieved are still unknown. Here, we propose a model that integrates tissue mechanics and auxin transport, revealing a connection between the auxin-induced relaxation of mechanical stress in the pericycle and auxin signalling in the endodermis. We show that the growth of pericycle cells is initially limited by the endodermis, resulting in a modest initial growth. However, this modest growth is sufficient to redirect auxin to the overlying endodermis, which then actively accommodates the growth, allowing for the subsequent development of the lateral root. Our model uncovers the mechanical parameters that underlie endodermal accommodation and how the structure and shape of the endodermis influence the formation of the new root. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between mechanics and auxin flow during lateral root initiation, emphasizing the vital role of the endodermis in shaping root development through mechanotransduction and auxin signalling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The removal of introns by the spliceosome is a key gene regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes, with the U1 snRNP subunit of the spliceosome playing a crucial role in the early stages of splicing. Studies in metazoans show that the U1 snRNP also conducts splicing-independent functions, but the lack of genetic tools and knowledge about U1 snRNP-associated proteins have limited the study of such splicing-independent functions in plants. Here, we describe an RNA-centric approach that identified more than 200 proteins associated with the Arabidopsis U1 snRNP, among them mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. The loss of U1 core components is linked to premature cleavage and polyadenylation within gene bodies and alternative polyadenylation site selection in 3-UTRs. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive view of U1 snRNP interactors and reveals novel functions in regulating mRNA 3-end processing in Arabidopsis, thus establishing the groundwork for a better understanding of non-canonical functions of plant U1 snRNPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genomes Uncoupled1 (GUN1), a nuclear-encoded chloroplast pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, serves as a master integrator of diverse retrograde signals, mediating chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Although PPR proteins primarily function in organelle RNA metabolism, a target RNA of GUN1 remained unknown. This study reveals that GUN1 recognizes psbD transcripts derived from a blue light-responsive promoter (BLRP), transcripts referred to as psbD BLRP. Overexpression of GUN1 significantly reduces the levels of psbD BLRP, whereas the loss of GUN1 leads to the accumulation of the putative target RNA. The in vitro RNA and in vivo genetic studies further demonstrate the critical role of the C-terminal small MutS-related (SMR) domain in stimulating psbD BLRP processing and PsbD (D2, a PSII core protein) synthesis. The GUN1-dependent psbD BLRP processing promotes PSII biogenesis during the early seedling development and de-etiolation phase. This finding underscores the role of GUN1 as an RNA-binding protein, highlighting the essential function of the SMR domain in processing the target RNA.

SignificanceBiogenic retrograde signaling is essential in regulating chloroplast biogenesis, and it entails a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein, Genomes Uncoupled1 (GUN1). Since its initial discovery in 1993, the gun1 mutant has been widely used to reveal the precise function of GUN1 in plastids as well as its downstream signaling components. Although GUN1 contains pentatricopeptide repeat motifs, it has been considered a non-canonical PPR protein because no one could demonstrate GUN1-RNA interaction in planta. However, through our computational analysis of PPR codes and subsequent biochemical studies, we were able to unravel its putative target RNA, namely psbD BLRP. Therefore, our finding may lead to a reevaluation of GUN1 research in the context of RNA metabolism and a revision of our current understanding of GUN1.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The production of ATP and NADPH by the light reactions of photosynthesis and their consumption by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and other downstream metabolic reactions requires careful regulation. Environmental shifts perturb this careful balance, leading to photo-oxidative stress and losses in CO2 assimilation. Imbalances in the production and consumption of ATP and NADPH manifest themselves as transient instability in the chlorophyll fluorescence, P700, electrochromic shift and CO2 uptake signals recorded on leaves. These oscillations can be induced in wild-type plants by sudden shifts in CO2 concentration or light intensity, however mutants exhibiting increased oscillatory behaviour have yet to be reported. This has precluded an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms employed by plants to suppress oscillations. Here we show that the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant, which is deficient in PGR5-dependent cyclic electron transfer (CET), exhibits increased oscillatory behaviour. In contrast, mutants lacking the NDH-dependent CET are largely unaffected. The absence of oscillations in the hope2 mutant, which like pgr5, lacks photosynthetic control and exhibits high ATP synthase conductivity, ruled out loss of these photoprotective mechanisms as causes. Instead, we observed slower formation of proton motive force and by inference ATP synthesis in pgr5 following environmental perturbation, leading to the transient reduction of the electron transfer chain and photosynthetic oscillations. PGR5-dependent CET therefore plays a major role in damping the effect of environmental perturbations on photosynthesis to avoid losses in CO2 fixation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most plants in natural ecosystems live in association with AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) fungi to survive under poor nutrient conditions and to cope with other abiotic and biotic stresses. To engage in symbiosis, AM fungi secrete effector molecules that, similar to pathogenic effectors, reprogram plant cells. Despite numerous effectors being predicted in the genome of AM fungi, only a few have been functionally characterized. Here we show that the SP7-like family, a Glomeromycotina-specific effector family, impacts on the alternative splicing program of their hosts. SP7-like effectors localize at nuclear condensates and interact with the plant mRNA processing machinery, most prominently with the splicing factor SR45 and the core splicing proteins U170K and U2AF35. Ectopic expression of two of these effectors in the crop plant potato changed the alternative splicing pattern of a specific subset of genes. Unravelling the communication mechanisms between symbiotic fungi and their host plants will help to identify targets to improve plant nutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sphingolipids are essential components of plant cells, which have been notoriously difficult to study in part due to pleiotropic or lethal knock-out mutant phenotypes. By relying on alternative end-joining of double stranded breaks, we successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to generate a population of diverse, viable mutant alleles of genes required for sphingolipid assembly in totipotent protoplasts of the moss Physcomitrium patens. We targeted the INOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE (IPCS) gene family, which catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), the most abundant class of sphingolipids found in plants. We isolated knock-out single mutants and knock-down higher-order mutants showing a spectrum of deficiencies in GIPC content. Remarkably, we also identified two mutant alleles accumulating inositol phosphorylceramides, the direct products of IPCS activity, and provide our best explanation for this unexpected phenotype. Our approach is broadly applicable for studying essential genes and gene families, and for obtaining unusual lesions within a gene of interest.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Virus diseases are causing high yield losses in crops worldwide. The Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) complex is responsible for one of the most widespread and economically important viral diseases of cereals. While no complete resistance gene has been uncovered in the primary genepool of barley, sources of resistance were identified in the wild relative Hordeum bulbosum, representing the secondary genepool of barley. One such locus, Ryd4Hb, has been previously introgressed into barley, and was allocated to chromosome 3H, but is tightly linked to a sublethality factor that prevents the incorporation and utilization of Ryd4Hb in barley varieties. To solve this problem, we fine-mapped Ryd4Hb and separated it from this negative factor. We narrowed the Ryd4Hb locus to a 66.5 kbp physical interval in the barley  Morex reference genome. The region comprises one complete and one partial gene from the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat immune receptor family, typical of dominant virus resistance genes. The closest homolog to these two Ryd4Hb candidate genes is the wheat Sr35 stem rust resistance gene. In addition to the fine mapping, we reduced the sublethality factor interval to 600 kbp in barley. Aphid feeding experiments demonstrated that Ryd4Hb provides a direct resistance to BYDV rather than a resistance to its vector. The presented results, including the high-throughput molecular markers, will permit a more targeted selection of the resistance in breeding, enabling the use of Ryd4Hb in barley varieties.

Key messageWe mapped Ryd4Hb in a 66.5 kpb interval in barley and dissociated it from a sublethality factor. These results will enable a targeted selection of the resistance in barley breeding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is an important foliar pathogen of oat which causes crown rust disease. The virulence profile of 48 Pca isolates derived from different locations in Australia was characterised using a collection of oat lines often utilised in rust surveys in the USA and Australia. This analysis indicates that Pca populations in Eastern Australia are broadly virulent, in contrast to the population in Western Australia (WA). Several oat lines Pc genes are effective against all rust samples collected from WA, suggesting they may provide useful resistance in this region if deployed in combination. We identified 19 lines from the US oat differential set that display disease resistance to Pca in WA, some in agreement with previous rust survey reports. We adopted the 10-letter nomenclature system to define oat crown rust races in Australia and compare the frequency of those virulence traits to published data from the USA. Based on this nomenclature, 42 unique races were detected among the 48 isolates, reflecting the high diversity of virulence phenotypes for Pca in Australia. Nevertheless, the Pca population in the USA is substantially more broadly virulent than that of Australia. Close examination of resistance profiles for the oat differential set lines after infection with Pca supports hypotheses of allelism or redundancy among Pc genes or the presence of several R genes in some oat differential lines. These findings illustrate the need to deconvolute the oat differential set using molecular tools.</p>
