Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.\nIsland biogeography theory and the gut: why taller people tend to harbor more diverse gut microbiomes.\nAuthors: Ramos Sarmiento, K.; Carr, A.; Diener, C.; Locey, K. J.; Gibbons, S. M.\nScore: 51.9, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552554\nPrior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.\nA taxonomy of multiple stable states in complex ecological communities\nAuthors: Aguade-Gorgorio, G.; Arnoldi, J.-F.; Barbier, M.; Kefi, S.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555051\nMany natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.\nSpatial patterns in the diet of Gyps vultures in India and their implications for conservation\nAuthors: Ghosh-Harihar, M.; Yadav, N.; Gurung, N.; C.S., D.; B., S.; C.K., V.; Prakash, V.; Green, R. E.; Ramakrishnan, U.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554114\nDietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in \u003e95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.\nConservation value of low-elevation forests for birds in agroforestry-dominated landscapes in a biodiversity hotspot\nAuthors: Biswas, N.; Biniwale, S.; Sadekar, V.; Taneja, Y. V.; Suryawanshi, K.; Osuri, A. M.; Naniwadekar, R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554947\nO_LIProtected areas (PAs) and multi-use landscapes beyond PAs play important and complementary roles in conserving global biodiversity. Across the tropical forest biome, remnant forests and agroforestry plantations in mixed-use landscapes often have high taxonomic diversity, but their ability to sustain functionally and phylogenetically diverse assemblages and retain conservation-priority species is unclear. Additionally, our understanding of impacts of land-use change across species, function and communities is poor. C_LIO_LIIn Indias Western Ghats (WG) biodiversity hotspot, like in many other tropical regions, PAs cover just 12% of the land and are concentrated in higher elevations. Here, in an approximately 15,000 km2 landscape in the northern WG, we compared bird communities across six land-use categories: state-owned high-elevation PAs and low-elevation Reserved Forests beyond PAs, and privately-owned periodically clear-felled low-elevation forests and three types of low-elevation agroforestry plantations (cashew, mango, and rubber). C_LIO_LIWe sampled 184 line transects totalling 137.5 km across habitats, compared taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics and used joint species distribution models to test for species-trait-habitat associations. C_LIO_LIForests in general and lowland forests in particular had higher taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and higher occurrence probabilities of evergreen forest-affiliated, conservation-priority, and frugivores than agroforestry plantations. The ranking of land-use types varied across indicators, with rubber ranking higher than cashew and mango for functional and phylogenetic diversity but lower in species occurrence probabilities. C_LIO_LISynthesis and Applications: Our findings underscore the irreplaceability of less-disturbed forests for birds in mixed-use landscapes, especially when considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity, habitat specialists, and conservation-priority species. We advocate the simultaneous examination at multiple levels (community, species and traits) to determine the impacts of land-use change as divergent information of conservation importance is gleaned from each level. Reserved and private forests of low elevations of the Northern Western Ghats are critical for avian conservation, given that they harbour significant diversity, and the absence of representative PAs in the region. Given the vulnerability of these low-elevation forests to conversion for non-forestry activities and overexploitation for fuelwood, there is a need to develop viable models of partnership with landowners in these multi-use landscapes for ecological restoration of degraded forests.

S.; Huang, X.; Luo, Y.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.552557\nIn the accompanying Comment1, He et al. argue that the determinant role of microbial carbon use efficiency in global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage shown in Tao et al. (2023)2 was overestimated because carbon inputs were neglected in our data analysis while they suggest that our model-based analysis could be biased and model-dependent. Their argument is based on a different choice of independent variables in the data analysis and a sensitivity analysis of two process-based models other than that used in our study. We agree that both carbon inputs and outputs (as mediated by microbial processes) matter when predicting SOC storage - the question is their relative contributions. While we encourage further studies to examine how the evaluation of the relative importance of CUE to global SOC storage may vary with different model structures, He et al.s claims about Tao et al. (2023) need to be taken as an alternative, unproven hypothesis until empirical data support their specific parameterization. Here we show that an additional literature assessment of global data does not support He et al.s argument, in contrast to our study, and that further study on this topic is essential.\nSaccharomycotina yeasts defy longstanding macroecological patterns\nAuthors: David, K. T.; Harrison, M.-C.; Opulente, D. A.; LaBella, A. L.; Wolters, J. F.; Zhou, X.; Shen, X.-X.; Groenewald, M.; Pennell, M.; Hittinger, C. T.; Rokas, A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555417\nThe Saccharomycotina yeasts (\"yeasts\" hereafter) are a fungal clade of scientific, economic, and medical significance. Yeasts are highly ecologically diverse, found across a broad range of environments in every biome and continent on earth; however, little is known about what rules govern the macroecology of yeast species and their range limits in the wild. Here, we trained machine learning models on 12,221 occurrence records and 96 environmental variables to infer global distribution maps for 186 yeast species (~15% of described species from 75% of orders) and to test environmental drivers of yeast biogeography and macroecology. We found that predicted yeast diversity hotspots occur in mixed montane forests in temperate climates. Diversity in vegetation type and topography were some of the greatest predictors of yeast species richness, suggesting that microhabitats and environmental clines are key to yeast diversification. We further found that range limits in yeasts are significantly influenced by carbon niche breadth and range overlap with other yeast species, with carbon specialists and species in high diversity environments exhibiting reduced geographic ranges. Finally, yeasts contravene many longstanding macroecological principles, including the latitudinal diversity gradient, temperature-dependent species richness, and latitude-dependent range size (Rapoport's rule). These results unveil how the environment governs the global diversity and distribution of species in the yeast subphylum. These high-resolution models of yeast species distributions will facilitate the prediction of economically relevant and emerging pathogenic species under current and future climate scenarios.\nProvision of essential resources as a persistence strategy in food webs\nAuthors: Raatz, M.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.27.525839\nPairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.\nComparative abundance and diversity of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae and Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae species complexes throughout the Durance River catchment from its French Alps sources to its delta\nAuthors: Morris, C. E.; Lacroix, C.; Chandeysson, C.; Guilbaud, C.; Monteil, C.; Piry, S.; Rochelle-Newall, E.; Fiorini, S.; Van Gijsegem, F.; Barny, M.-A.; Berge, O.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2022.09.06.506731\nRivers, creeks, streams are integrators of biological, chemical and physical processes occurring in a catchment linking land cover from the headwaters to the outlet. The dynamics of human and animal pathogens in catchments have been widely studied in a large variety of contexts allowing the optimization of disease risk reduction. In parallel, there is an emerging awareness that crop pathogens might also be disseminated via surface waters especially when they are used for irrigation. However, there are no studies on the extent to which potential plant pathogens are present, nor about their dynamics, along the full course of a catchment. Here we have compared the seasonal dynamics of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) and the Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) species complexes along a 270 km stretch of the Durance River from the upstream alpine reaches to the downstream agricultural production areas at the confluence with the Rhone River at Avignon. Among 168 samples collected at 21 sites in fall, winter, spring and summer of 2016 and 2017, Psy strains were detected at all sampling sites and in 156 of the samples at population densities up to 10e5 bacteria per L. In contrast, SRP strains were detected in 98 of the samples, mostly from the southern part of the river, at population densities that did not exceed 3 x 10e4 bacteria per L. Among the biological and chemical parameters that were characterized at each sampling site, temperature was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variability in population size for both species complexes. Psy densities decreased with increasing temperature whereas SRP densities increased with increasing temperature. River-borne populations of SRP were composed mainly of Pectobacterium versatile and P. aquaticum that have little known epidemiological importance. Only a few strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya species reputed for their epidemiological impact were observed. In contrast, Psy populations at all sites were dominated by a genetic lineage of phylogroup 2 known from other studies for its broad host range and its geographic and habitat ubiquity. Our observations suggest that surveillance of river water for SRP could be leveraged to signal diagnostic and management reactions to avoid disease outbreaks. In contrast, the constant presence of Psy throughout the catchment in absence of regular and widespread disease outbreaks due to this group of bacteria suggests that surveillance should focus on future changes in land use, river water conditions and agronomic practices that could destabilize the mechanisms currently holding Psy outbreaks in check.\nTick-borne zoonotic flaviviruses and Borrelia infections in wildlife hosts: what have field studies contributed?\nAuthors: Poisson, A.; Boulinier, T.; Bournez, L.; Gonzalez, G.; Migne, C. V.; Moutailler, S.; Faivre, B.; Metras, R.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554822\nTick-borne flaviviruses and Borrelia spp. are globally spread pathogens of zoonotic potential which are maintained by a transmission cycle at the interface between ticks and vertebrate hosts, mainly wild animals. We reviewed how those infections have been studied in wildlife species in the field to discuss how collected data provided relevant epidemiological information and identify needs for further studies. The literature was screened for populational studies on direct or antibody detection for tick-borne Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses in animals, in the wild. Overall, Borrelia spp. were more studied (73% of case studies, representing 297 host species) than flaviviruses (27% of case studies, representing 114 host species). Studies on both Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses focused mainly on the same species (namely bank vole and yellow-necked mouse). Species with potential to act as reservoir hosts were overlooked, notably passerine birds. Most studies were order-specific and cross-sectional. We highlight the necessity of collecting both demographics and infection data in wildlife studies, and to consider communities of species, to better estimate zoonotic risk potential.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in &gt;95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIProtected areas (PAs) and multi-use landscapes beyond PAs play important and complementary roles in conserving global biodiversity. Across the tropical forest biome, remnant forests and agroforestry plantations in mixed-use landscapes often have high taxonomic diversity, but their ability to sustain functionally and phylogenetically diverse assemblages and retain conservation-priority species is unclear. Additionally, our understanding of impacts of land-use change across species, function and communities is poor.
C_LIO_LIIn Indias Western Ghats (WG) biodiversity hotspot, like in many other tropical regions, PAs cover just 12% of the land and are concentrated in higher elevations. Here, in an approximately 15,000 km2 landscape in the northern WG, we compared bird communities across six land-use categories: state-owned high-elevation PAs and low-elevation Reserved Forests beyond PAs, and privately-owned periodically clear-felled low-elevation forests and three types of low-elevation agroforestry plantations (cashew, mango, and rubber).
C_LIO_LIWe sampled 184 line transects totalling 137.5 km across habitats, compared taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics and used joint species distribution models to test for species-trait-habitat associations.
C_LIO_LIForests in general and lowland forests in particular had higher taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and higher occurrence probabilities of evergreen forest-affiliated, conservation-priority, and frugivores than agroforestry plantations. The ranking of land-use types varied across indicators, with rubber ranking higher than cashew and mango for functional and phylogenetic diversity but lower in species occurrence probabilities.
C_LIO_LISynthesis and Applications: Our findings underscore the irreplaceability of less-disturbed forests for birds in mixed-use landscapes, especially when considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity, habitat specialists, and conservation-priority species. We advocate the simultaneous examination at multiple levels (community, species and traits) to determine the impacts of land-use change as divergent information of conservation importance is gleaned from each level. Reserved and private forests of low elevations of the Northern Western Ghats are critical for avian conservation, given that they harbour significant diversity, and the absence of representative PAs in the region. Given the vulnerability of these low-elevation forests to conversion for non-forestry activities and overexploitation for fuelwood, there is a need to develop viable models of partnership with landowners in these multi-use landscapes for ecological restoration of degraded forests.

        <p class="abstract">In the accompanying Comment1, He et al. argue that the determinant role of microbial carbon use efficiency in global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage shown in Tao et al. (2023)2 was overestimated because carbon inputs were neglected in our data analysis while they suggest that our model-based analysis could be biased and model-dependent. Their argument is based on a different choice of independent variables in the data analysis and a sensitivity analysis of two process-based models other than that used in our study. We agree that both carbon inputs and outputs (as mediated by microbial processes) matter when predicting SOC storage - the question is their relative contributions. While we encourage further studies to examine how the evaluation of the relative importance of CUE to global SOC storage may vary with different model structures, He et al.s claims about Tao et al. (2023) need to be taken as an alternative, unproven hypothesis until empirical data support their specific parameterization. Here we show that an additional literature assessment of global data does not support He et al.s argument, in contrast to our study, and that further study on this topic is essential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Saccharomycotina yeasts (&#34;yeasts&#34; hereafter) are a fungal clade of scientific, economic, and medical significance. Yeasts are highly ecologically diverse, found across a broad range of environments in every biome and continent on earth; however, little is known about what rules govern the macroecology of yeast species and their range limits in the wild. Here, we trained machine learning models on 12,221 occurrence records and 96 environmental variables to infer global distribution maps for 186 yeast species (~15% of described species from 75% of orders) and to test environmental drivers of yeast biogeography and macroecology. We found that predicted yeast diversity hotspots occur in mixed montane forests in temperate climates. Diversity in vegetation type and topography were some of the greatest predictors of yeast species richness, suggesting that microhabitats and environmental clines are key to yeast diversification. We further found that range limits in yeasts are significantly influenced by carbon niche breadth and range overlap with other yeast species, with carbon specialists and species in high diversity environments exhibiting reduced geographic ranges. Finally, yeasts contravene many longstanding macroecological principles, including the latitudinal diversity gradient, temperature-dependent species richness, and latitude-dependent range size (Rapoport&#39;s rule). These results unveil how the environment governs the global diversity and distribution of species in the yeast subphylum. These high-resolution models of yeast species distributions will facilitate the prediction of economically relevant and emerging pathogenic species under current and future climate scenarios.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rivers, creeks, streams are integrators of biological, chemical and physical processes occurring in a catchment linking land cover from the headwaters to the outlet. The dynamics of human and animal pathogens in catchments have been widely studied in a large variety of contexts allowing the optimization of disease risk reduction. In parallel, there is an emerging awareness that crop pathogens might also be disseminated via surface waters especially when they are used for irrigation. However, there are no studies on the extent to which potential plant pathogens are present, nor about their dynamics, along the full course of a catchment. Here we have compared the seasonal dynamics of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) and the Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) species complexes along a 270 km stretch of the Durance River from the upstream alpine reaches to the downstream agricultural production areas at the confluence with the Rhone River at Avignon. Among 168 samples collected at 21 sites in fall, winter, spring and summer of 2016 and 2017, Psy strains were detected at all sampling sites and in 156 of the samples at population densities up to 10e5 bacteria per L. In contrast, SRP strains were detected in 98 of the samples, mostly from the southern part of the river, at population densities that did not exceed 3 x 10e4 bacteria per L. Among the biological and chemical parameters that were characterized at each sampling site, temperature was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variability in population size for both species complexes. Psy densities decreased with increasing temperature whereas SRP densities increased with increasing temperature. River-borne populations of SRP were composed mainly of Pectobacterium versatile and P. aquaticum that have little known epidemiological importance. Only a few strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya species reputed for their epidemiological impact were observed. In contrast, Psy populations at all sites were dominated by a genetic lineage of phylogroup 2 known from other studies for its broad host range and its geographic and habitat ubiquity. Our observations suggest that surveillance of river water for SRP could be leveraged to signal diagnostic and management reactions to avoid disease outbreaks. In contrast, the constant presence of Psy throughout the catchment in absence of regular and widespread disease outbreaks due to this group of bacteria suggests that surveillance should focus on future changes in land use, river water conditions and agronomic practices that could destabilize the mechanisms currently holding Psy outbreaks in check.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tick-borne flaviviruses and Borrelia spp. are globally spread pathogens of zoonotic potential which are maintained by a transmission cycle at the interface between ticks and vertebrate hosts, mainly wild animals. We reviewed how those infections have been studied in wildlife species in the field to discuss how collected data provided relevant epidemiological information and identify needs for further studies. The literature was screened for populational studies on direct or antibody detection for tick-borne Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses in animals, in the wild. Overall, Borrelia spp. were more studied (73% of case studies, representing 297 host species) than flaviviruses (27% of case studies, representing 114 host species). Studies on both Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses focused mainly on the same species (namely bank vole and yellow-necked mouse). Species with potential to act as reservoir hosts were overlooked, notably passerine birds. Most studies were order-specific and cross-sectional. We highlight the necessity of collecting both demographics and infection data in wildlife studies, and to consider communities of species, to better estimate zoonotic risk potential.</p>
