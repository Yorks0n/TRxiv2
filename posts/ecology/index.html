A.; Kassim, H.; Kathan, L.; Lunn, N.; Rivkin, L. R.; Salama, O. E.; Schmidt, C.; Jones, M. J.; Garroway, C. J.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574416\nRapid climate change is expected to impose strong selective pressures on wild populations, disrupting evolved life history strategies and limiting population viability1. The magnitude and pace at which environments will change means the persistence of wild populations will depend substantially on their ability to adapt genetically. However, we know very little about the capacity for evolutionary change in response to the rapid pace and predicted magnitude of warming. The Arctic is the fastest warming region on the planet2, so that is where we can first address this knowledge gap. Using estimates of epigenetic age acceleration, which indicate the accumulation of stress exposures across lifetimes3,4, we found polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay, Canada aged one year faster on average for each degree Celsius of temperature rise they experienced. As predicted by established theory, age acceleration was associated with reproducing early, a trait that prior to the onset of rapid warming, increased lifetime reproductive success for bears. However, the fitness benefit of early reproduction eroded with increased warming, reflecting a redirection of energy away from reproduction toward maintenance. Finally, we found no evidence for recent selection on traits associated with lifetime reproductive success. It appears that the fitness costs of increased lifetime stressful exposures associated with warming leaves little scope for genetic adaptation in this population. These findings, together with global forecasts of abrupt exposure of species to intolerable temperature extremes5, warn that adaptive responses to warming could be the exception rather than the rule.\nEvaluating key evidence and formulating regulatory alternatives regarding the UK Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill\nAuthors: Challender, D.; 't Sas-Rolfes, M.; Dickman, A.; Hare, D.; Hart, A.; Hoffmann, M.; Mallon, D.; Mandisodza-Chikerema, R.; Roe, D.\nScore: 120.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544826\nPublic policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as \"trophy hunting\" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.\nRevisiting soil fungal biomarkers and conversion factors: Interspecific variability in phospholipid fatty acids, ergosterol and rDNA copy numbers\nAuthors: Camenzind, T.; Haslwimmer, H.; Rillig, M. C.; Ruess, L.; Finn, D. R.; Tebbe, C. C.; Hempel, S.; Marhan, S.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574151\nThe abundances of fungi and bacteria in soil are used as simple predictors for carbon dynamics, and represent widely available microbial traits. Soil biomarkers serve as quantitative estimates of these microbial groups, though not quantifying microbial biomass per se. The accurate conversion to microbial carbon pools, and an understanding of its comparability among soils is therefore needed. We refined conversion factors for classical fungal biomarkers, and evaluated the application of quantitative PCR (qPCR, rDNA copies) as a biomarker for soil fungi. Based on biomarker contents in pure fungal cultures of 30 isolates, combined with available references, we propose average conversion factors of 95.3 g fungal C g-1 ergosterol, 32.0 mg fungal C {micro}mol-1 PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and 0.264 pg fungal C ITS1 DNA copy-1. As expected, interspecific variability was most pronounced in rDNA copies, though qPCR results showed the least phylogenetic bias. A modeling approach based on exemplary agricultural soils further supported the hypothesis that high diversity in soil buffers against biomarker variability, whereas also phylogenetic biases impact the accuracy of comparisons in biomarker estimates. Our analyses suggest that qPCR results cover the fungal community in soil best, though with a variability only partly offset in highly diverse soils. PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and ergosterol represent accurate biomarkers to quantify Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To conclude, the ecological interpretation and coverage of biomarker data prior to their application in global models is important, where the combination of different biomarkers may be most insightful.\nExperimental evaluation of Eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) detectability in visual search surveys\nAuthors: Heinle, W. F.; Beswick, N.; Wapman, E.; Royle, J.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.572695\nUnderstanding how detection probability varies over time, space, or in response to measurable covariates is important to inform the monitoring and assessment of many species. A standard model to understand detectability - the availability/perception model - admits that detection probability is the composite of two components: availability and perception. Availability is largely affected by environmental and behavioral factors, whereas perception is primarily affected by attributes of individual observers and survey protocols, and thus can potentially be partially controlled by survey design. We designed and implemented a field study to understand the perception component of detection for Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) using visual encounter surveys. We obtained and deployed museum specimens of Eastern box turtle shells and subjected them to visual search surveys by observers in realistic field situations. Overall, about 50% of the box turtle shells were detected by observers including, 41.5% in the partially visible state and 63% in the fully visible state. There were significant differences among observers, which may be due to observer-specific variation in search technique -- the observers varied in how well they achieved the protocol guidance.\nWildCLIP: Scene and animal attribute retrieval from camera trap data with domain-adapted vision-language models\nAuthors: Gabeff, V.; Russwurm, M.; Tuia, D.; Mathis, A.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572990\nWildlife observation with camera traps has great potential for ethology and ecology, as it gathers data non-invasively in an automated way. However, camera traps produce large amounts of uncurated data, which is time-consuming to annotate. Existing methods to label these data automatically commonly use a fixed pre-defined set of distinctive classes and require many labeled examples per class to be trained. Moreover, the attributes of interest are sometimes rare and difficult to find in large data collections. Large pretrained vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), offer great promises to facilitate the annotation process of camera-trap data. Images can be described with greater detail, the set of classes is not fixed and can be extensible on demand and pretrained models can help to retrieve rare samples. In this work, we explore the potential of CLIP to retrieve images according to environmental and ecological attributes. We create WildCLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on wildlife camera-trap images and to further increase its flexibility, we add an adapter module to better expand to novel attributes in a few-shot manner. We quantify WildCLIPs performance and show that it can retrieve novel attributes in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our findings outline new opportunities to facilitate annotation processes with complex and multi-attribute captions. The code will be made available at https://github.com/amathislab/wildclip.\nHow much warming can mosquito vectors tolerate?\nAuthors: Couper, L.; Desire Uwera Nalukwago, D.; Lyberger, K.; Farner, J.; Mordecai, E. A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574109\nWhile climate warming is expected to substantially impact the global landscape of mosquito-borne disease, impacts will vary across disease systems and regions. Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins - the difference between an organisms upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 12 major mosquito species (including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae) that are the major vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that most mosquito vector species have large positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their range, when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. For species with distributions spanning both hemispheres, we find the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, just south of the equator, as well as at their northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability in the subtropics. Underlying these broad scale patterns, we find clear biogeographical differences in vector thermal safety with regions such as the Middle East, India, northwestern Africa, southeastern Australia, and the southwestern U.S., and desert and xeric shrubland biomes having the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.\nHierarchical Ordination, A unifying framework for drivers of community processes\nAuthors: O'Hara, R. B.; van der Veen, B.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574701\nOrdination methods have been used by community ecologists to describe and explore the communities they sample by reducing this variation down to a small number of dimensions. More recently, Joint Species Distribution Models have been developed to model and predict the distributions of several species simultaneously. Contemporary models for the data for both of these problems are essentially the same, called Generalised Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVMs). Based on this we suggest some avenues of cross-fertilisation between the two areas of research. We also describe some of the extensions to GLLVMs, and from this suggest the development of Hierarchical Ordination, as a way of efficiently modelling communities of species in space.\nEcological histories determine the success of social exploitation\nAuthors: Schaal, K. A.; Manhes, P.; Velicer, G. J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571652\nEcological context often modifies biotic interactions, yet effects of ecological history are poorly understood. In experiments with the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, resource-level histories of genotypes interacting during cooperative multicellular development were found to strongly regulate social fitness. Yet how developmental spore production responded to variation in resource-level histories between interactants differed greatly between cooperators and cheaters; relative-fitness advantages gained by cheating after high-resource growth were generally reduced or absent if one or both parties experienced low-resource growth. Low-resource growth also eliminated facultative exploitation in some pairwise mixes of cooperation-proficient natural isolates that occurs when both strains have grown under resource abundance. Our results contrast with previous studies in which cooperator fitness correlated positively with resource level and suggest that resource-level variation may be important in regulating whether exploitation of cooperators occurs in a natural context.\nUsing FINDeM for rapid, CRISPR-based detection of the emerging salamandrid fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans.\nAuthors: Hoenig, B. D.; Boning, P.; Plewnia, A.; Richards-Zawacki, C. L.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.573879\nThe fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is one of two species (the other, B. dendrobatidis/Bd) that cause amphibian chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease that has been indicated in the declines of hundreds of amphibian species worldwide. While Bd has been near-globally distributed for well over a century, Bsal is a more recently emerged pathogen, having been identified just over a decade ago with current impacts localized to salamandrids in parts of Europe. However, because there is concern that Bsal will cause widespread declines if introduced to naive regions - such as the Americas where the greatest diversity of salamandrids exist - it is imperative that widespread testing and monitoring strategies be implemented to mitigate the spread of Bsal. As standard diagnostic approaches tend to be expensive, time-consuming, or require specialized instrumentation and training, we have developed a simplified, rapid, CRISPR-based approach for Bsal-DNA identification and provide suggestions for its future application.\nHormetic effect induced by Beauveria bassiana in Myzus persicae\nAuthors: Arinanto, L. S.; Hoffmann, A. A.; Ross, P. A.; Gu, X.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574279\nMyzus persicae, a serious sap-sucking pest of a large variety of host plants in agriculture, is traditionally controlled using chemical insecticides but there is interest in using biopesticides as restrictions are increasingly placed on the use of broad-spectrum pesticides. Here we show that in petri dish experiments high concentrations of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (strain PRRI 5336) lead to rapid mortality of M. persicae but at a low concentration (1 x 104 conidia mL-1) there is a hormetic effect where longevity and fecundity are enhanced. Hormetic effects persisted across a generation with reduced development times and increased fecundity in the offspring of M. persicae exposed to B. bassiana. Whole plant experiments point to a hormetic effect being detected in two out of three tested lines. The impact of these effects might also depend on whether M. persicae was transinfected with the endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis, which decreases fecundity and survival compared to aphids lacking this endosymbiont. This fecundity cost was ameliorated in the generation following exposure to the entomopathogen. While B. bassiana is effective in controlling M. persicae especially at higher spore concentrations, utilization of this entomopathogen requires careful consideration of hormetic effects at lower spore concentrations, and further research to optimize its application for sustainable agriculture is recommended. AUTHOR SUMMARYBiopesticides such as Beauveria bassiana can be effective alternatives to chemical insecticides to control insect pests. We tested the efficacy of this biopesticide against the important agricultural pest aphid Myzus persicae in laboratory experiments. We also tested whether the potential biological control agent and endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis could provide protection against mortality caused by B. bassiana. While high doses of B. bassiana caused rapid mortality in aphids, low doses enhanced aphid fecundity and survival. This enhancement persisted into the next generation, with shortened development times and increased fecundity regardless, even when high doses were used in the previous generation. The endosymbiont R. viridis did not provide clear protection against B. bassiana, in contrast to previous studies in other aphid species, but beneficial effects at low doses also occurred in this aphid line. We also observed hormesis on experiments on whole plants, but only for some aphid genotypes. To a lesser extent, we also observed beneficial effects of low doses of B. bassiana in experiments on whole plants, but only in some aphid genotypes. Fitness enhancement by biopesticides at low doses raises concerns for field applications but further research is required to understand its underlying mechanisms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Rapid climate change is expected to impose strong selective pressures on wild populations, disrupting evolved life history strategies and limiting population viability1. The magnitude and pace at which environments will change means the persistence of wild populations will depend substantially on their ability to adapt genetically. However, we know very little about the capacity for evolutionary change in response to the rapid pace and predicted magnitude of warming. The Arctic is the fastest warming region on the planet2, so that is where we can first address this knowledge gap. Using estimates of epigenetic age acceleration, which indicate the accumulation of stress exposures across lifetimes3,4, we found polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay, Canada aged one year faster on average for each degree Celsius of temperature rise they experienced. As predicted by established theory, age acceleration was associated with reproducing early, a trait that prior to the onset of rapid warming, increased lifetime reproductive success for bears. However, the fitness benefit of early reproduction eroded with increased warming, reflecting a redirection of energy away from reproduction toward maintenance. Finally, we found no evidence for recent selection on traits associated with lifetime reproductive success. It appears that the fitness costs of increased lifetime stressful exposures associated with warming leaves little scope for genetic adaptation in this population. These findings, together with global forecasts of abrupt exposure of species to intolerable temperature extremes5, warn that adaptive responses to warming could be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Public policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as &#34;trophy hunting&#34; is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {&#43;/-} 66.53 (mean {&#43;/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {&#43;/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The abundances of fungi and bacteria in soil are used as simple predictors for carbon dynamics, and represent widely available microbial traits. Soil biomarkers serve as quantitative estimates of these microbial groups, though not quantifying microbial biomass per se. The accurate conversion to microbial carbon pools, and an understanding of its comparability among soils is therefore needed. We refined conversion factors for classical fungal biomarkers, and evaluated the application of quantitative PCR (qPCR, rDNA copies) as a biomarker for soil fungi. Based on biomarker contents in pure fungal cultures of 30 isolates, combined with available references, we propose average conversion factors of 95.3 g fungal C g-1 ergosterol, 32.0 mg fungal C {micro}mol-1 PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and 0.264 pg fungal C ITS1 DNA copy-1. As expected, interspecific variability was most pronounced in rDNA copies, though qPCR results showed the least phylogenetic bias. A modeling approach based on exemplary agricultural soils further supported the hypothesis that high diversity in soil buffers against biomarker variability, whereas also phylogenetic biases impact the accuracy of comparisons in biomarker estimates. Our analyses suggest that qPCR results cover the fungal community in soil best, though with a variability only partly offset in highly diverse soils. PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and ergosterol represent accurate biomarkers to quantify Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To conclude, the ecological interpretation and coverage of biomarker data prior to their application in global models is important, where the combination of different biomarkers may be most insightful.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how detection probability varies over time, space, or in response to measurable covariates is important to inform the monitoring and assessment of many species. A standard model to understand detectability - the availability/perception model - admits that detection probability is the composite of two components: availability and perception. Availability is largely affected by environmental and behavioral factors, whereas perception is primarily affected by attributes of individual observers and survey protocols, and thus can potentially be partially controlled by survey design. We designed and implemented a field study to understand the perception component of detection for Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) using visual encounter surveys. We obtained and deployed museum specimens of Eastern box turtle shells and subjected them to visual search surveys by observers in realistic field situations. Overall, about 50% of the box turtle shells were detected by observers including, 41.5% in the  partially visible state and 63% in the  fully visible state. There were significant differences among observers, which may be due to observer-specific variation in search technique -- the observers varied in how well they achieved the protocol guidance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wildlife observation with camera traps has great potential for ethology and ecology, as it gathers data non-invasively in an automated way. However, camera traps produce large amounts of uncurated data, which is time-consuming to annotate. Existing methods to label these data automatically commonly use a fixed pre-defined set of distinctive classes and require many labeled examples per class to be trained. Moreover, the attributes of interest are sometimes rare and difficult to find in large data collections. Large pretrained vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), offer great promises to facilitate the annotation process of camera-trap data. Images can be described with greater detail, the set of classes is not fixed and can be extensible on demand and pretrained models can help to retrieve rare samples. In this work, we explore the potential of CLIP to retrieve images according to environmental and ecological attributes. We create WildCLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on wildlife camera-trap images and to further increase its flexibility, we add an adapter module to better expand to novel attributes in a few-shot manner. We quantify WildCLIPs performance and show that it can retrieve novel attributes in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our findings outline new opportunities to facilitate annotation processes with complex and multi-attribute captions. The code will be made available at https://github.com/amathislab/wildclip.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While climate warming is expected to substantially impact the global landscape of mosquito-borne disease, impacts will vary across disease systems and regions. Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins - the difference between an organisms upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 12 major mosquito species (including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae) that are the major vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that most mosquito vector species have large positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their range, when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. For species with distributions spanning both hemispheres, we find the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, just south of the equator, as well as at their northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability in the subtropics. Underlying these broad scale patterns, we find clear biogeographical differences in vector thermal safety with regions such as the Middle East, India, northwestern Africa, southeastern Australia, and the southwestern U.S., and desert and xeric shrubland biomes having the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ordination methods have been used by community ecologists to describe and explore the communities they sample by reducing this variation down to a small number of dimensions. More recently, Joint Species Distribution Models have been developed to model and predict the distributions of several species simultaneously. Contemporary models for the data for both of these problems are essentially the same, called Generalised Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVMs). Based on this we suggest some avenues of cross-fertilisation between the two areas of research. We also describe some of the extensions to GLLVMs, and from this suggest the development of Hierarchical Ordination, as a way of efficiently modelling communities of species in space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecological context often modifies biotic interactions, yet effects of ecological history are poorly understood. In experiments with the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, resource-level histories of genotypes interacting during cooperative multicellular development were found to strongly regulate social fitness. Yet how developmental spore production responded to variation in resource-level histories between interactants differed greatly between cooperators and cheaters; relative-fitness advantages gained by cheating after high-resource growth were generally reduced or absent if one or both parties experienced low-resource growth. Low-resource growth also eliminated facultative exploitation in some pairwise mixes of cooperation-proficient natural isolates that occurs when both strains have grown under resource abundance. Our results contrast with previous studies in which cooperator fitness correlated positively with resource level and suggest that resource-level variation may be important in regulating whether exploitation of cooperators occurs in a natural context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is one of two species (the other, B. dendrobatidis/Bd) that cause amphibian chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease that has been indicated in the declines of hundreds of amphibian species worldwide. While Bd has been near-globally distributed for well over a century, Bsal is a more recently emerged pathogen, having been identified just over a decade ago with current impacts localized to salamandrids in parts of Europe. However, because there is concern that Bsal will cause widespread declines if introduced to naive regions - such as the Americas where the greatest diversity of salamandrids exist - it is imperative that widespread testing and monitoring strategies be implemented to mitigate the spread of Bsal. As standard diagnostic approaches tend to be expensive, time-consuming, or require specialized instrumentation and training, we have developed a simplified, rapid, CRISPR-based approach for Bsal-DNA identification and provide suggestions for its future application.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myzus persicae, a serious sap-sucking pest of a large variety of host plants in agriculture, is traditionally controlled using chemical insecticides but there is interest in using biopesticides as restrictions are increasingly placed on the use of broad-spectrum pesticides. Here we show that in petri dish experiments high concentrations of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (strain PRRI 5336) lead to rapid mortality of M. persicae but at a low concentration (1 x 104 conidia mL-1) there is a hormetic effect where longevity and fecundity are enhanced. Hormetic effects persisted across a generation with reduced development times and increased fecundity in the offspring of M. persicae exposed to B. bassiana. Whole plant experiments point to a hormetic effect being detected in two out of three tested lines. The impact of these effects might also depend on whether M. persicae was transinfected with the endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis, which decreases fecundity and survival compared to aphids lacking this endosymbiont. This fecundity cost was ameliorated in the generation following exposure to the entomopathogen. While B. bassiana is effective in controlling M. persicae especially at higher spore concentrations, utilization of this entomopathogen requires careful consideration of hormetic effects at lower spore concentrations, and further research to optimize its application for sustainable agriculture is recommended.

AUTHOR SUMMARYBiopesticides such as Beauveria bassiana can be effective alternatives to chemical insecticides to control insect pests. We tested the efficacy of this biopesticide against the important agricultural pest aphid Myzus persicae in laboratory experiments. We also tested whether the potential biological control agent and endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis could provide protection against mortality caused by B. bassiana. While high doses of B. bassiana caused rapid mortality in aphids, low doses enhanced aphid fecundity and survival. This enhancement persisted into the next generation, with shortened development times and increased fecundity regardless, even when high doses were used in the previous generation. The endosymbiont R. viridis did not provide clear protection against B. bassiana, in contrast to previous studies in other aphid species, but beneficial effects at low doses also occurred in this aphid line. We also observed hormesis on experiments on whole plants, but only for some aphid genotypes. To a lesser extent, we also observed beneficial effects of low doses of B. bassiana in experiments on whole plants, but only in some aphid genotypes. Fitness enhancement by biopesticides at low doses raises concerns for field applications but further research is required to understand its underlying mechanisms.</p>
