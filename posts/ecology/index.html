A potential driver of variation in diversity-productivity relationships is the biogeographical context, which may alter these relationships via processes acting on the size and composition of the species pool like dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, speciation, and invasibility. However, the extent to which the relationships between biodiversity facets and forest productivity are shaped by the biogeographic context remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effects of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional tree diversity on aboveground productivity in climatically similar forests on islands and mainland. LocationContinental and insular Spain. Time period1997-2018. Major taxa studiedTrees. MethodsUsing plot data from a national forest inventory, we assessed the influence of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity on aboveground productivity using linear models and structural equation models, while accounting for environmental conditions, non-native species, and the number of trees. ResultsWe find that drier environmental conditions lead to a decrease in productivity and in the number of trees in both island and mainland forests. In island forests, non-native species increased productivity directly and via their effects on phylogenetic diversity. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that multifaceted diversity, by capturing the diversity of evolutionary history, contributes to elucidating diversity-productivity relationships in island forests that could not be detected otherwise by taxonomic diversity alone. By filling empty niches in island forests, we find that non-native species are fundamentally altering ecosystem functioning on islands.\nA fast-slow trait continuum at the level of entire communities\nAuthors: Neyret, M.; Le Provost, G.; Boesing, A.

However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for \u003e2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that slow and fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.\nTar patties are hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover and nitrogen fixation during a nearshore pollution event in the oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea\nAuthors: Rubin-Blum, M.; Yudkovsky, Y.; Marmen, S.; Raveh, O.; Amrani, A.; Kutuzov, I.; Guy-Haim, T.; Rahav, E.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.546273\nWeathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.

Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificacao Florestal e Agricola (IMAFLORA) near Sao Felix do Xingu, in Para, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called TerraBio. Our results suggest that, due to IMAFLORAs shaded cocoa projects, over 400 acres were restored in the intervention area and the community composition of arthropods in shaded cocoa is closer to second-growth forests than that of pastures. In reviewing the coupled approach, we found multiple aspects worked well, and we conclude by presenting multiple lessons learned.\nStructured demographic buffering: A framework to explore the environment drivers and demographic mechanisms underlying demographic buffering\nAuthors: Gascoigne, S.

C.; Jaggi, H.; Sepil, I.; Salguero-Gomez, R.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549848\nEnvironmental stochasticity is a key determinant of population viability. Decades of work exploring how environmental stochasticity influences population dynamics have highlighted the ability of some natural populations to limit the negative effects of environmental stochasticity, one of these strategies being demographic buffering. Whilst various methods exist to quantify demographic buffering, we still do not know which environment factors and demographic characteristics are most responsible for the demographic buffering observed in natural populations. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the relative effects of three key drivers of demographic buffering: environment components (e.g., temporal autocorrelation and variance), population structure, and demographic rates (e.g., progression and fertility). Using Integral Projection Models, we explore how these drivers impact the demographic buffering abilities of three plant species with different life histories and demonstrate how our approach successfully characterises a populations capacity to demographically buffer against environmental stochasticity in a changing world.\nOdor source location can be predicted from a time-history of odor statistics for a large-scale outdoor plume\nAuthors: Nag, A.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549973\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOdor plumes in turbulent environments are intermittent and sparse, yet many animals effectively navigate to odor sources to find food [1]. Computational and lab-scaled experiments [2, 3, 4] have suggested that information about the source distance may be encoded in odor signal statistics, yet it is unclear whether useful and continuous distance estimates can be made under real-world flow conditions. Here we analyze odor signals from outdoor experiments with a sensor moving across large spatial scales in desert and forest environments to show that odor signal statistics can yield useful estimates of distance. The probability distribution of statistics from individual whiffs (contiguous odor sequences) are correlated with distance, but their correlation coefficient is poor. However, we show that a useful estimate of distance can be found by incorporating whiff statistics from time history of [~]10-seconds, resulting in a strong correlation of R2 [~]0.70. We identified whiff concentration and duration to be the most informative features. By combining distance estimates from a linear model with wind-relative motion dynamics, we were able to estimate source distance in a 60x60 m2 area with median errors of 3-8 meters, a distance at which point odor sources are within visual range for animals such as mosquitoes [5, 6]. Finally, we show that such estimates are only feasible if odor signal information is recorded at temporal resolutions of[\u0026ge;] 20 Hz. Together, our results provide a compelling case for how odor signal statistics could be used by animals, or man-made machines, to optimize plume tracking decisions at large spatial scales with natural wind.\nFungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana - Diversity, functions, and publicly available cultures for experimental exploration\nAuthors: Estermann, A. H.; Teixeira Pereira Bassiardis, J.; Loos, A.; Solbach, M. D.; Bonkowski, M.; Hess, S.; Dumack, K.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548669\nIn the context of the soil food web, the transfer of plant-fixed energy and carbon to higher trophic levels has traditionally been attributed to two main energy channels: the fungal energy channel and the bacterial energy channel. Historically, protists were overlooked in the fungal energy channel, which was believed to be controlled by fungivorous microarthropods and nematodes. In this study, we investigated fungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings revealed a notable abundance and diversity of protists that have developed specialized strategies to overcome the protective cell wall of fungi. Among the identified species were two Vampyrellida (Rhizaria) species, namely Theratromyxa weberi and Platyreta germanica, as well as one Arcellinida (Amoebozoa) species, called Cryptodifflugia oviformis. While T. weberi typically consumed entire fungal cells, the other two species perforated fungal cell walls and extracted the cellular contents. We elucidate the feeding strategies and dietary ranges of the amoebae, highlighting the non-uniform nature of fungivory in protists, as different taxa have evolved distinct approaches to access fungi as a food source. Moreover, we provide publicly available cultures of these protists to facilitate further experimental investigations within the research community.\nContrasting Patterns of Pierce's Disease Risk in European Vineyards Under Global Warming\nAuthors: Gimenez-Romero, A.; Iturbide, M.; Moralejo, E.; Gutierrez, J. M.; Matias, M. A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549293\nPierces Disease (PD) is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which poses a significant threat to grapevines worldwide. Despite its importance, the risk of future PD establishment in Europe remains unclear due to previous incomplete methodologies followed by conflicting results. Here we present a comprehensive approach considering the compound effect of climate change on the pathosystem. Within the general trend of progressively increasing PD risk, we identified the +3{o}C scenario as a turning point for potential spreading beyond Mediterranean regions, representing a serious risk for French and Italian viticulture. Our innovative methodology reveals PD risk as a multi-factor multi-scale process, showing contrasting spatial patterns and different risk velocities across regions, as well as a high timing uncertainty. By overcoming previous limitations, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential spread of PD in Europe, supporting informed decision-making for disease management and prevention.\nThe Lion's Share: Implications of carnivore diet on endangered herbivores in Tsavo\nAuthors: King, E.; Chakrabarti, S.; Lala, F.; Nyaga, S.; Waiguchu, G.; Chiyo, P.

An understanding of predator diet can therefore provide crucial information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected between 2019 and 2023, coupled with estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized lion prey-consumption and preference in Tsavo, Kenya. A lion-specific biomass model applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that more than 85% of lion diet consisted of large ungulates weighing over 150 kg. While large ungulates were also preferred prey items in terms of their availability, we found a disproportionately high consumption and preference of lions for the endangered hirola and Grevys zebra-- species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex-situ conservation programs. Hirola and Grevys zebra populations have historically remained small in Tsavo despite strong recovery efforts, and our results likely indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on these small but crucial populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap hirola and Grevys zebra within a predator-pit. Our findings have strong implications for understanding lion diet, optimal foraging, and the potential effects predators have on endangered prey species in a landscape of critical conservation importance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">AimGrowing evidence suggests that impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and natures contributions to people are usually negative, yet the magnitude and direction of these impacts can be variable across naturally-assembled ecosystems. A potential driver of variation in diversity-productivity relationships is the biogeographical context, which may alter these relationships via processes acting on the size and composition of the species pool like dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, speciation, and invasibility. However, the extent to which the relationships between biodiversity facets and forest productivity are shaped by the biogeographic context remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effects of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional tree diversity on aboveground productivity in climatically similar forests on islands and mainland.

LocationContinental and insular Spain.

Time period1997-2018.

Major taxa studiedTrees.

MethodsUsing plot data from a national forest inventory, we assessed the influence of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity on aboveground productivity using linear models and structural equation models, while accounting for environmental conditions, non-native species, and the number of trees.

ResultsWe find that drier environmental conditions lead to a decrease in productivity and in the number of trees in both island and mainland forests. In island forests, non-native species increased productivity directly and via their effects on phylogenetic diversity.

Main conclusionsOur results suggest that multifaceted diversity, by capturing the diversity of evolutionary history, contributes to elucidating diversity-productivity relationships in island forests that could not be detected otherwise by taxonomic diversity alone. By filling empty niches in island forests, we find that non-native species are fundamentally altering ecosystem functioning on islands.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Across the tree of life, organismal functional strategies form a continuum from slow-to fast-growing organisms, in response to common drivers such as resource availability and disturbance. However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for &gt;2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a  slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that  slow and  fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Weathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.

        <p class="abstract">In a recently published paper (1), the authors report that microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is the primary determinant of global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and that the relative impact of plant carbon inputs on SOC is minor. While soil microbes undoubtedly play an important role in soil organic carbon cycling, we are concerned about the robustness of the approach taken by Tao et al. (1) and highlight potential biases in their analyses that may lead to misleading, model-dependent results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring is essential to ensure that environmental goals are being achieved, including those of sustainable agriculture. Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificacao Florestal e Agricola (IMAFLORA) near Sao Felix do Xingu, in Para, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called TerraBio. Our results suggest that, due to IMAFLORAs shaded cocoa projects, over 400 acres were restored in the intervention area and the community composition of arthropods in shaded cocoa is closer to second-growth forests than that of pastures. In reviewing the coupled approach, we found multiple aspects worked well, and we conclude by presenting multiple lessons learned.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental stochasticity is a key determinant of population viability. Decades of work exploring how environmental stochasticity influences population dynamics have highlighted the ability of some natural populations to limit the negative effects of environmental stochasticity, one of these strategies being demographic buffering. Whilst various methods exist to quantify demographic buffering, we still do not know which environment factors and demographic characteristics are most responsible for the demographic buffering observed in natural populations. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the relative effects of three key drivers of demographic buffering: environment components (e.g., temporal autocorrelation and variance), population structure, and demographic rates (e.g., progression and fertility). Using Integral Projection Models, we explore how these drivers impact the demographic buffering abilities of three plant species with different life histories and demonstrate how our approach successfully characterises a populations capacity to demographically buffer against environmental stochasticity in a changing world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOdor plumes in turbulent environments are intermittent and sparse, yet many animals effectively navigate to odor sources to find food [1]. Computational and lab-scaled experiments [2, 3, 4] have suggested that information about the source distance may be encoded in odor signal statistics, yet it is unclear whether useful and continuous distance estimates can be made under real-world flow conditions. Here we analyze odor signals from outdoor experiments with a sensor moving across large spatial scales in desert and forest environments to show that odor signal statistics can yield useful estimates of distance. The probability distribution of statistics from individual whiffs (contiguous odor sequences) are correlated with distance, but their correlation coefficient is poor. However, we show that a useful estimate of distance can be found by incorporating whiff statistics from time history of [~]10-seconds, resulting in a strong correlation of R2 [~]0.70. We identified whiff concentration and duration to be the most informative features. By combining distance estimates from a linear model with wind-relative motion dynamics, we were able to estimate source distance in a 60x60 m2 area with median errors of 3-8 meters, a distance at which point odor sources are within visual range for animals such as mosquitoes [5, 6]. Finally, we show that such estimates are only feasible if odor signal information is recorded at temporal resolutions of[&amp;ge;] 20 Hz. Together, our results provide a compelling case for how odor signal statistics could be used by animals, or man-made machines, to optimize plume tracking decisions at large spatial scales with natural wind.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the context of the soil food web, the transfer of plant-fixed energy and carbon to higher trophic levels has traditionally been attributed to two main energy channels: the fungal energy channel and the bacterial energy channel. Historically, protists were overlooked in the fungal energy channel, which was believed to be controlled by fungivorous microarthropods and nematodes. In this study, we investigated fungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings revealed a notable abundance and diversity of protists that have developed specialized strategies to overcome the protective cell wall of fungi. Among the identified species were two Vampyrellida (Rhizaria) species, namely Theratromyxa weberi and Platyreta germanica, as well as one Arcellinida (Amoebozoa) species, called Cryptodifflugia oviformis. While T. weberi typically consumed entire fungal cells, the other two species perforated fungal cell walls and extracted the cellular contents. We elucidate the feeding strategies and dietary ranges of the amoebae, highlighting the non-uniform nature of fungivory in protists, as different taxa have evolved distinct approaches to access fungi as a food source. Moreover, we provide publicly available cultures of these protists to facilitate further experimental investigations within the research community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pierces Disease (PD) is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which poses a significant threat to grapevines worldwide. Despite its importance, the risk of future PD establishment in Europe remains unclear due to previous incomplete methodologies followed by conflicting results. Here we present a comprehensive approach considering the compound effect of climate change on the pathosystem. Within the general trend of progressively increasing PD risk, we identified the &#43;3{o}C scenario as a turning point for potential spreading beyond Mediterranean regions, representing a serious risk for French and Italian viticulture. Our innovative methodology reveals PD risk as a multi-factor multi-scale process, showing contrasting spatial patterns and different risk velocities across regions, as well as a high timing uncertainty. By overcoming previous limitations, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential spread of PD in Europe, supporting informed decision-making for disease management and prevention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predation by mammalian carnivores can have cascading, regulatory effects across ecological communities. An understanding of predator diet can therefore provide crucial information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected between 2019 and 2023, coupled with estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized lion prey-consumption and preference in Tsavo, Kenya. A lion-specific biomass model applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that more than 85% of lion diet consisted of large ungulates weighing over 150 kg. While large ungulates were also preferred prey items in terms of their availability, we found a disproportionately high consumption and preference of lions for the endangered hirola and Grevys zebra-- species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex-situ conservation programs. Hirola and Grevys zebra populations have historically remained small in Tsavo despite strong recovery efforts, and our results likely indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on these small but crucial populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap hirola and Grevys zebra within a predator-pit. Our findings have strong implications for understanding lion diet, optimal foraging, and the potential effects predators have on endangered prey species in a landscape of critical conservation importance.</p>
