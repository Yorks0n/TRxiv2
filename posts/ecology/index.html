Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.

Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.\nSediment source and dose influence the larval performance of the threatened coral Orbicella faveolata\nAuthors: Serrano, X.; Rosales, S. M.; Miller, M. W.; Palacio-Castro, A. M.; Williamson, O. M.; Gomez, A.; Baker, A. C.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559035\nThe effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.\nEvaluating goodness-of-fit of animal movement models using lineups\nAuthors: Fieberg, J.; Signer, J.; Freeman, S.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559591\nModels of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.\nEvaluating the definition and distribution of spring ephemeral wildflowers in eastern North America\nAuthors: Yancy, A. J.; Lee, B. R.; Kuebbing, S. E.; Neufeld, H. S.; Spicer, M. E.; Heberling, J. M.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560873\nThe herbaceous layer accounts for the majority of plant biodiversity in eastern North American forests, encompassing substantial variation in life history strategy and function. One group of early season herbaceous understory species, colloquially referred to as \"spring ephemeral wildflowers\", are of particular ecological and cultural importance. Despite this, little is known about the prevalence and biogeographic patterns of the spring ephemeral strategy. Here, we used georeferenced and dated observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to define the phenological strategies of 559 herbaceous, vascular, understory plant species in eastern North America from a composite species list encompassing 16 site-level species lists ranging from Georgia to southern Canada. Specifically, we estimated activity periods from regional observations (primarily consisting of citizen scientist iNaturalist observations) and classified species as ephemeral if they completed all aboveground activity (including leafing, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) prior to an estimated date of canopy closure derived from remote-sensed data. We then evaluated the richness of these species at the landscape scale using estimates of biogeographic and environmental drivers aggregated for 100 km x 100 km grid cells. Importantly, our spatially-explicit approach defines each species' spring ephemerality along a continuous scale (which we call the Ephemerality Index, EI) based on the proportion of its range in which it senesces before canopy closure (with EI = 0 indicating a species that is never ephemeral and EI = 1 indicating a species that is always ephemeral). We found that 18.4% (103 species) of understory wildflowers exhibited spring ephemerality in at least part of their range, with only 3.4% of all species exhibiting ephemeral behavior in all parts of their range. Ephemeral species had higher overall richness and composed a higher proportion of understory biodiversity in low-elevation areas with intermediate spring temperatures and elevated spring precipitation. Spring ephemerals peaked in both absolute species richness and relative proportion at mid latitudes. These biogeographic patterns deserve further study in other regions of the world and to uncover mechanisms behind these patterns. Using our new metric, our results demonstrate that the spring ephemeral strategy is not a discrete category, but rather a continuum that can vary across species' ranges.\nA tipping point in West Antarctica in 2023's circumpolar 5-sigma event? a glimpse from the emperor penguin's perspective\nAuthors: Kruger, L.; Vianna, J. A.; Le Bohec, C.; Cardenas, C. A.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559910\nEmperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.\nOrchards and paddy differentially impact rock outcrop amphibians: Insights from community- and species-level responses\nAuthors: Jithin, V.; Rane, M.; Watve, A.; Naniwadekar, R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560737\nWith agricultural demands increasing globally, determining the nature of impacts of different forms of agriculture on biodiversity, especially for threatened vertebrates and habitats, is critical to inform land management. We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.\nEcology and not phylogeny influences sensitivity to climate change in Muscicapidae Flycatchers in Eastern Himalayan and Indo-Burman hotspots\nAuthors: Dhanda, A.; Jezierski, M. T.; Coulson, T.; Clegg, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561030\nAims: Species' distributional responses to climate change can depend on ecology and phylogeny. The degree of habitat specialism is potentially important because habitat generalists with wider distributions are assumed to be less sensitive to environmental changes compared to narrowly-distributed habitat specialists. Additionally, predicting which aspects of the changing climate impacts species with different habitat associations may be particularly challenging in complex environments such as those of tropical mountains. We explore the effects of climate change on potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers in parts of the Eastern Himalayan Mountains and the Indo-Burman range, and relate predictions to the level of ecological habitat specialism, while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Location: Bhutan and Northeast India. Methods: We used Maxent to develop ecological niche models of 60 Muscicapidae Flycatchers under different climatic scenarios by collating presences from Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, and elevation from ASTER. Species were scored as habitat specialists or generalists using the Species Specialism Index. Variables with high contributions to Maxent models were extracted to explore sensitivity to climate change based on habitat specialism while testing for phylogenetic signal using Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares. Results: Maxent models had the highest contributions from variable bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter) under present climate, and tmax (maximum temperature) under future climatic scenarios. Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares revealed that habitat generalists had higher sensitivity to climate change than specialists. We did not detect strong phylogenetic signal in sensitivity to abiotic variables under all climate scenarios. Main conclusions: Potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers were sensitive to temperature variable in the month of the highest precipitation, and to maximum temperature. Potential distributions of habitat generalists were particularly sensitive to these abiotic variables, and those of habitat specialists less so. Sensitivity to abiotic variables did not show a pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism.\nEcological metabolomics of tropical tree communities across an elevational gradient: Implications for chemically-mediated biotic interactions and species diversity\nAuthors: Henderson, D.; Sedio, B. E.; Tello, J. S.; Cayola, L.; Fuentes, A. F.; Alvestegui, B.; Muchhala, N.; Myers, J. A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560880\nSeminal hypotheses in ecology and evolution postulate that stronger and more specialized biotic interactions contribute to higher species diversity at lower elevations and latitudes. Plant-chemical defenses mediate biotic interactions between plants and their natural enemies and provide a highly dimensional trait space in which chemically mediated niches may facilitate plant species coexistence. However, the role of chemically mediated biotic interactions in shaping plant communities remains largely untested across large-scale ecological gradients. To test this hypothesis, we used ecological metabolomics to quantify the chemical dissimilarity of foliar metabolomes among 473 tree species (906 unique species-plot combinations) in 16 tropical tree communities along an elevational gradient in Madidi National Park, Bolivia. We predicted that chemical dissimilarity among co-occurring tree species would be greater, and chemical phylogenetic signal lower, in communities with greater tree species richness and warmer, wetter, and less-seasonal climates, as pressure from natural enemies is likely to be greater in these locales. Further, we predicted that these relationships should be especially pronounced for secondary metabolites derived from biosynthetic pathways known to include anti-herbivore and antimicrobial defenses than for primary metabolites. We found that median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to all metabolites and secondary metabolites increased with tree species richness, decreased with elevation, and increased along a principal component of climatic variation that reflected increasing temperature and precipitation and decreasing seasonality. In contrast, median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to primary metabolites was unrelated to tree species richness, elevation, or the principal component of climatic variation. Furthermore, phylogenetic signal of secondary and primary metabolites decreased with tree species richness. Among tree communities in moist forests, phylogenetic signal of secondary metabolites also increased with elevation and decreased with the temperature and precipitation. Our results support the hypothesis that chemically mediated biotic interactions shape elevational diversity gradients by imposing stronger selection for interspecific divergence in plant chemical defenses in warmer, wetter, and more stable climates. Our study also illustrates the promise of ecological metabolomics in the study of biogeography, community ecology, and complex species interactions in high-diversity ecosystems.\nConsequences of directly- and indirectly-experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment\nAuthors: Feugere, L.; Silva de Freitas, C.; Bates, A.; Storey, K. B.; Beltran-Alvarez, P.; Valero, K. C. W.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560724\nClimate change increases the frequency and duration of heat events. Negative effects of heat stress may be exacerbated through the action of social metabolites between aquatic animals. Whilst early life stages are vulnerable to stress-induced damage, they deploy cellular mechanisms to protect cells against mutagens such as ultraviolet rays (UV). Little is known about the fate of fish embryos which have experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment. The present study exposed zebrafish embryos to one of three stress history treatments consisting of direct heat stress (TS+UV), the social context of heat stress via social metabolites (SM+UV), and their combination in TS+SM+UV before a UVB/UVA damage/repair assay. We measured phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to these treatments, and estimated mutational damage through DNA mutation frequencies and RNA integrity values. Compared to UV-treated controls (C+UV), the social context of heat stress history preceding the UV assay altered keratin and cell structuring-related pathways, associated with longer embryos with over-developed pericardia displaying behavioural hypoactivity. Relative to C+UV, direct heat stress history preceding UV exposure had a hormetic effect by stimulating the cellular stress response and facilitating DNA repair, which rescued embryos from subsequent UV damage and improved their apparent fitness. However, heat stress combined with social metabolites overwhelmed embryos in the UV assay, which annihilated the hormetic effect, introduced mutations, and lowered their apparent fitness. Whilst generated in the laboratory, these findings provide an important baseline for understanding the consequences of heat stress history in natural environments, where heat stress occurs within a social context.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Connectivity shapes species distribution across fragmented landscapes. Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.

        <p class="abstract">Behaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Models of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The herbaceous layer accounts for the majority of plant biodiversity in eastern North American forests, encompassing substantial variation in life history strategy and function. One group of early season herbaceous understory species, colloquially referred to as &#34;spring ephemeral wildflowers&#34;, are of particular ecological and cultural importance. Despite this, little is known about the prevalence and biogeographic patterns of the spring ephemeral strategy. Here, we used georeferenced and dated observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to define the phenological strategies of 559 herbaceous, vascular, understory plant species in eastern North America from a composite species list encompassing 16 site-level species lists ranging from Georgia to southern Canada. Specifically, we estimated activity periods from regional observations (primarily consisting of citizen scientist iNaturalist observations) and classified species as ephemeral if they completed all aboveground activity (including leafing, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) prior to an estimated date of canopy closure derived from remote-sensed data. We then evaluated the richness of these species at the landscape scale using estimates of biogeographic and environmental drivers aggregated for 100 km x 100 km grid cells. Importantly, our spatially-explicit approach defines each species&#39; spring ephemerality along a continuous scale (which we call the Ephemerality Index, EI) based on the proportion of its range in which it senesces before canopy closure (with EI = 0 indicating a species that is never ephemeral and EI = 1 indicating a species that is always ephemeral). We found that 18.4% (103 species) of understory wildflowers exhibited spring ephemerality in at least part of their range, with only 3.4% of all species exhibiting ephemeral behavior in all parts of their range. Ephemeral species had higher overall richness and composed a higher proportion of understory biodiversity in low-elevation areas with intermediate spring temperatures and elevated spring precipitation. Spring ephemerals peaked in both absolute species richness and relative proportion at mid latitudes. These biogeographic patterns deserve further study in other regions of the world and to uncover mechanisms behind these patterns. Using our new metric, our results demonstrate that the spring ephemeral strategy is not a discrete category, but rather a continuum that can vary across species&#39; ranges.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With agricultural demands increasing globally, determining the nature of impacts of different forms of agriculture on biodiversity, especially for threatened vertebrates and habitats, is critical to inform land management. We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims: Species&#39; distributional responses to climate change can depend on ecology and phylogeny. The degree of habitat specialism is potentially important because habitat generalists with wider distributions are assumed to be less sensitive to environmental changes compared to narrowly-distributed habitat specialists. Additionally, predicting which aspects of the changing climate impacts species with different habitat associations may be particularly challenging in complex environments such as those of tropical mountains. We explore the effects of climate change on potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers in parts of the Eastern Himalayan Mountains and the Indo-Burman range, and relate predictions to the level of ecological habitat specialism, while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Location: Bhutan and Northeast India. Methods: We used Maxent to develop ecological niche models of 60 Muscicapidae Flycatchers under different climatic scenarios by collating presences from Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, and elevation from ASTER. Species were scored as habitat specialists or generalists using the Species Specialism Index. Variables with high contributions to Maxent models were extracted to explore sensitivity to climate change based on habitat specialism while testing for phylogenetic signal using Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares. Results: Maxent models had the highest contributions from variable bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter) under present climate, and tmax (maximum temperature) under future climatic scenarios. Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares revealed that habitat generalists had higher sensitivity to climate change than specialists. We did not detect strong phylogenetic signal in sensitivity to abiotic variables under all climate scenarios. Main conclusions: Potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers were sensitive to temperature variable in the month of the highest precipitation, and to maximum temperature. Potential distributions of habitat generalists were particularly sensitive to these abiotic variables, and those of habitat specialists less so. Sensitivity to abiotic variables did not show a pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Seminal hypotheses in ecology and evolution postulate that stronger and more specialized biotic interactions contribute to higher species diversity at lower elevations and latitudes. Plant-chemical defenses mediate biotic interactions between plants and their natural enemies and provide a highly dimensional trait space in which chemically mediated niches may facilitate plant species coexistence. However, the role of chemically mediated biotic interactions in shaping plant communities remains largely untested across large-scale ecological gradients. To test this hypothesis, we used ecological metabolomics to quantify the chemical dissimilarity of foliar metabolomes among 473 tree species (906 unique species-plot combinations) in 16 tropical tree communities along an elevational gradient in Madidi National Park, Bolivia. We predicted that chemical dissimilarity among co-occurring tree species would be greater, and chemical phylogenetic signal lower, in communities with greater tree species richness and warmer, wetter, and less-seasonal climates, as pressure from natural enemies is likely to be greater in these locales. Further, we predicted that these relationships should be especially pronounced for secondary metabolites derived from biosynthetic pathways known to include anti-herbivore and antimicrobial defenses than for primary metabolites. We found that median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to all metabolites and secondary metabolites increased with tree species richness, decreased with elevation, and increased along a principal component of climatic variation that reflected increasing temperature and precipitation and decreasing seasonality. In contrast, median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to primary metabolites was unrelated to tree species richness, elevation, or the principal component of climatic variation. Furthermore, phylogenetic signal of secondary and primary metabolites decreased with tree species richness. Among tree communities in moist forests, phylogenetic signal of secondary metabolites also increased with elevation and decreased with the temperature and precipitation. Our results support the hypothesis that chemically mediated biotic interactions shape elevational diversity gradients by imposing stronger selection for interspecific divergence in plant chemical defenses in warmer, wetter, and more stable climates. Our study also illustrates the promise of ecological metabolomics in the study of biogeography, community ecology, and complex species interactions in high-diversity ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Climate change increases the frequency and duration of heat events. Negative effects of heat stress may be exacerbated through the action of social metabolites between aquatic animals. Whilst early life stages are vulnerable to stress-induced damage, they deploy cellular mechanisms to protect cells against mutagens such as ultraviolet rays (UV). Little is known about the fate of fish embryos which have experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment. The present study exposed zebrafish embryos to one of three stress history treatments consisting of direct heat stress (TS&#43;UV), the social context of heat stress via social metabolites (SM&#43;UV), and their combination in TS&#43;SM&#43;UV before a UVB/UVA damage/repair assay. We measured phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to these treatments, and estimated mutational damage through DNA mutation frequencies and RNA integrity values. Compared to UV-treated controls (C&#43;UV), the social context of heat stress history preceding the UV assay altered keratin and cell structuring-related pathways, associated with longer embryos with over-developed pericardia displaying behavioural hypoactivity. Relative to C&#43;UV, direct heat stress history preceding UV exposure had a hormetic effect by stimulating the cellular stress response and facilitating DNA repair, which rescued embryos from subsequent UV damage and improved their apparent fitness. However, heat stress combined with social metabolites overwhelmed embryos in the UV assay, which annihilated the hormetic effect, introduced mutations, and lowered their apparent fitness. Whilst generated in the laboratory, these findings provide an important baseline for understanding the consequences of heat stress history in natural environments, where heat stress occurs within a social context.</p>
