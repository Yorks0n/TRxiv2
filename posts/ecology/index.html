The potential impact of climate change on the synchronicity of plant-insect phenology is particularly concerning since the stability of pollination networks and food chains depends on their tight temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the recently reported insect armageddon makes it urgent to establish trends and identify primary drivers of plant-insect phenological synchrony. Here, coupling high-resolution remote sensing and citizen science data across Europe over 34 years, we examine the differences in occurrence dates of 1,584 herbivorous insects across four orders and the corresponding dates of leaf unfolding. We find that 61.2% of the vegetation and insect phenologies have become highly asynchronous, with vegetation phenology advancing four-fold faster than insect phenology. These trends were modulated by insect life-cycles and taxonomic order. A primary driver of this phenological mismatch is the higher sensitivity of vegetation phenology than insect phenology to climate, which has prevented insects from matching the pace of plant phenological advance in the growing season. Our analyses provide a unique continental overview and underlying mechanisms of the asynchronicity between vegetation and insect phenologies, thus enhancing our ability to predict and manage its potential cascading ecological effects.\nInterspecific relationships in a suboptimal habitat, an unexpected ally for the survival of the threatened Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia).\nAuthors: Albaladejo Robles, G.; Escanez Perez, A.; Perera Castro, A. V.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.571074\nAnthropogenic driven environmental changes are pushing species to the limits of their habitats. More often species are restricted to relic or suboptimal habitats that present the minimum requirements to sustain species populations. In this scenario of acerated environmental change and biodiversity loss, is fundamental to understand why species are able to survive in such suboptimal conditions. In this study, we conduct an isotopic trophic analysis along with a behavioural experiment to show how novel ecological interactions allow an endangered species to maintain stable populations on suboptimal habitats. We show how the Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia), a critically endangered endemic reptile from Tenerife Island (Canary Islands), is able to maintain stable populations in relic habitats thanks to its interactions with the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) colony. The stable isotope analysis revealed that G. intermedia rely direct or indirectly on marine subsidies for its diet and that the foraging area of this reptile is likely to be restricted to the area occupied by a breeding colony of L. michahellis. Furthermore, an antipredator behaviour analysis showed that L. michahellis displayed a strong anti-predator or mobbing respond against cats (Felis catus), one of the main threats for G. intermedia, thus potentially providing some protection against predators for the reptiles inhabiting the seabird colony. Our results show how unusual and poorly studied biotic interactions can provide a valuable resources and conditions for the conservation of a critically endangered species inhabiting a suboptimal or relict habitat.\nAirborne eDNA captures three decades of ecosystem biodiversity\nAuthors: Sullivan, A. R.; Karlsson, E.; Svensson, D.; Brindefalk, B.; Antonio Villegas, J.; Mikko, A.; Bellieny, D.; Siddique, A. B.; Johansson, A.-M.; Grahn, H.; Sundell, D.; Norman, A.; Esseen, P.-A.; Sjodin, A.; Singh, N. J.; Brodin, T.; Forsman, M.; Stenberg, P.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.569882\nConserving biodiversity is a global imperative, yet our capacity to quantify and understand species occurrences has been limited. To help address this challenge, we develop a novel monitoring approach based on deep sequencing of airborne eDNA. When applied to a 34-year archive of weekly filters from an aerosol sampling station in northern Sweden, our methods enabled robust detection of over 2,700 genera across all domains of life and estimates of eDNA catchment areas. Reconstructed time series revealed regional biodiversity declines consistent with contemporary, large-scale transformations of forest composition and structure. Our results show airborne eDNA can reliably monitor biodiversity and underscore the immense latent potential in the thousands of aerosol monitoring stations deployed worldwide.\nPlanting diversity begets multifaceted tree diversity in oil palm landscapes\nAuthors: Paterno, G.

Here, we experimentally tested the performance of passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity by establishing 52 tree islands in an oil palm landscape. Tree diversity via natural regeneration was shaped by local rather than landscape properties, with the diversity of planted tree species and tree island size driving higher multifaceted diversity. We show that large tree islands with higher initial planted diversity catalyze the recovery of multifaceted diversity at both the local and landscape level, including forest-associated species. Our results demonstrate that planted diversity begets regenerating diversity, overcoming major limitations of natural regeneration in highly modified landscapes. By elucidating the contribution of experimental, local, and landscape drivers to natural regeneration, these findings provide practical insights to make oil palm landscapes more biodiversity-friendly by enhancing functional and phylogenetic diversity within plantations.\nDo you have enough space? Habitat selection of insectivorous cave-dwelling bats in fragmented landscapes of Eastern Amazon\nAuthors: Tavares, V. d. C.; Ribeiro, M. S.; Prous, X.; Notini, A. A.; Kaku-Oliveira, N. Y.; Maciel, L. M. D.; Sales, S.; Longo, J. M.; Evangelista, F. M.; Rabelo, L.; Brandi, I.; Vasconcelos, S. S.; Talamoni, S. S.; Oliveira, G.; Trevelin, L. C.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570662\nIndividual movements of bats result from a compromise between their recognition of the environment and their potential to fulfill bats life requirements, and to the potential threats associated with moving, all of this is mediated by habitat selection. Mining activities produce modifications to the environments that add heterogeneity and fragmentation to the landscapes used by bats, with overall poorly understood consequences to their movements and to the underground-related biodiversity. Cave dwelling bats spend a large part of their life cycle within their roosts, and they are of paramount importance to the subterranean biodiversity because of their constant movements between the external landscapes, which they selectively use, and the underground ecosystems, where they usually apport energy in form of organic matter. We investigated the variation of patterns of habitat use and selection by cave-dwelling bats in a mosaic of disturbed and conserved Eastern Amazonian forests and rupestrian iron-rich savannas (cangas) interspersed in an extensive iron-caves system. We studied the movements of two phylogenetically distant related insectivores, the aerial insect-catcher Furipterus horrens (Furipteridae) and the foliage gleaning bat Lonchorhina aurita (Phyllostomidae), both cave-dependent in the study area, one of them categorized as threatened to extinction in Brazil, and virtually unknown in terms of their movement behavior, and habitat use. We used radio telemetry to assess habitat use, under the prediction that these species prefer natural and conserved habitats for their foraging bouts, avoiding human-modified habitats. We also anticipated larger range-areas and commuting distances for both species when foraging in disturbed landscapes. Thirty-one bats were monitored in different landscapes (conserved Amazonian ombrophilous forests and cangas, mining sites and pasture) resulting in an average range of 346.9 {+/-} 762.5 ha and an average commuting distance of 1921.5 {+/-} 2269.7 m for F. horrens and of 716.8 {+/-} 1000.6 ha and 2582.2 {+/-} 1966.0 m for L. aurita. Our habitat selection analyses suggest that Furipterus horrens is an open space forager, with individuals frequently recorded foraging in cangas, and L. aurita is a forest forager, although using all habitats proportionally to their availability in the landscape. We did not detect landscape-related effects to the use of space by both species, whereas seasonal variation emerged as a relevant effect. This is the first time that movement data for F. horrens and L. aurita is presented. Our study delivers original baseline data on movement behavior and conservation of these threatened cave-dwelling bat species with virtually unknown biology and shed light into constraints related to the optimal and adjusted biological cycles of the bats and their range areas under scenarios of disturbance.\nSeedling microbiota engineering using bacterial synthetic community inoculation on seeds\nAuthors: Arnault, G.; Marais, C.; Preveaux, A.; Briand, M.; Poisson, A.-S.; Sarniguet, A.; Barret, M.; Simonin, M.\nScore: 17.1, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568582\nSynthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.\nEffects of urbanisation, habitat characteristics, and management on garden pond biodiversity: a citizen science approach\nAuthors: Marton, Z.; Barta, B.; Vad, C. F.; Szabo, B.; Hamer, A. J.; Kardos, V.; Laskai, C.; Fierpasz, A.; Horvath, Z.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570789\nThe rapid expansion of urban areas leads to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of natural habitats, posing a serious threat to biodiversity. While urban ponds might contribute substantially to the biodiversity of urban blue-green infrastructure, the role of garden ponds, one of their most numerous representatives, is still little known. We lack a comprehensive understanding of how local habitat features, different forms of management, and urbanisation might impact the biodiversity of these habitats. This study aimed to reveal the importance of garden ponds via a country-wide online citizen science survey in Hungary, Central Europe. Based on data from over 800 pond owners, we gained knowledge about the prevalence and local frequency of various native animal groups, including amphibians, odonates, and birds, as well as information regarding introduced animals, such as fish. Additionally, we collected data about pond features and management practices. We tested the effect of pond features, pond management, and landscape-level drivers (urbanisation, surrounding wetland coverage) on the presence of conspicuous animal groups (adult amphibians, birds, odonates, and tadpoles) along with species of adult amphibians to identify the potential drivers of the biodiversity of garden ponds. Key pond features like pond age, area, aquatic and shoreline vegetation were the most important factors, while algaecide addition was the most influential management practice negatively affecting the presence of amphibians. Urbanisation had a negative effect on the presence of adult amphibians and their tadpoles, but surprisingly, it was not negatively associated with the presence of odonates and birds. Our results demonstrate the vital role of garden ponds in urban biodiversity conservation, most notably by providing secondary habitats and contributing to amphibian conservation, as evidenced by the occurrence of 13 species. Emphasizing public involvement is key in developing effective urban biodiversity conservation strategies and recognizing citizens' potential contributions to a better functioning blue-green infrastructure.\nTrade-off between light deprivation and desiccation in intertidal seagrasses due to periodic tidal inundation and exposure: insights from a data-calibrated model\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Adams, M. P.; Shao, D.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570383\nMany seagrass species thrive in shallow intertidal zones globally, adapting to periodic tidal inundation and exposure with distinctive physiological traits and offering crucial ecosystem services. However, predicting the responses of intertidal seagrasses to external stressors is hampered by the complexity of the dynamic and harsh environments they occupy. Consequently, intertidal seagrass growth models, especially those incorporating dynamic physiological responses, are scarce in the literature. Our study comprehensively collated relevant data from the literature to parameterize the relationship between air exposure, seagrass leaf water content and photosynthetic efficiency to inform new growth rate functions for generalisable intertidal seagrass growth models. We tested the applicability of these model formulations for scenarios with varying physiological process assumptions, seagrass species, tidal conditions, meadow elevations and water turbidity. We found that neglecting air-exposed physiological responses (i.e., leaf water content loss and reduced photosynthetic efficiency) can substantially overestimate seagrass growth rates. We also observed a trade-off between light deprivation and desiccation on intertidal seagrass growth under specific tidal ranges and turbidity conditions. This can yield an \"optimal\" elevation where combined stressors of desiccation (increasing with meadow elevation) and light deprivation (decreasing with meadow elevation) are minimized. The predicted optimal elevation, i.e., the most suitable habitat for intertidal seagrass, moves upward as water turbidity increases. Our study provides both conceptual and quantitative guidance for ecological modellers to include air exposure responses of intertidal seagrasses in coastal ecosystem models. The model also helps to evaluate the viability of intertidal seagrass habitats and inform site selection for seagrass restoration.\nA regional One Health approach to the risk of invasion by Anopheles stephensi in Mauritius\nAuthors: Iyaloo, D. P.; Zohdy, S.; Carney, R.; Mosawa, V. R.; Elahee, K. B.; Carter, T.; Bhoobun, H.; Spear, J.; Munglee, N.; Latchooman, N.; Puryag, S.; Bheecarry, A.; Bedja, S. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570234\nBackgroundAnopheles stephensi is an invasive malaria vector in Africa that threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa and is at risk of introduction due to this connectivity. For early detection of An. stephensi, the Vector Biology and Control Division under the Ministry of Health in Mauritius, leveraged a well-established Aedes program, as An. stephensi is known to share Aedes habitats. These efforts triggered multisectoral coordination and cascading benefits of integrated vector and One Health approaches. MethodsBeginning June 2021, entomological surveys were conducted at points of entry (seaport, airport) and on ships transporting livestock in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Department, the Mauritian Port Authority and National Veterinary Services. A total of 39, 18, 723 mosquito larval surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and other localities in Mauritius while 20, two and 26 adult mosquito surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and twenty-six animal points. Alongside adult mosquito surveys, surveillance of vectors of veterinary importance (e.g.- licoides spp.) was also carried out in collaboration with National Parks and Conservation Service and land owners. ResultsA total of 8,428 adult mosquitoes were collected and 1,844 larval habitats were positive for mosquitoes. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified and 151 Anopheles and 339 Aedes mosquitoes were also molecularly characterized. Mosquito species detected were Aedes albopictus, Anopheles arabiensis, An. coustani, An. merus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. thalassius and Lutzia tigripes. Anopheles stephensi was not detected. The One Health approach was shared with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), strengthening collaboration between Mauritius and Reunion Island on vector surveillance at entry points and insecticide resistance monitoring. The Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) was also alerted to the risk of An. stephensi, leading to regional efforts supporting trainings and development of a response strategy to An. stephensi bringing together stakeholders from Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles. ConclusionsMauritius is a model system showing how existing public health entomology capabilities can be used to enhance vector surveillance and control and create multisectoral networks to respond to any emerging public and veterinary health vector-borne disease threat. Author summaryThe malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is invasive in Africa where it threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread throughout the continent. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa through maritime trade and therefore may be at risk of An. stephensi introduction and establishment. Mauritius implemented a One Health approach, enhancing entomological surveillance at entry points and collaborating across sectors (e.g. veterinary services, sea and air port authorities, national parks and conservation, communities, etc.) conducted extensive integrated vector surveillance, inspecting 85,071 larval habitats, and analyzing 8,428 adult mosquitoes morphologically and molecularly. Although An. stephensi was not detected, the initiative catalyzed and strengthened multisectoral partnerships nationally and across the Indian Ocean region member states (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles). Leveraging the threat of An. stephensi, Mauritius exemplifies utilizing existing capabilities to create multisectoral networks for effective vector surveillance and response.\nEnvironmental DNA captures the internal structure of a pond metacommunity\nAuthors: Cai, W.; Pichler, M.; Biggs, J.; Nicolet, P.; Ewald, N.; Griffiths, R. A.; Bush, A.; Leibold, M. A.; Hartig, F.; Yu, D. W.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571176\nMetacommunity theory unites community and spatial ecology. Recent innovations in sequencing technology may now allow us, for the first time, to confront this theory with entire trophic community data at large scales. We metabarcoded vertebrate eDNA from 320 ponds in England. Using this \"novel community data\", we calculated the \"internal structure\" of this metacommunity, which is the contributions of environmental, biotic, and spatial processes, as well as stochasticity, to the distribution of each species and the composition of each site. Our results suggest that community assembly processes in this pondscape do not conform to a single metacommunity paradigm, but rather vary among species and over space. Combining this variation with external knowledge of species biologies allows us to better understand the differential influences of environmental filtering, species interactions, and dispersal limitation on several of the vertebrate species, paving the way for the routine empirical study of metacommunities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Climate change is drastically affecting the phenologies of species worldwide, including shifts in development. The potential impact of climate change on the synchronicity of plant-insect phenology is particularly concerning since the stability of pollination networks and food chains depends on their tight temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the recently reported insect armageddon makes it urgent to establish trends and identify primary drivers of plant-insect phenological synchrony. Here, coupling high-resolution remote sensing and citizen science data across Europe over 34 years, we examine the differences in occurrence dates of 1,584 herbivorous insects across four orders and the corresponding dates of leaf unfolding. We find that 61.2% of the vegetation and insect phenologies have become highly asynchronous, with vegetation phenology advancing four-fold faster than insect phenology. These trends were modulated by insect life-cycles and taxonomic order. A primary driver of this phenological mismatch is the higher sensitivity of vegetation phenology than insect phenology to climate, which has prevented insects from matching the pace of plant phenological advance in the growing season. Our analyses provide a unique continental overview and underlying mechanisms of the asynchronicity between vegetation and insect phenologies, thus enhancing our ability to predict and manage its potential cascading ecological effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anthropogenic driven environmental changes are pushing species to the limits of their habitats. More often species are restricted to relic or suboptimal habitats that present the minimum requirements to sustain species populations. In this scenario of acerated environmental change and biodiversity loss, is fundamental to understand why species are able to survive in such suboptimal conditions. In this study, we conduct an isotopic trophic analysis along with a behavioural experiment to show how novel ecological interactions allow an endangered species to maintain stable populations on suboptimal habitats. We show how the Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia), a critically endangered endemic reptile from Tenerife Island (Canary Islands), is able to maintain stable populations in relic habitats thanks to its interactions with the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) colony. The stable isotope analysis revealed that G. intermedia rely direct or indirectly on marine subsidies for its diet and that the foraging area of this reptile is likely to be restricted to the area occupied by a breeding colony of L. michahellis. Furthermore, an antipredator behaviour analysis showed that L. michahellis displayed a strong anti-predator or mobbing respond against cats (Felis catus), one of the main threats for G. intermedia, thus potentially providing some protection against predators for the reptiles inhabiting the seabird colony. Our results show how unusual and poorly studied biotic interactions can provide a valuable resources and conditions for the conservation of a critically endangered species inhabiting a suboptimal or relict habitat.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Conserving biodiversity is a global imperative, yet our capacity to quantify and understand species occurrences has been limited. To help address this challenge, we develop a novel monitoring approach based on deep sequencing of airborne eDNA. When applied to a 34-year archive of weekly filters from an aerosol sampling station in northern Sweden, our methods enabled robust detection of over 2,700 genera across all domains of life and estimates of eDNA catchment areas. Reconstructed time series revealed regional biodiversity declines consistent with contemporary, large-scale transformations of forest composition and structure. Our results show airborne eDNA can reliably monitor biodiversity and underscore the immense latent potential in the thousands of aerosol monitoring stations deployed worldwide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Optimizing restoration outcomes is crucial for enhancing multifaceted diversity, resilience, and ecosystem functioning in monoculture-dominated landscapes globally. Here, we experimentally tested the performance of passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity by establishing 52 tree islands in an oil palm landscape. Tree diversity via natural regeneration was shaped by local rather than landscape properties, with the diversity of planted tree species and tree island size driving higher multifaceted diversity. We show that large tree islands with higher initial planted diversity catalyze the recovery of multifaceted diversity at both the local and landscape level, including forest-associated species. Our results demonstrate that planted diversity begets regenerating diversity, overcoming major limitations of natural regeneration in highly modified landscapes. By elucidating the contribution of experimental, local, and landscape drivers to natural regeneration, these findings provide practical insights to make oil palm landscapes more biodiversity-friendly by enhancing functional and phylogenetic diversity within plantations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual movements of bats result from a compromise between their recognition of the environment and their potential to fulfill bats life requirements, and to the potential threats associated with moving, all of this is mediated by habitat selection. Mining activities produce modifications to the environments that add heterogeneity and fragmentation to the landscapes used by bats, with overall poorly understood consequences to their movements and to the underground-related biodiversity. Cave dwelling bats spend a large part of their life cycle within their roosts, and they are of paramount importance to the subterranean biodiversity because of their constant movements between the external landscapes, which they selectively use, and the underground ecosystems, where they usually apport energy in form of organic matter. We investigated the variation of patterns of habitat use and selection by cave-dwelling bats in a mosaic of disturbed and conserved Eastern Amazonian forests and rupestrian iron-rich savannas (cangas) interspersed in an extensive iron-caves system. We studied the movements of two phylogenetically distant related insectivores, the aerial insect-catcher Furipterus horrens (Furipteridae) and the foliage gleaning bat Lonchorhina aurita (Phyllostomidae), both cave-dependent in the study area, one of them categorized as threatened to extinction in Brazil, and virtually unknown in terms of their movement behavior, and habitat use. We used radio telemetry to assess habitat use, under the prediction that these species prefer natural and conserved habitats for their foraging bouts, avoiding human-modified habitats. We also anticipated larger range-areas and commuting distances for both species when foraging in disturbed landscapes. Thirty-one bats were monitored in different landscapes (conserved Amazonian ombrophilous forests and cangas, mining sites and pasture) resulting in an average range of 346.9 {&#43;/-} 762.5 ha and an average commuting distance of 1921.5 {&#43;/-} 2269.7 m for F. horrens and of 716.8 {&#43;/-} 1000.6 ha and 2582.2 {&#43;/-} 1966.0 m for L. aurita. Our habitat selection analyses suggest that Furipterus horrens is an open space forager, with individuals frequently recorded foraging in cangas, and L. aurita is a forest forager, although using all habitats proportionally to their availability in the landscape. We did not detect landscape-related effects to the use of space by both species, whereas seasonal variation emerged as a relevant effect. This is the first time that movement data for F. horrens and L. aurita is presented. Our study delivers original baseline data on movement behavior and conservation of these threatened cave-dwelling bat species with virtually unknown biology and shed light into constraints related to the optimal and adjusted biological cycles of the bats and their range areas under scenarios of disturbance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid expansion of urban areas leads to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of natural habitats, posing a serious threat to biodiversity. While urban ponds might contribute substantially to the biodiversity of urban blue-green infrastructure, the role of garden ponds, one of their most numerous representatives, is still little known. We lack a comprehensive understanding of how local habitat features, different forms of management, and urbanisation might impact the biodiversity of these habitats. This study aimed to reveal the importance of garden ponds via a country-wide online citizen science survey in Hungary, Central Europe. Based on data from over 800 pond owners, we gained knowledge about the prevalence and local frequency of various native animal groups, including amphibians, odonates, and birds, as well as information regarding introduced animals, such as fish. Additionally, we collected data about pond features and management practices. We tested the effect of pond features, pond management, and landscape-level drivers (urbanisation, surrounding wetland coverage) on the presence of conspicuous animal groups (adult amphibians, birds, odonates, and tadpoles) along with species of adult amphibians to identify the potential drivers of the biodiversity of garden ponds. Key pond features like pond age, area, aquatic and shoreline vegetation were the most important factors, while algaecide addition was the most influential management practice negatively affecting the presence of amphibians. Urbanisation had a negative effect on the presence of adult amphibians and their tadpoles, but surprisingly, it was not negatively associated with the presence of odonates and birds. Our results demonstrate the vital role of garden ponds in urban biodiversity conservation, most notably by providing secondary habitats and contributing to amphibian conservation, as evidenced by the occurrence of 13 species. Emphasizing public involvement is key in developing effective urban biodiversity conservation strategies and recognizing citizens&#39; potential contributions to a better functioning blue-green infrastructure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many seagrass species thrive in shallow intertidal zones globally, adapting to periodic tidal inundation and exposure with distinctive physiological traits and offering crucial ecosystem services. However, predicting the responses of intertidal seagrasses to external stressors is hampered by the complexity of the dynamic and harsh environments they occupy. Consequently, intertidal seagrass growth models, especially those incorporating dynamic physiological responses, are scarce in the literature. Our study comprehensively collated relevant data from the literature to parameterize the relationship between air exposure, seagrass leaf water content and photosynthetic efficiency to inform new growth rate functions for generalisable intertidal seagrass growth models. We tested the applicability of these model formulations for scenarios with varying physiological process assumptions, seagrass species, tidal conditions, meadow elevations and water turbidity. We found that neglecting air-exposed physiological responses (i.e., leaf water content loss and reduced photosynthetic efficiency) can substantially overestimate seagrass growth rates. We also observed a trade-off between light deprivation and desiccation on intertidal seagrass growth under specific tidal ranges and turbidity conditions. This can yield an &#34;optimal&#34; elevation where combined stressors of desiccation (increasing with meadow elevation) and light deprivation (decreasing with meadow elevation) are minimized. The predicted optimal elevation, i.e., the most suitable habitat for intertidal seagrass, moves upward as water turbidity increases. Our study provides both conceptual and quantitative guidance for ecological modellers to include air exposure responses of intertidal seagrasses in coastal ecosystem models. The model also helps to evaluate the viability of intertidal seagrass habitats and inform site selection for seagrass restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnopheles stephensi is an invasive malaria vector in Africa that threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa and is at risk of introduction due to this connectivity. For early detection of An. stephensi, the Vector Biology and Control Division under the Ministry of Health in Mauritius, leveraged a well-established Aedes program, as An. stephensi is known to share Aedes habitats. These efforts triggered multisectoral coordination and cascading benefits of integrated vector and One Health approaches.

MethodsBeginning June 2021, entomological surveys were conducted at points of entry (seaport, airport) and on ships transporting livestock in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Department, the Mauritian Port Authority and National Veterinary Services.

A total of 39, 18, 723 mosquito larval surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and other localities in Mauritius while 20, two and 26 adult mosquito surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and twenty-six animal points. Alongside adult mosquito surveys, surveillance of vectors of veterinary importance (e.g.- licoides spp.) was also carried out in collaboration with National Parks and Conservation Service and land owners.

ResultsA total of 8,428 adult mosquitoes were collected and 1,844 larval habitats were positive for mosquitoes. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified and 151 Anopheles and 339 Aedes mosquitoes were also molecularly characterized. Mosquito species detected were Aedes albopictus, Anopheles arabiensis, An. coustani, An. merus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. thalassius and Lutzia tigripes. Anopheles stephensi was not detected. The One Health approach was shared with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), strengthening collaboration between Mauritius and Reunion Island on vector surveillance at entry points and insecticide resistance monitoring. The Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) was also alerted to the risk of An. stephensi, leading to regional efforts supporting trainings and development of a response strategy to An. stephensi bringing together stakeholders from Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles.

ConclusionsMauritius is a model system showing how existing public health entomology capabilities can be used to enhance vector surveillance and control and create multisectoral networks to respond to any emerging public and veterinary health vector-borne disease threat.

Author summaryThe malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is invasive in Africa where it threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread throughout the continent. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa through maritime trade and therefore may be at risk of An. stephensi introduction and establishment. Mauritius implemented a One Health approach, enhancing entomological surveillance at entry points and collaborating across sectors (e.g. veterinary services, sea and air port authorities, national parks and conservation, communities, etc.) conducted extensive integrated vector surveillance, inspecting 85,071 larval habitats, and analyzing 8,428 adult mosquitoes morphologically and molecularly. Although An. stephensi was not detected, the initiative catalyzed and strengthened multisectoral partnerships nationally and across the Indian Ocean region member states (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles). Leveraging the threat of An. stephensi, Mauritius exemplifies utilizing existing capabilities to create multisectoral networks for effective vector surveillance and response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metacommunity theory unites community and spatial ecology. Recent innovations in sequencing technology may now allow us, for the first time, to confront this theory with entire trophic community data at large scales. We metabarcoded vertebrate eDNA from 320 ponds in England. Using this &#34;novel community data&#34;, we calculated the &#34;internal structure&#34; of this metacommunity, which is the contributions of environmental, biotic, and spatial processes, as well as stochasticity, to the distribution of each species and the composition of each site. Our results suggest that community assembly processes in this pondscape do not conform to a single metacommunity paradigm, but rather vary among species and over space. Combining this variation with external knowledge of species biologies allows us to better understand the differential influences of environmental filtering, species interactions, and dispersal limitation on several of the vertebrate species, paving the way for the routine empirical study of metacommunities.</p>
