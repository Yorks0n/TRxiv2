While the stress-gradient hypothesis predicts the strength of competition to decrease with increasing stress, our understanding of how competition varies with stress is limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding of how resource-use traits underlying competitive dynamics respond to stress. C_LIO_LIHere, we use duckweeds in the Lemna species complex to measure how phenotypic and genetic variation in R* (a resource acquisition trait representing the minimum resource requirement for positive population growth) varies with high-temperature stress to better understand how stress alters competitive ability for essential resources. C_LIO_LIWe found that heat stress increased the R* of Lemna plants for nitrogen acquisition. Because lower R* values predict dominance in competitive dynamics where resources are limiting, this indicates that under stressful, high temperatures, plants could experience increased sensitivity to competition due to the higher resources required to sustain positive population growth rates. C_LIO_LIWe found minimal genetic variation in R* across 11 local genotypes within the Lemna species complex, indicating that selection on resource acquisition strategies for essential resources such as nitrogen may be constrained in nature. The expression of genetic variation in R* for nitrogen was further reduced under heat stress, suggesting that the response to selection for R* could be particularly constrained under high-temperature stress. C_LIO_LIContrary to predictions drawn from the gleaner-opportunist trade-off, we did not find evidence for a trade-off in resource acquisition strategies under benign conditions or high-temperature stress. Plants with lower R* (i.e., higher growth rates under lower nitrogen levels) were not constrained to have lower growth rates under higher nitrogen levels, possibly because the chosen genotypes have not diverged across resource acquisition strategies or because Lemna spp. has escaped this constraint. C_LIO_LIImportantly, our work outlines that high-temperature stress could increase sensitivity to competition through increased requirement for resources while reducing the evolutionary potential for Lemna species to respond to selection for resource traits. This study acts as a key step to understanding the mechanistic traits behind competitive dynamics in resource-limited and stressful environments. C_LI\nThermal biology of bee pollinators: diversity and community-level correlates\nAuthors: Herrera, C. M.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568883\nCommunity-wide assembly of plant-pollinator systems depends on an intricate combination of biotic and abiotic factors, including heterogeneity among pollinators in thermal biology and responses to abiotic environmental gradients. Studies on the thermal biology of pollinators, however, have mostly considered only one or a few species of plants or pollinators at a time, and the possible driving role of the diversity in thermal biology of pollinator asemblages at the plant community level thus remains largely unexplored. More specifically, it is unknown whether expected diversity in the thermal biology of bees, a major, species-rich pollinator group worldwide, contributes to the assembly and maintenance of diverse bee communities, broadens the spectrum of possibilities available to bee-pollinated plants, facilitate interspecific partitioning of ecological gradients across habitats, seasons and time of day, and/or enhance plant pollination success through complementarity effects. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity in thermal biology of the bee assemblage pollinating the community of entomophilous plants from a Mediterranean montane area, and to elucidate whether there existed seasonal, daily, between-habitat or floral visitation correlates of bee thermal biology which could contribute to partition ecological gradients among plant and bee species. Thermal biology parameters were obtained in the laboratory (K, intrinsic warming constant) and the field (thoracic and ambient temperature at foraging site, Tth and Tair) on individual bees of a diverse sample (N = 204 bee species) comprising most bee pollinators of the regional plant community. Species-specific thermal biology parameters were combined with quantitative field data on bee pollinators and flower visitation for the regional community of entomophilous plants (N = 292 plant species). Results revealed that the regional bee assemblage harbored considerable diversity in thermal biology features, that such diversity was mostly taxonomically and body-size structured, and that the broad interspecific heterogeneity in thermal biology represented in the bee community as a whole eventually translated into daily, seasonal, among-habitat and flower visitation patterns at the plant community level. This lends support to the hypothesis that broad diversity in thermal biology of bees can act enhancing opportunities for bee coexistence, spatio-temporal partitioning of floral resources, and plant pollination success.

K.; Chakraverti-Wuerthwein, M.; Li, Z.; Tikhonov, M.; Mani, M.; Gowda, K.; Kuehn, S.\nScore: 22.0, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.542950\nMicrobial metabolism sustains life on Earth. Sequencing surveys of communities in hosts, oceans, and soils have revealed ubiquitous patterns linking the microbes present, the genes they possess, and local environmental conditions. One prominent explanation for these patterns is environmental filtering: local conditions select strains with particular traits. However, filtering assumes ecological interactions do not influence patterns, despite the fact that interactions can and do play an important role in structuring communities. Here, we demonstrate the insufficiency of the environmental filtering hypothesis for explaining global patterns in topsoil microbiomes. Using denitrification as a model system, we find that the abundances of two characteristic genotypes trade-off with pH; nar gene abundances increase while nap abundances decrease with declining pH. Contradicting the filtering hypothesis, we show that strains possessing the Nar genotype are enriched in low pH conditions but fail to grow alone. Instead, the dominance of Nar genotypes at low pH arises from an ecological interaction with Nap genotypes that alleviates nitrite toxicity. Our study provides a roadmap for dissecting how global associations between environmental variables and gene abundances arise from environmentally modulated community interactions.\nConsistent individual positions within roosts in Spix's disc-winged bats\nAuthors: Giacomini, G.; Chaves-Ramirez, S.; Hernandez-Pinson, A.; Barrantes, J. P.; Chaverri, G.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.04.515223\nIndividuals within both moving and stationary groups arrange themselves in a predictable manner; for example, some individuals are consistently found at the front of the group or in the periphery and others in the center. Each position may be associated with various costs, such as greater exposure to predators, and benefits, such as preferential access to food. In social bats, we would expect a similar consistent arrangement for groups at roost-sites, which is where these mammals spend the largest portion of their lives. Here we study the relative position of individuals within a roost-site and establish if sex, age, and vocal behavior are associated with a given position. We focus on the highly cohesive and mobile social groups found in Spixs disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) given this species use of a tubular roosting structure that forces individuals to be arranged linearly within its internal space. We obtained high scores for linearity measures, particularly for the top and bottom positions, indicating that bats position themselves in a predictable way despite constant roost-switching. We also found that sex and age were associated with the use of certain positions within the roost; for example, males and subadults tend to occupy the top part (near the roosts entrance) more often than expected by chance. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that bats are capable of maintaining a consistent and predictable position within their roosts despite having to relocate daily, and that there is a link between individual traits and position preferences.\nSeedling microbiota engineering using bacterial synthetic community inoculation on seeds\nAuthors: Arnault, G.; Marais, C.; Preveaux, A.; Briand, M.; Poisson, A.-S.; Sarniguet, A.; Barret, M.; Simonin, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568582\nSynthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.\nEvidence that recent climatic changes have expanded the potential geographic range of the Mediterranean fruit fly\nAuthors: Szyniszewska, A. M.; Bieszczak, H.; Kozyra, K.; Papadopoulos, N. T.; De Meyer, M.; Nowosad, J.; Ota, N.; Kriticos, D. J.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.566983\nThe species distributions migration poleward and into higher altitudes in a warming climate is especially concerning for economically important insect pest species, as their introduction can potentially occur in places previously considered unsuitable for year-round survival. We explore the expansion of the climatically suitable areas for a horticultural pest, the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Diptera, Tephritidae), with an emphasis on Europe and California. We reviewed and refined a published CLIMEX model for C. capitata, taking into consideration new records in marginal locations, with a particular focus on Europe. To assess the model fit and to aid in interpreting the meaning of the new European distribution records, we used a time series climate dataset to explore the temporal patterns of climate suitability for C. capitata from the 1970 to 2019. At selected bellwether sites in Europe, we found statistically significant trends in increasing climate suitability, as well as a substantial northward expansion in the modelled potential range. In California, we also found a significant trend of northward and altitudinal expansion of areas suitable for C. capitata establishment. These results provide further evidence of climate changes impact on species distributions and the need for innovative responses to increased invasion threats.\nBeyond accuracy : score calibration in deep learning models for camera trap image sequences\nAuthors: Dussert, G.; Chamaille-Jammes, S.; Dray, S.; Miele, V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566512\nO_LIIn this paper, we investigate whether deep learning models for species classification in camera trap images are well calibrated, i.e. whether predicted confidence scores can be reliably interpreted as probabilities that the predictions are true. Additionally, as camera traps are often configured to take multiple photos of the same event, we also explore the calibration of predictions at the sequence level. C_LIO_LIHere, we (i) train deep learning models on a large and diverse European camera trap dataset, using five established architectures; (ii) compare their calibration and classification performances on three independent test sets; (iii) measure the performances at sequence level using four approaches to aggregate individuals predictions; (iv) study the effect and the practicality of a post-hoc calibration method, for both image and sequence levels. C_LIO_LIOur results first suggest that calibration and accuracy are closely intertwined and vary greatly across model architectures. Secondly, we observe that averaging the logits over the sequence before applying softmax normalization emerges as the most effective method for achieving both good calibration and accuracy at the sequence level. Finally, temperature scaling can be a practical solution to further improve calibration, given the generalizability of the optimum temperature across datasets. C_LIO_LIWe conclude that, with adequate methodology, deep learning models for species classification can be very well calibrated. This considerably improves the interpretability of the confidence scores and their usability in ecological downstream tasks. C_LI\nModeling Tick Populations: An Ecological Test Case forGradient Boosted Trees\nAuthors: Manley, W.; Tran, T.; Prusinski, M.; Brisson, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.532443\nGeneral linear models have been the foundational statistical framework used to discover the ecological processes that explain the distribution and abundance of natural populations. Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to result in accurate predictions of the distribution and abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous assessments of the theoretical advantages of these methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to identify environmental features that explain observed variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient boosted and linear models use similar environmental features to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted models found non-linear relationships and interactions that are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional model types that provide practical advantages for tick surveillance and public health. The results highlight the potential of gradient boosted models to discover novel ecological phenomena affecting pathogen demography and as a powerful public health tool to mitigate disease risks.\nCompetition for shared resources increases the impact of propagule size during coalescence of gut microbial communities\nAuthors: Goldman, D. A.; Xue, K. S.; Parrott, A. B.; Lopez, J. G.; Vila, J. C.; Petrov, D. A.; Good, B. H.; Relman, D. A.; Huang, K. C.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569120\nThe outcomes of species introductions depend on both propagule size and resource competition, but the effects of these factors are inconsistent across community contexts. Here, we investigate how propagule size and resource competition interact to shape colonization during community coalescence by mixing pairs of in vitro gut microbial communities at ratios that vary over seven orders of magnitude. Each resulting co-culture contained species whose relative abundance depended on inoculation dose, causing the composition of some co-cultures to vary substantially across mixture ratios, even after \u003e30 generations of growth. Using a consumer-resource model, we show that dose-dependent colonization can arise when niche overlap is high and species compete near-neutrally for shared resources. This model successfully predicts the outcomes of mixtures of strain isolates, in which propagule size has larger, longer-lasting effects in more diverse communities. Our study establishes a framework for predicting the context-dependent impacts of propagule size, providing principles for the design of microbiome therapeutics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">O_LIUnderstanding how competition varies with environmental stress is critical to anticipating species and community responses to rapid environmental change. While the stress-gradient hypothesis predicts the strength of competition to decrease with increasing stress, our understanding of how competition varies with stress is limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding of how resource-use traits underlying competitive dynamics respond to stress.
C_LIO_LIHere, we use duckweeds in the Lemna species complex to measure how phenotypic and genetic variation in R* (a resource acquisition trait representing the minimum resource requirement for positive population growth) varies with high-temperature stress to better understand how stress alters competitive ability for essential resources.
C_LIO_LIWe found that heat stress increased the R* of Lemna plants for nitrogen acquisition. Because lower R* values predict dominance in competitive dynamics where resources are limiting, this indicates that under stressful, high temperatures, plants could experience increased sensitivity to competition due to the higher resources required to sustain positive population growth rates.
C_LIO_LIWe found minimal genetic variation in R* across 11 local genotypes within the Lemna species complex, indicating that selection on resource acquisition strategies for essential resources such as nitrogen may be constrained in nature. The expression of genetic variation in R* for nitrogen was further reduced under heat stress, suggesting that the response to selection for R* could be particularly constrained under high-temperature stress.
C_LIO_LIContrary to predictions drawn from the gleaner-opportunist trade-off, we did not find evidence for a trade-off in resource acquisition strategies under benign conditions or high-temperature stress. Plants with lower R* (i.e., higher growth rates under lower nitrogen levels) were not constrained to have lower growth rates under higher nitrogen levels, possibly because the chosen genotypes have not diverged across resource acquisition strategies or because Lemna spp. has escaped this constraint.
C_LIO_LIImportantly, our work outlines that high-temperature stress could increase sensitivity to competition through increased requirement for resources while reducing the evolutionary potential for Lemna species to respond to selection for resource traits. This study acts as a key step to understanding the mechanistic traits behind competitive dynamics in resource-limited and stressful environments.

        <p class="abstract">Community-wide assembly of plant-pollinator systems depends on an intricate combination of biotic and abiotic factors, including heterogeneity among pollinators in thermal biology and responses to abiotic environmental gradients. Studies on the thermal biology of pollinators, however, have mostly considered only one or a few species of plants or pollinators at a time, and the possible driving role of the diversity in thermal biology of pollinator asemblages at the plant community level thus remains largely unexplored. More specifically, it is unknown whether expected diversity in the thermal biology of bees, a major, species-rich pollinator group worldwide, contributes to the assembly and maintenance of diverse bee communities, broadens the spectrum of possibilities available to bee-pollinated plants, facilitate interspecific partitioning of ecological gradients across habitats, seasons and time of day, and/or enhance plant pollination success through complementarity effects. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity in thermal biology of the bee assemblage pollinating the community of entomophilous plants from a Mediterranean montane area, and to elucidate whether there existed seasonal, daily, between-habitat or floral visitation correlates of bee thermal biology which could contribute to partition ecological gradients among plant and bee species. Thermal biology parameters were obtained in the laboratory (K, intrinsic warming constant) and the field (thoracic and ambient temperature at foraging site, Tth and Tair) on individual bees of a diverse sample (N = 204 bee species) comprising most bee pollinators of the regional plant community. Species-specific thermal biology parameters were combined with quantitative field data on bee pollinators and flower visitation for the regional community of entomophilous plants (N = 292 plant species). Results revealed that the regional bee assemblage harbored considerable diversity in thermal biology features, that such diversity was mostly taxonomically and body-size structured, and that the broad interspecific heterogeneity in thermal biology represented in the bee community as a whole eventually translated into daily, seasonal, among-habitat and flower visitation patterns at the plant community level. This lends support to the hypothesis that broad diversity in thermal biology of bees can act enhancing opportunities for bee coexistence, spatio-temporal partitioning of floral resources, and plant pollination success.

        <p class="abstract">Microbial metabolism sustains life on Earth. Sequencing surveys of communities in hosts, oceans, and soils have revealed ubiquitous patterns linking the microbes present, the genes they possess, and local environmental conditions. One prominent explanation for these patterns is environmental filtering: local conditions select strains with particular traits. However, filtering assumes ecological interactions do not influence patterns, despite the fact that interactions can and do play an important role in structuring communities. Here, we demonstrate the insufficiency of the environmental filtering hypothesis for explaining global patterns in topsoil microbiomes. Using denitrification as a model system, we find that the abundances of two characteristic genotypes trade-off with pH; nar gene abundances increase while nap abundances decrease with declining pH. Contradicting the filtering hypothesis, we show that strains possessing the Nar genotype are enriched in low pH conditions but fail to grow alone. Instead, the dominance of Nar genotypes at low pH arises from an ecological interaction with Nap genotypes that alleviates nitrite toxicity. Our study provides a roadmap for dissecting how global associations between environmental variables and gene abundances arise from environmentally modulated community interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals within both moving and stationary groups arrange themselves in a predictable manner; for example, some individuals are consistently found at the front of the group or in the periphery and others in the center. Each position may be associated with various costs, such as greater exposure to predators, and benefits, such as preferential access to food. In social bats, we would expect a similar consistent arrangement for groups at roost-sites, which is where these mammals spend the largest portion of their lives. Here we study the relative position of individuals within a roost-site and establish if sex, age, and vocal behavior are associated with a given position. We focus on the highly cohesive and mobile social groups found in Spixs disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) given this species use of a tubular roosting structure that forces individuals to be arranged linearly within its internal space. We obtained high scores for linearity measures, particularly for the top and bottom positions, indicating that bats position themselves in a predictable way despite constant roost-switching. We also found that sex and age were associated with the use of certain positions within the roost; for example, males and subadults tend to occupy the top part (near the roosts entrance) more often than expected by chance. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that bats are capable of maintaining a consistent and predictable position within their roosts despite having to relocate daily, and that there is a link between individual traits and position preferences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The species distributions migration poleward and into higher altitudes in a warming climate is especially concerning for economically important insect pest species, as their introduction can potentially occur in places previously considered unsuitable for year-round survival. We explore the expansion of the climatically suitable areas for a horticultural pest, the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Diptera, Tephritidae), with an emphasis on Europe and California. We reviewed and refined a published CLIMEX model for C. capitata, taking into consideration new records in marginal locations, with a particular focus on Europe. To assess the model fit and to aid in interpreting the meaning of the new European distribution records, we used a time series climate dataset to explore the temporal patterns of climate suitability for C. capitata from the 1970 to 2019. At selected bellwether sites in Europe, we found statistically significant trends in increasing climate suitability, as well as a substantial northward expansion in the modelled potential range. In California, we also found a significant trend of northward and altitudinal expansion of areas suitable for C. capitata establishment. These results provide further evidence of climate changes impact on species distributions and the need for innovative responses to increased invasion threats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIn this paper, we investigate whether deep learning models for species classification in camera trap images are well calibrated, i.e. whether predicted confidence scores can be reliably interpreted as probabilities that the predictions are true. Additionally, as camera traps are often configured to take multiple photos of the same event, we also explore the calibration of predictions at the sequence level.
C_LIO_LIHere, we (i) train deep learning models on a large and diverse European camera trap dataset, using five established architectures; (ii) compare their calibration and classification performances on three independent test sets; (iii) measure the performances at sequence level using four approaches to aggregate individuals predictions; (iv) study the effect and the practicality of a post-hoc calibration method, for both image and sequence levels.
C_LIO_LIOur results first suggest that calibration and accuracy are closely intertwined and vary greatly across model architectures. Secondly, we observe that averaging the logits over the sequence before applying softmax normalization emerges as the most effective method for achieving both good calibration and accuracy at the sequence level. Finally, temperature scaling can be a practical solution to further improve calibration, given the generalizability of the optimum temperature across datasets.
C_LIO_LIWe conclude that, with adequate methodology, deep learning models for species classification can be very well calibrated. This considerably improves the interpretability of the confidence scores and their usability in ecological downstream tasks.

        <p class="abstract">General linear models have been the foundational statistical framework used to discover the ecological processes that explain the distribution and abundance of natural populations. Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to result in accurate predictions of the distribution and abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous assessments of the theoretical advantages of these methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to identify environmental features that explain observed variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient boosted and linear models use similar environmental features to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted models found non-linear relationships and interactions that are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional model types that provide practical advantages for tick surveillance and public health. The results highlight the potential of gradient boosted models to discover novel ecological phenomena affecting pathogen demography and as a powerful public health tool to mitigate disease risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The outcomes of species introductions depend on both propagule size and resource competition, but the effects of these factors are inconsistent across community contexts. Here, we investigate how propagule size and resource competition interact to shape colonization during community coalescence by mixing pairs of in vitro gut microbial communities at ratios that vary over seven orders of magnitude. Each resulting co-culture contained species whose relative abundance depended on inoculation dose, causing the composition of some co-cultures to vary substantially across mixture ratios, even after &gt;30 generations of growth. Using a consumer-resource model, we show that dose-dependent colonization can arise when niche overlap is high and species compete near-neutrally for shared resources. This model successfully predicts the outcomes of mixtures of strain isolates, in which propagule size has larger, longer-lasting effects in more diverse communities. Our study establishes a framework for predicting the context-dependent impacts of propagule size, providing principles for the design of microbiome therapeutics.</p>
