Identifying the mechanisms controlling their assembly and activities is a major challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we integrated Tara Oceans meta-omics data to predict genome-scale community interactions within prokaryotic assemblages in the euphotic ocean. A global genome-resolved co-activity network revealed a significant number of inter-lineage associations across large phylogenetic distances. Identified co-active communities included species displaying smaller genomes but encoding a higher potential for quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism. Community metabolic modelling revealed a higher potential for interaction within co-active communities and pointed towards conserved metabolic cross-feedings, in particular of specific amino acids and group B vitamins. Our integrated ecological and metabolic modelling approach indicates genome streamlining and metabolic auxotrophies as central joint mechanisms shaping bacterioplankton community assembly in the surface global ocean.\nCan higher-order interactions resolve the species coexistence paradox?\nAuthors: Gibbs, T. L.; Gellner, G.; Levin, S. A.; McCann, K. S.; Hastings, A.; Levine, J. M.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545649\nMost ecological models are based on the assumption that species interact in pairs. Emerging in diverse communities, however, are higher-order interactions, in which two or more species jointly impact the growth of a third species. A pitfall of the pairwise approach is that it misses the higher-order interactions potentially responsible for maintaining diversity in nature. Here, we explore how well higher-order interactions enable coexistence when pairwise interactions are insufficient to do so. Specifically, we explore the stability properties of systems where higher-order interactions guarantee that a specified set of abundances are a feasible equilibrium of the dynamics. Even these higher-order interactions do not necessarily produce robust coexistence. We find that facilitative higher-order interactions that counter pairwise competitive interactions are less likely to generate stable equilibria than competitive interactions countering pairwise facilitation. In both cases the system is more likely to be stable when the pairwise interactions are weak, and when the equilibrium abundances are near those produced by the pairwise interactions. Last, we show that correlations between the pairwise and higher-order interactions permit robust coexistence in diverse systems. Our work reveals the challenges in generating stable coexistence through higher-order interactions, but also uncovers higher-order interaction patterns that can enable diversity.\nTurning Ecology Against Pesticide Resistance: Exploiting Competition in Pest Populations Through Pesticide Use\nAuthors: Guariento, R. D.; Almeida-Gomes, M.; Oliveira-Santos, L. G. R.; Pires, A. P. F.; Roque, F. d. O.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545263\nModern agriculture is dependent on the efficacy of pesticides in controlling pests. However, such efficacy is threatened by the evolution of resistance. Although pesticides are essentially novel chemical compounds, target pests can manifest resistance soon after these compounds are introduced. Inspired by recent advances in medical research, we propose an ecologically inspired paradigm in pest management through pesticide use that capitalizes on competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and pesticide-resistant individuals. This principle relies on a reactive use of pesticides, constantly tracking pest response, promoting the containment of the pest population below economic injury levels, and buffering resistant individuals proliferation. Using a mathematical model, we show that containing pests abundance at critical levels, instead of seeking immediate eradication, diminishes management failure by reducing resistant individuals growth rates, and consequently the time until resistant-pest dominance. Therefore, management strategies that maximize the abundance of pesticide-sensitive individuals, or explore the potential competitive ability of these populations, can hamper resistance proliferation. Ultimately, these insights reconcile key challenges in environmental management, emphasizing the importance of managing threats to the food production systems using a proactive ecological and evolutionary-informed approach. They also highlight several opportunities for new experimental and theoretical research into the ecological facet of pesticide resistance.\nDevelopment and deployment of improved Anopheles gambiae s.l. field surveillance by adaptive spatial sampling design\nAuthors: Monteiro, G. M.; Djogbenou, L. S.; Donnelly, M. J.; Sedda, L.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-06-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545360\nAccurate assessments of vector occurrence and abundance, particularly in widespread vector-borne diseases such as malaria, is essential for efficient deployment of disease surveillance and control interventions. This study emphasizes the need for flexible spatial sampling designs that can capture the dynamic relationships between disease vector species and the environment. Although previous studies have examined the benefits of adaptive sampling for disease hotspot identification (mostly by simulations), limited research has been conducted on field surveillance of malaria vectors. Here, an adaptive spatial sampling design targeting potential and uncertain An. gambiae hotspots, a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is presented. The first phase of the proposed design involved ecological zone delineation and a proportional lattice with close pairs sampling design to maximise spatial coverage, representativeness of ecological zones and vector spatial autocorrelation (by the employment of close pairs). In the second phase, a spatial adaptive sampling design targeted high-risk areas with the largest uncertainty. For the second phase, the sample size was reduced compared to the first phase, but predictions improved for out-of-sample and training data. However, the overall model uncertainty increased, highlighting the trade-off in multi-criteria adaptive sampling designs. It is important that future research focuses on these trade-offs to reduce the timescale for effective malaria control and elimination efforts.\nCan leafhoppers help us trace the impact of climate change on agriculture?\nAuthors: Plante, N.; Durivage, J.; Brochu, A.-S.; Dumonceaux, T.; Torres, D.; Bahder, B.; Kits, J.; Dionne, A.; Legare, J.-P.; Tellier, S.; McCune, F.; Goulet, C.; Fournier, V.; Perez-Lopez, E.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-06-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544773\nSUMMARYClimate change is reshaping agriculture and insect biodiversity worldwide. With rising temperatures, insect species with narrow thermal margins are expected to be pushed beyond their thermal limits, and losses related to herbivory and diseases transmitted by them will be experienced in new regions. Several previous studies have investigated this phenomenon in tropical and temperate regions, locally and globally; however, here, it is proposed that climate changes impact on agriculture can be traced through the study of Nearctic migratory insects, specifically leafhoppers. To test this hypothesis, leafhoppers in strawberry fields located in the province of Quebec, eastern Canada, were evaluated. The strawberry-leafhopper pathosystem offers a unique opportunity because leafhoppers can transmit, among other diseases, strawberry green petal disease (SbGP), which is associated with pathogenic phytoplasmas. Here, we found that in the last ten years, the number of leafhoppers has been increasing in correspondence with the number of SbGP cases detected in eastern Canada, reporting for the first time ten species new to eastern Canada and two to the country, although the leafhopper diversity has been seriously affected. Our model using more than 34 000 leafhoppers showed that their abundance is influenced by temperature, a factor that we found also influences the microbiome associated with Macrosteles quadrilineatus, which was one of the most abundant leafhoppers we observed. One of our most striking findings is that none of the insecticides used by strawberry growers can control leafhopper incidence, which could be linked to microbiome changes induced by changing temperatures. We suggest that Nearctic leafhoppers can be used as sentinels to trace the multilayered effects of climate change in agriculture.

In this study, we explored leafhoppers, a group of agriculturally important insect pests and disease vectors, as sentinels of the effect of climate change on agriculture. Our findings indicate that this group of insects can help us to understand the effect of the current climate crisis on insect invasions, diversity, abundance, disease dynamics and insecticide resistance and to take quick action to ensure food security while achieving more sustainable agriculture.

D.; Fischer, M. S.; Traxler, M. F.; Whitman, T.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545992\nWildfires can either negatively impact soil carbon (C) stocks through combustion or increase soil carbon stocks through the production of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM), which is highly persistent and can affect non-pyrogenic soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization rates. In this study, we used fine-resolution 13CO2 flux tracing to investigate PyOM-C mineralization, soil priming effects, and their impacts on soil microbial communities in a Californian mixed conifer forest Xerumbrept soil burned in the 2014 King Fire. We added PyOM produced from pine biomass at 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C to the soil and separately traced the mineralization of 13C-labeled water-extractable and non-water-extractable PyOM-C fractions in a short-term incubation. Our results indicate that the water-extractable fraction is 10-50x more mineralizable in both 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C PyOM treatments than the SOC or non-water-extractable PyOM fraction. 350 {degrees}C PyOM addition led to a short-term positive priming effect, likely due to co-metabolism of easily mineralizable PyOM-C and the SOC, whereas 550 {degrees}C PyOM addition induced negative priming, potentially due to physical protection of SOC. We observed significant shifts in bacterial community composition in response to both 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C PyOM, with positive PyOM responders belonging to the genera Noviherbaspirillum, Pseudonocardia, and Gemmatimonas. In contrast, fungal communities were less responsive to PyOM additions. Our findings expand our understanding of the post-fire cycling of PyOM and SOC, providing insights into the microbial mineralization of different PyOM-C fractions and their influence on soil C dynamics in fire-affected ecosystems.\nClosed ecosystems extract energy through self-organized nutrient cycles\nAuthors: Goyal, A.; Flamholz, A. I.; Petroff, A. P.; Murugan, A.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-06-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.542875\nOur planet is roughly closed to matter, but open to energy input from the sun. However, to harness this energy, organisms must transform matter from one chemical ( redox) state to another. For example, photosynthetic organisms can capture light energy by carrying out a pair of electron donor and acceptor transformations (e.g., water to oxygen, CO2 to organic carbon). Closure of ecosystems to matter requires that all such transformations are ultimately balanced, i.e., other organisms must carry out corresponding reverse transformations, resulting in cycles that are coupled to each other. A sustainable closed ecosystem thus requires self-organized cycles of matter, in which every transformation has sufficient thermodynamic favorability to maintain an adequate number of organisms carrying out that process. Here, we propose a new conceptual model that explains the self-organization and emergent features of closed ecosystems. We study this model with varying levels of metabolic diversity and energy input, finding that several thermodynamic features converge across ecosystems. Specifically, irrespective of their species composition, large and metabolically diverse communities self-organize to extract {approx} 10% of the maximum extractable energy, or {approx} 100 fold more than randomized communities. Moreover, distinct communities implement energy extraction in convergent ways, as indicated by strongly correlated fluxes through nutrient cycles. As the driving force from light increases, however, these features - fluxes and total energy extraction - become more variable across communities, indicating that energy limitation imposes tight thermodynamic constraints on collective metabolism.\nGeographic distribution of terpenoid chemotypes in Tanacetum vulgare mediates tansy aphid occurrence and abundance\nAuthors: Rahimova, H.; Neuhaus-Harr, A.; Clancy, M. V.; Guo, Y.; Junker, R. R.; Ojeda-Prieto, L.; Petren, H.; Senft, M.; Zytynska, S. E.; Weisser, W. W.; Heinen, R.; Schnitzler, J.-P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545570\nAimIntraspecific variations of specialized metabolites in plants, such as terpenoids, are used to determine chemotypes. Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) exhibits diverse terpenoid profiles, that affect insect communities. However, it is not fully known whether patterns of their chemical composition and associated insects vary on a large scale. Here, we investigated the geographic distribution of mono- and sesquiterpenoid chemotypes in tansy leaves and the effects of these chemotypes on colonization by insect communities across Germany. MethodsWe sampled tansy leaves from 26 sites along a north-south and west-east transect in Germany. Leaves from ten plants with and five plants without aphids was collected from each site. Hexane-extracted metabolites from leaf tissues were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Plant morphological traits, aphid occurrence and abundance, and occurrence of ants were recorded. The effect of plant chemotype, plant morphological parameters, and site parameters such as temperature and precipitation on insect occurrences were analysed. ResultsPlants clustered into four monoterpenoid and four sesquiterpenoid chemotype classes. Monoterpene classes differed in their latitudinal distribution, whereas sesquiterpenes were more evenly distributed across the transect. Aphid and ant occurrence were influenced by monoterpenoids and specific traits. Plants of monoterpenoid class 1 were colonized by Metopeurum fuscoviride and ants significantly more often than expected by chance compared to plants from monoterpenoid class 4. Aphid abundance was negatively affected by host plant height, and increasing average annual temperature positively influenced the occurrence of ants. ConclusionWe found significant geographic differences in the chemodiversity of tansy and show that monoterpenoids affect aphid and ant occurrence, while host plant height can influence aphid abundance. We show that geographic variation in plant chemistry and morphology influences insect communities assemblage on tansy plants.\nWildlife vaccination strategies for eliminating bovine tuberculosis at the wildlife-livestock interface\nAuthors: Pandey, A.; Feuka, A. B.; Cosgrove, M.; Moriarty, M.; Duffiney, A.; VerCauteren, K. C.; Campa, H.; Pepin, K. M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546040\nMany pathogens of humans and livestock also infect wildlife that can act as a reservoir and challenge disease control or elimination. Efficient and effective prioritization of research and management actions requires an understanding of the potential for new tools to improve elimination probability with feasible deployment strategies that can be implemented at scale. Wildlife vaccination is gaining interest as a tool for managing several wildlife diseases. To evaluate the effect of vaccinating white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), in combination with harvest, in reducing and eliminating bovine tuberculosis from deer populations in Michigan, we developed a mechanistic age-structured disease transmission model for bovine tuberculosis with integrated disease management. We evaluated the impact of pulse vaccination across a range of vaccine properties. Pulse vaccination was effective for reducing disease prevalence rapidly with even low (30%) to moderate (60%) vaccine coverage of the susceptible and exposed deer population and was further improved when combined with increased harvest. The impact of increased harvest depended on the relative strength of transmission modes, i.e., direct vs indirect transmission. Vaccine coverage and efficacy were the most important vaccine properties for reducing and eliminating disease from the local population. By fitting the model to the core endemic area of bovine tuberculosis in Michigan, USA, we identified feasible integrated management strategies involving vaccination and increased harvest that reduced disease prevalence in free-ranging deer. Few scenarios led to disease elimination due to the chronic nature of bovine tuberculosis. A long-term commitment to regular vaccination campaigns, and further research on increasing vaccines efficacy and uptake rate in free-ranging deer are important for disease management.\nLife-history traits, pace of life and dispersal among and within five species of Trichogramma wasps: a comparative analysis\nAuthors: Guicharnaud, C.; Groussier, G.; Beranger, E.; Lamy, L.; Vercken, E.; Dahirel, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.24.525360\nMajor traits defining the life history of organisms are often not independent from each other, with most of their variation aligning along key axes such as the pace-of-life axis. We can define a pace-of-life axis structuring reproduction and development time as a continuum from less-fecund, longer-developing slow types to more-fecund, shorter-developing fast types. Such axes, along with their potential associations or syndromes with other traits such as dispersal, are however not universal; in particular, support for their presence may be taxon and taxonomic scale-dependent. Knowing about such life-history strategies may be especially important for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, as these trait syndromes may constrain trait variation or be correlated with other traits. To understand how life-history traits and effective dispersal covary, we measured these traits in controlled conditions for 28 lines from five species of Trichogramma, which are small endoparasitoid wasps frequently used as a biological model in experimental evolution but also in biocontrol against Lepidoptera pests. We found partial evidence of a pace-of-life axis at the interspecific level: species with higher fecundity also had faster development time. However, faster-developing species also were more likely to delay egg-laying, a trait that is usually interpreted as \"slow\". There was no support for similar covariation patterns at the within-species line level. There was limited variation in effective dispersal between species and lines, and accordingly, we did not detect any correlation between effective dispersal probability and life-history traits. We discuss how expanding our experimental design by accounting for the density-dependence of both the pace of life and dispersal might improve our understanding of those traits and how they interact with each other. Overall, our results highlight the importance of exploring covariation at the \"right\" taxonomic scale, or multiple taxonomic scales, to understand the (co)evolution of life-history traits. They also suggest that optimizing both reproductive and development traits to maximize the efficiency of biocontrol may be difficult in programs using only one species.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Marine microorganisms form complex communities of interacting organisms that influence central ecosystem functions in the ocean such as primary production and nutrient cycling. Identifying the mechanisms controlling their assembly and activities is a major challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we integrated Tara Oceans meta-omics data to predict genome-scale community interactions within prokaryotic assemblages in the euphotic ocean. A global genome-resolved co-activity network revealed a significant number of inter-lineage associations across large phylogenetic distances. Identified co-active communities included species displaying smaller genomes but encoding a higher potential for quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism. Community metabolic modelling revealed a higher potential for interaction within co-active communities and pointed towards conserved metabolic cross-feedings, in particular of specific amino acids and group B vitamins. Our integrated ecological and metabolic modelling approach indicates genome streamlining and metabolic auxotrophies as central joint mechanisms shaping bacterioplankton community assembly in the surface global ocean.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most ecological models are based on the assumption that species interact in pairs. Emerging in diverse communities, however, are higher-order interactions, in which two or more species jointly impact the growth of a third species. A pitfall of the pairwise approach is that it misses the higher-order interactions potentially responsible for maintaining diversity in nature. Here, we explore how well higher-order interactions enable coexistence when pairwise interactions are insufficient to do so. Specifically, we explore the stability properties of systems where higher-order interactions guarantee that a specified set of abundances are a feasible equilibrium of the dynamics. Even these higher-order interactions do not necessarily produce robust coexistence. We find that facilitative higher-order interactions that counter pairwise competitive interactions are less likely to generate stable equilibria than competitive interactions countering pairwise facilitation. In both cases the system is more likely to be stable when the pairwise interactions are weak, and when the equilibrium abundances are near those produced by the pairwise interactions. Last, we show that correlations between the pairwise and higher-order interactions permit robust coexistence in diverse systems. Our work reveals the challenges in generating stable coexistence through higher-order interactions, but also uncovers higher-order interaction patterns that can enable diversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Modern agriculture is dependent on the efficacy of pesticides in controlling pests. However, such efficacy is threatened by the evolution of resistance. Although pesticides are essentially novel chemical compounds, target pests can manifest resistance soon after these compounds are introduced. Inspired by recent advances in medical research, we propose an ecologically inspired paradigm in pest management through pesticide use that capitalizes on competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and pesticide-resistant individuals. This principle relies on a reactive use of pesticides, constantly tracking pest response, promoting the containment of the pest population below economic injury levels, and buffering resistant individuals proliferation. Using a mathematical model, we show that containing pests abundance at critical levels, instead of seeking immediate eradication, diminishes management failure by reducing resistant individuals growth rates, and consequently the time until resistant-pest dominance. Therefore, management strategies that maximize the abundance of pesticide-sensitive individuals, or explore the potential competitive ability of these populations, can hamper resistance proliferation. Ultimately, these insights reconcile key challenges in environmental management, emphasizing the importance of managing threats to the food production systems using a proactive ecological and evolutionary-informed approach. They also highlight several opportunities for new experimental and theoretical research into the ecological facet of pesticide resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate assessments of vector occurrence and abundance, particularly in widespread vector-borne diseases such as malaria, is essential for efficient deployment of disease surveillance and control interventions. This study emphasizes the need for flexible spatial sampling designs that can capture the dynamic relationships between disease vector species and the environment. Although previous studies have examined the benefits of adaptive sampling for disease hotspot identification (mostly by simulations), limited research has been conducted on field surveillance of malaria vectors. Here, an adaptive spatial sampling design targeting potential and uncertain An. gambiae hotspots, a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is presented. The first phase of the proposed design involved ecological zone delineation and a proportional lattice with close pairs sampling design to maximise spatial coverage, representativeness of ecological zones and vector spatial autocorrelation (by the employment of close pairs). In the second phase, a spatial adaptive sampling design targeted high-risk areas with the largest uncertainty. For the second phase, the sample size was reduced compared to the first phase, but predictions improved for out-of-sample and training data. However, the overall model uncertainty increased, highlighting the trade-off in multi-criteria adaptive sampling designs. It is important that future research focuses on these trade-offs to reduce the timescale for effective malaria control and elimination efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SUMMARYClimate change is reshaping agriculture and insect biodiversity worldwide. With rising temperatures, insect species with narrow thermal margins are expected to be pushed beyond their thermal limits, and losses related to herbivory and diseases transmitted by them will be experienced in new regions. Several previous studies have investigated this phenomenon in tropical and temperate regions, locally and globally; however, here, it is proposed that climate changes impact on agriculture can be traced through the study of Nearctic migratory insects, specifically leafhoppers. To test this hypothesis, leafhoppers in strawberry fields located in the province of Quebec, eastern Canada, were evaluated. The strawberry-leafhopper pathosystem offers a unique opportunity because leafhoppers can transmit, among other diseases, strawberry green petal disease (SbGP), which is associated with pathogenic phytoplasmas. Here, we found that in the last ten years, the number of leafhoppers has been increasing in correspondence with the number of SbGP cases detected in eastern Canada, reporting for the first time ten species new to eastern Canada and two to the country, although the leafhopper diversity has been seriously affected. Our model using more than 34 000 leafhoppers showed that their abundance is influenced by temperature, a factor that we found also influences the microbiome associated with Macrosteles quadrilineatus, which was one of the most abundant leafhoppers we observed. One of our most striking findings is that none of the insecticides used by strawberry growers can control leafhopper incidence, which could be linked to microbiome changes induced by changing temperatures. We suggest that Nearctic leafhoppers can be used as sentinels to trace the multilayered effects of climate change in agriculture.

In this study, we explored leafhoppers, a group of agriculturally important insect pests and disease vectors, as sentinels of the effect of climate change on agriculture. Our findings indicate that this group of insects can help us to understand the effect of the current climate crisis on insect invasions, diversity, abundance, disease dynamics and insecticide resistance and to take quick action to ensure food security while achieving more sustainable agriculture.

        <p class="abstract">Wildfires can either negatively impact soil carbon (C) stocks through combustion or increase soil carbon stocks through the production of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM), which is highly persistent and can affect non-pyrogenic soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization rates. In this study, we used fine-resolution 13CO2 flux tracing to investigate PyOM-C mineralization, soil priming effects, and their impacts on soil microbial communities in a Californian mixed conifer forest Xerumbrept soil burned in the 2014 King Fire. We added PyOM produced from pine biomass at 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C to the soil and separately traced the mineralization of 13C-labeled water-extractable and non-water-extractable PyOM-C fractions in a short-term incubation.

Our results indicate that the water-extractable fraction is 10-50x more mineralizable in both 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C PyOM treatments than the SOC or non-water-extractable PyOM fraction. 350 {degrees}C PyOM addition led to a short-term positive priming effect, likely due to co-metabolism of easily mineralizable PyOM-C and the SOC, whereas 550 {degrees}C PyOM addition induced negative priming, potentially due to physical protection of SOC. We observed significant shifts in bacterial community composition in response to both 350 {degrees}C and 550 {degrees}C PyOM, with positive PyOM responders belonging to the genera Noviherbaspirillum, Pseudonocardia, and Gemmatimonas. In contrast, fungal communities were less responsive to PyOM additions. Our findings expand our understanding of the post-fire cycling of PyOM and SOC, providing insights into the microbial mineralization of different PyOM-C fractions and their influence on soil C dynamics in fire-affected ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our planet is roughly closed to matter, but open to energy input from the sun. However, to harness this energy, organisms must transform matter from one chemical ( redox) state to another. For example, photosynthetic organisms can capture light energy by carrying out a pair of electron donor and acceptor transformations (e.g., water to oxygen, CO2 to organic carbon). Closure of ecosystems to matter requires that all such transformations are ultimately balanced, i.e., other organisms must carry out corresponding reverse transformations, resulting in cycles that are coupled to each other. A sustainable closed ecosystem thus requires self-organized cycles of matter, in which every transformation has sufficient thermodynamic favorability to maintain an adequate number of organisms carrying out that process. Here, we propose a new conceptual model that explains the self-organization and emergent features of closed ecosystems. We study this model with varying levels of metabolic diversity and energy input, finding that several thermodynamic features converge across ecosystems. Specifically, irrespective of their species composition, large and metabolically diverse communities self-organize to extract {approx} 10% of the maximum extractable energy, or {approx} 100 fold more than randomized communities. Moreover, distinct communities implement energy extraction in convergent ways, as indicated by strongly correlated fluxes through nutrient cycles. As the driving force from light increases, however, these features - fluxes and total energy extraction - become more variable across communities, indicating that energy limitation imposes tight thermodynamic constraints on collective metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimIntraspecific variations of specialized metabolites in plants, such as terpenoids, are used to determine chemotypes. Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) exhibits diverse terpenoid profiles, that affect insect communities. However, it is not fully known whether patterns of their chemical composition and associated insects vary on a large scale. Here, we investigated the geographic distribution of mono- and sesquiterpenoid chemotypes in tansy leaves and the effects of these chemotypes on colonization by insect communities across Germany.

MethodsWe sampled tansy leaves from 26 sites along a north-south and west-east transect in Germany. Leaves from ten plants with and five plants without aphids was collected from each site. Hexane-extracted metabolites from leaf tissues were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Plant morphological traits, aphid occurrence and abundance, and occurrence of ants were recorded. The effect of plant chemotype, plant morphological parameters, and site parameters such as temperature and precipitation on insect occurrences were analysed.

ResultsPlants clustered into four monoterpenoid and four sesquiterpenoid chemotype classes. Monoterpene classes differed in their latitudinal distribution, whereas sesquiterpenes were more evenly distributed across the transect. Aphid and ant occurrence were influenced by monoterpenoids and specific traits. Plants of monoterpenoid class 1 were colonized by Metopeurum fuscoviride and ants significantly more often than expected by chance compared to plants from monoterpenoid class 4. Aphid abundance was negatively affected by host plant height, and increasing average annual temperature positively influenced the occurrence of ants.

ConclusionWe found significant geographic differences in the chemodiversity of tansy and show that monoterpenoids affect aphid and ant occurrence, while host plant height can influence aphid abundance. We show that geographic variation in plant chemistry and morphology influences insect communities assemblage on tansy plants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many pathogens of humans and livestock also infect wildlife that can act as a reservoir and challenge disease control or elimination. Efficient and effective prioritization of research and management actions requires an understanding of the potential for new tools to improve elimination probability with feasible deployment strategies that can be implemented at scale. Wildlife vaccination is gaining interest as a tool for managing several wildlife diseases. To evaluate the effect of vaccinating white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), in combination with harvest, in reducing and eliminating bovine tuberculosis from deer populations in Michigan, we developed a mechanistic age-structured disease transmission model for bovine tuberculosis with integrated disease management. We evaluated the impact of pulse vaccination across a range of vaccine properties. Pulse vaccination was effective for reducing disease prevalence rapidly with even low (30%) to moderate (60%) vaccine coverage of the susceptible and exposed deer population and was further improved when combined with increased harvest. The impact of increased harvest depended on the relative strength of transmission modes, i.e., direct vs indirect transmission. Vaccine coverage and efficacy were the most important vaccine properties for reducing and eliminating disease from the local population. By fitting the model to the core endemic area of bovine tuberculosis in Michigan, USA, we identified feasible integrated management strategies involving vaccination and increased harvest that reduced disease prevalence in free-ranging deer. Few scenarios led to disease elimination due to the chronic nature of bovine tuberculosis. A long-term commitment to regular vaccination campaigns, and further research on increasing vaccines efficacy and uptake rate in free-ranging deer are important for disease management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Major traits defining the life history of organisms are often not independent from each other, with most of their variation aligning along key axes such as the pace-of-life axis. We can define a pace-of-life axis structuring reproduction and development time as a continuum from less-fecund, longer-developing  slow types to more-fecund, shorter-developing  fast types. Such axes, along with their potential associations or syndromes with other traits such as dispersal, are however not universal; in particular, support for their presence may be taxon and taxonomic scale-dependent. Knowing about such life-history strategies may be especially important for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, as these trait syndromes may constrain trait variation or be correlated with other traits. To understand how life-history traits and effective dispersal covary, we measured these traits in controlled conditions for 28 lines from five species of Trichogramma, which are small endoparasitoid wasps frequently used as a biological model in experimental evolution but also in biocontrol against Lepidoptera pests. We found partial evidence of a pace-of-life axis at the interspecific level: species with higher fecundity also had faster development time. However, faster-developing species also were more likely to delay egg-laying, a trait that is usually interpreted as &#34;slow&#34;. There was no support for similar covariation patterns at the within-species line level. There was limited variation in effective dispersal between species and lines, and accordingly, we did not detect any correlation between effective dispersal probability and life-history traits. We discuss how expanding our experimental design by accounting for the density-dependence of both the pace of life and dispersal might improve our understanding of those traits and how they interact with each other. Overall, our results highlight the importance of exploring covariation at the &#34;right&#34; taxonomic scale, or multiple taxonomic scales, to understand the (co)evolution of life-history traits. They also suggest that optimizing both reproductive and development traits to maximize the efficiency of biocontrol may be difficult in programs using only one species.</p>
