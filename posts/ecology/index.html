J.; Gibbons, S. M.\nScore: 51.9, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552554\nPrior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.\nComparative abundance and diversity of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae and Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae species complexes throughout the Durance River catchment from its French Alps sources to its delta\nAuthors: Morris, C. E.; Lacroix, C.; Chandeysson, C.; Guilbaud, C.; Monteil, C.; Piry, S.; Rochelle-Newall, E.; Fiorini, S.; Van Gijsegem, F.; Barny, M.-A.; Berge, O.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2022.09.06.506731\nRivers, creeks, streams are integrators of biological, chemical and physical processes occurring in a catchment linking land cover from the headwaters to the outlet. The dynamics of human and animal pathogens in catchments have been widely studied in a large variety of contexts allowing the optimization of disease risk reduction. In parallel, there is an emerging awareness that crop pathogens might also be disseminated via surface waters especially when they are used for irrigation. However, there are no studies on the extent to which potential plant pathogens are present - nor about their dynamics - along the full course of a catchment. Here we have compared the seasonal dynamics of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) and the Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) species complexes along a 270 km stretch of the Durance River from the upstream alpine reaches to the downstream agricultural production areas at the confluence with the Rhone River at Avignon. Among 168 samples collected at 21 sites in fall, winter, spring and summer of 2016 and 2017, Psy strains were detected at all sampling sites and in 156 of the samples at population densities up to 105 bacteria L-1. In contrast, SRP strains were detected in 98 of the samples, mostly from the southern part of the river, at population densities that did not exceed 3 x 104 bacteria L-1. Among the biological and chemical parameters that were characterized at each sampling site, temperature was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variability in population size for both species complexes. Psy densities decreased with increasing temperature whereas SRP densities increased with increasing temperature. River-borne populations of SRP were composed mainly of Pectobacterium versatile and P. aquaticum that have little known epidemiological importance. Only a few strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya species reputed for their epidemiological impact were observed. In contrast, Psy populations at all sites were dominated by a genetic lineage of phylogroup 2 known from other studies for its broad host range and its geographic and habitat ubiquity. Our observations suggest that surveillance of river water for SRP could be leveraged to signal diagnostic and management reactions to avoid disease outbreaks. In contrast, the constant presence of Psy throughout the catchment in absence of regular and widespread disease outbreaks due to this group of bacteria suggests that surveillance should focus on future changes in land use, river water conditions and agronomic practices that could destabilize the mechanisms currently holding Psy outbreaks in check.\nTick-borne zoonotic flaviviruses and Borrelia infections in wildlife hosts: what have field studies contributed?\nAuthors: Poisson, A.; Boulinier, T.; Bournez, L.; Gonzalez, G.; Migne, C. V.; Moutailler, S.; Faivre, B.; Metras, R.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554822\nTick-borne flaviviruses and Borrelia spp. are globally spread pathogens of zoonotic potential which are maintained by a transmission cycle at the interface between ticks and vertebrate hosts, mainly wild animals. We reviewed how those infections have been studied in wildlife species in the field to discuss how collected data provided relevant epidemiological information and identify needs for further studies. The literature was screened for populational studies on direct or antibody detection for tick-borne Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses in animals, in the wild. Overall, Borrelia spp. were more studied (73% of case studies, representing 297 host species) than flaviviruses (27% of case studies, representing 114 host species). Studies on both Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses focused mainly on the same species (namely bank vole and yellow-necked mouse). Species with potential to act as reservoir hosts were overlooked, notably passerine birds. Most studies were order-specific and cross-sectional. We highlight the necessity of collecting both demographics and infection data in wildlife studies, and to consider communities of species, to better estimate zoonotic risk potential.\nProvision of essential resources as a persistence strategy in food webs\nAuthors: Raatz, M.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.27.525839\nPairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.\nSocial network centrality predicts dietary decisions in a wild bird population\nAuthors: McMahon, K.; Marples, N. M.; Spurgin, L. G.; Rowland, H. M.; Sheldon, B. S.; Firth, J. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554636\nHow individuals balance costs and benefits of group living remains central to understanding sociality. In relation to diet, social foraging provides many advantages but also increases competition. Nevertheless, social individuals may offset increased competition by broadening their diet and consuming novel foods. Despite the expected relationships between social behaviour and dietary decisions, how sociality shapes individuals' novel food consumption remains largely untested in natural populations. Here, we use wild, RFID-tracked, great tits to experimentally test how sociality predicts dietary decisions. We show that individuals with more social connections have higher propensity to use novel foods compared to socially-peripheral individuals, and this is unrelated to neophobia, observations, and demographic factors. These findings indicate sociable individuals may offset potential costs of competition by foraging more broadly. We discuss how social environments may drive behavioural change in natural populations, and the implications for the causes and consequences of social strategies and dietary decisions.\nIntegrating habitat suitability modeling with gene flow improves delineation of landscape connections among African savanna elephants\nAuthors: de Flamingh, A.; Alexander, N.; Perrin-Stowe, T.; Donnelly, C.; Guldemondt, R.; Schooley, R.; van Aarde, R.; Roca, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554325\nAcross Africa, space for conservation is sometimes limited to formally protected areas that have become progressively more isolated. There is a need for targeted conservation initiatives such as the demarcation of landscape connections, defined as areas that encompass environmental variables that promote the natural movement of individuals between populations, which can facilitate gene flow. Landscape connections can mitigate genetic isolation, genetic drift, and inbreeding, which can occur in isolated populations in protected areas. Promoting gene flow can reduce the risk of extirpation often associated with isolated populations. Here we develop and test models for identifying landscape connections among African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations by combining habitat suitability modeling with gene flow estimates across a large region including seven countries. We find a pronounced non-linear response to unsuitable habitat, consistent with previous studies showing that non-transformed habitat models are poor predictors of gene flow. We generated a landscape connections map that considers both suitable habitats based on telemetry occurrence data and gene flow estimated as the inverse of individual genetic distance, delineating areas that are important for maintaining elephant population connectivity. Our approach represents a novel framework for developing spatially and genetically informed conservation strategies for elephants and many other taxa distributed across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes.

M.; Tamames, J.; Pedros-Alio, C.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550202\nThe ecological role of microorganisms is of utmost importance due to their multiple interactions with the environment. However, assessing the contribution of individual taxonomic groups has proven difficult despite the availability of high throughput data, hindering our understanding of such complex systems. Here, we propose a quantitative definition of guild that is readily applicable to metagenomic data. Our framework focuses on the functional character of protein sequences, as well as their diversifying nature. First, we discriminate functional sequences from the whole sequence space corresponding to a gene annotation to then quantify their contribution to the guild composition across environments. In addition, we distinguish between sequence spaces that have different ways of carrying out the function. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by quantifying the guild of ammonia oxidation, and further reveal novel ecological dynamics of putrescine uptake guild in marine ecosystems. Thus, guilds help elucidate the functional role of different taxonomic groups with profound implications in the study of microbial communities.\nMapping the landscape pool of ardeid species to landscape structure associated with Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia\nAuthors: Walsh, M.; Webb, C. E.; Brookes, V.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553798\nThe geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.\nUncertainty propagation in matrix population models: gaps, importance, and guidelines\nAuthors: Simmonds, E. G.; Jones, O. R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554793\nMatrix population models (MPMs), which describe the demographic behaviour of a population based on age or stage through discrete time, are popular in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology. MPMs provide a tool for guiding management decisions and can give insight into life history trade-offs, patterns of senescence, transient dynamics, and population trajectories. These models are parameterised with estimates of vital rates (e.g. survival and reproduction) and can have multiple layers of underlying statistical analyses, all of which introduce uncertainty. For accurate and transparent results, this uncertainty should be propagated through to quantities derived from the MPMs. However, full propagation is not always achieved, leading to omitted uncertainty, and negative consequences for the reliability of inferences drawn. We summarised the state-of-the-art regarding vital rate uncertainty reporting and propagation, by reviewing papers using MPMs from 2010-2019. We then used reported uncertainties as the basis for a simulation study to explore the impact of uncertainty omission on inferences drawn from the analysis of MPMs. We simulated four scenarios of vital rate propagation and evaluated their impact on population growth rate estimates. Although around 78% of MPM papers report some kind of uncertainty in their findings, only half of those report uncertainty in all aspects. Additionally, only 31% of papers fully propagate uncertainty through to derived quantities. Our simulations demonstrate that, even under a median uncertainty level, incomplete propagation introduces bias. Omitting uncertainty may substantially alter conclusions, particularly for results showing small changes in population size. Biased conclusions were most common when uncertainty in the most influential vital rates for population growth were omitted. We suggest comprehensive guidelines for reporting and propagating uncertainty in MPMs. Standardising methods and reporting will increase the reliability of MPMs and enhance the comparability of different models. These guidelines will improve the accuracy, transparency, and reliability of population projections, increasing our confidence in results that can inform conservation efforts, ultimately contributing to biodiversity preservation.\nInteractions between temperature and nutrients determine the population dynamics of primary producers\nAuthors: Bieg, C.; Vasseur, D.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554290\nGlobal change is rapidly and fundamentally altering many of the processes regulating the flux of energy throughout ecosystems and although researchers now understand the effect of temperature on key rates (such as aquatic primary productivity), the theoretical foundation needed to generate forecasts of biomass dynamics and extinction risk remains underdeveloped. We develop new theory that describes the interconnected effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton populations and show that the thermal response of equilibrium biomass (i.e., carrying capacity) always peaks at a lower temperature than for productivity (i.e., growth rate). This difference results from trade-offs between the thermal responses of growth, death, and per-capita impact on the nutrient pool, making this thermal mismatch highly general and applicable to widely used population models. We further show that non-equilibrium dynamics depend on the pace of environmental change relative to underlying vital rates, and that populations respond to variable environments differently at high vs. low temperatures due to thermal asymmetries.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Prior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rivers, creeks, streams are integrators of biological, chemical and physical processes occurring in a catchment linking land cover from the headwaters to the outlet. The dynamics of human and animal pathogens in catchments have been widely studied in a large variety of contexts allowing the optimization of disease risk reduction. In parallel, there is an emerging awareness that crop pathogens might also be disseminated via surface waters especially when they are used for irrigation. However, there are no studies on the extent to which potential plant pathogens are present - nor about their dynamics - along the full course of a catchment. Here we have compared the seasonal dynamics of populations of the Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) and the Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) species complexes along a 270 km stretch of the Durance River from the upstream alpine reaches to the downstream agricultural production areas at the confluence with the Rhone River at Avignon. Among 168 samples collected at 21 sites in fall, winter, spring and summer of 2016 and 2017, Psy strains were detected at all sampling sites and in 156 of the samples at population densities up to 105 bacteria L-1. In contrast, SRP strains were detected in 98 of the samples, mostly from the southern part of the river, at population densities that did not exceed 3 x 104 bacteria L-1. Among the biological and chemical parameters that were characterized at each sampling site, temperature was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variability in population size for both species complexes. Psy densities decreased with increasing temperature whereas SRP densities increased with increasing temperature. River-borne populations of SRP were composed mainly of Pectobacterium versatile and P. aquaticum that have little known epidemiological importance. Only a few strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya species reputed for their epidemiological impact were observed. In contrast, Psy populations at all sites were dominated by a genetic lineage of phylogroup 2 known from other studies for its broad host range and its geographic and habitat ubiquity. Our observations suggest that surveillance of river water for SRP could be leveraged to signal diagnostic and management reactions to avoid disease outbreaks. In contrast, the constant presence of Psy throughout the catchment in absence of regular and widespread disease outbreaks due to this group of bacteria suggests that surveillance should focus on future changes in land use, river water conditions and agronomic practices that could destabilize the mechanisms currently holding Psy outbreaks in check.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tick-borne flaviviruses and Borrelia spp. are globally spread pathogens of zoonotic potential which are maintained by a transmission cycle at the interface between ticks and vertebrate hosts, mainly wild animals. We reviewed how those infections have been studied in wildlife species in the field to discuss how collected data provided relevant epidemiological information and identify needs for further studies. The literature was screened for populational studies on direct or antibody detection for tick-borne Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses in animals, in the wild. Overall, Borrelia spp. were more studied (73% of case studies, representing 297 host species) than flaviviruses (27% of case studies, representing 114 host species). Studies on both Borrelia spp. and flaviviruses focused mainly on the same species (namely bank vole and yellow-necked mouse). Species with potential to act as reservoir hosts were overlooked, notably passerine birds. Most studies were order-specific and cross-sectional. We highlight the necessity of collecting both demographics and infection data in wildlife studies, and to consider communities of species, to better estimate zoonotic risk potential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How individuals balance costs and benefits of group living remains central to understanding sociality. In relation to diet, social foraging provides many advantages but also increases competition. Nevertheless, social individuals may offset increased competition by broadening their diet and consuming novel foods. Despite the expected relationships between social behaviour and dietary decisions, how sociality shapes individuals&#39; novel food consumption remains largely untested in natural populations. Here, we use wild, RFID-tracked, great tits to experimentally test how sociality predicts dietary decisions. We show that individuals with more social connections have higher propensity to use novel foods compared to socially-peripheral individuals, and this is unrelated to neophobia, observations, and demographic factors. These findings indicate sociable individuals may offset potential costs of competition by foraging more broadly. We discuss how social environments may drive behavioural change in natural populations, and the implications for the causes and consequences of social strategies and dietary decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Across Africa, space for conservation is sometimes limited to formally protected areas that have become progressively more isolated. There is a need for targeted conservation initiatives such as the demarcation of landscape connections, defined as areas that encompass environmental variables that promote the natural movement of individuals between populations, which can facilitate gene flow. Landscape connections can mitigate genetic isolation, genetic drift, and inbreeding, which can occur in isolated populations in protected areas. Promoting gene flow can reduce the risk of extirpation often associated with isolated populations. Here we develop and test models for identifying landscape connections among African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations by combining habitat suitability modeling with gene flow estimates across a large region including seven countries. We find a pronounced non-linear response to unsuitable habitat, consistent with previous studies showing that non-transformed habitat models are poor predictors of gene flow. We generated a landscape connections map that considers both suitable habitats based on telemetry occurrence data and gene flow estimated as the inverse of individual genetic distance, delineating areas that are important for maintaining elephant population connectivity. Our approach represents a novel framework for developing spatially and genetically informed conservation strategies for elephants and many other taxa distributed across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes.

        <p class="abstract">The ecological role of microorganisms is of utmost importance due to their multiple interactions with the environment. However, assessing the contribution of individual taxonomic groups has proven difficult despite the availability of high throughput data, hindering our understanding of such complex systems. Here, we propose a quantitative definition of guild that is readily applicable to metagenomic data. Our framework focuses on the functional character of protein sequences, as well as their diversifying nature. First, we discriminate functional sequences from the whole sequence space corresponding to a gene annotation to then quantify their contribution to the guild composition across environments. In addition, we distinguish between sequence spaces that have different ways of carrying out the function. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by quantifying the guild of ammonia oxidation, and further reveal novel ecological dynamics of putrescine uptake guild in marine ecosystems. Thus, guilds help elucidate the functional role of different taxonomic groups with profound implications in the study of microbial communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Matrix population models (MPMs), which describe the demographic behaviour of a population based on age or stage through discrete time, are popular in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology. MPMs provide a tool for guiding management decisions and can give insight into life history trade-offs, patterns of senescence, transient dynamics, and population trajectories. These models are parameterised with estimates of vital rates (e.g. survival and reproduction) and can have multiple layers of underlying statistical analyses, all of which introduce uncertainty. For accurate and transparent results, this uncertainty should be propagated through to quantities derived from the MPMs. However, full propagation is not always achieved, leading to omitted uncertainty, and negative consequences for the reliability of inferences drawn. We summarised the state-of-the-art regarding vital rate uncertainty reporting and propagation, by reviewing papers using MPMs from 2010-2019. We then used reported uncertainties as the basis for a simulation study to explore the impact of uncertainty omission on inferences drawn from the analysis of MPMs. We simulated four scenarios of vital rate propagation and evaluated their impact on population growth rate estimates. Although around 78% of MPM papers report some kind of uncertainty in their findings, only half of those report uncertainty in all aspects. Additionally, only 31% of papers fully propagate uncertainty through to derived quantities. Our simulations demonstrate that, even under a median uncertainty level, incomplete propagation introduces bias. Omitting uncertainty may substantially alter conclusions, particularly for results showing small changes in population size. Biased conclusions were most common when uncertainty in the most influential vital rates for population growth were omitted. We suggest comprehensive guidelines for reporting and propagating uncertainty in MPMs. Standardising methods and reporting will increase the reliability of MPMs and enhance the comparability of different models. These guidelines will improve the accuracy, transparency, and reliability of population projections, increasing our confidence in results that can inform conservation efforts, ultimately contributing to biodiversity preservation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global change is rapidly and fundamentally altering many of the processes regulating the flux of energy throughout ecosystems and although researchers now understand the effect of temperature on key rates (such as aquatic primary productivity), the theoretical foundation needed to generate forecasts of biomass dynamics and extinction risk remains underdeveloped. We develop new theory that describes the interconnected effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton populations and show that the thermal response of equilibrium biomass (i.e., carrying capacity) always peaks at a lower temperature than for productivity (i.e., growth rate). This difference results from trade-offs between the thermal responses of growth, death, and per-capita impact on the nutrient pool, making this thermal mismatch highly general and applicable to widely used population models. We further show that non-equilibrium dynamics depend on the pace of environmental change relative to underlying vital rates, and that populations respond to variable environments differently at high vs. low temperatures due to thermal asymmetries.</p>
