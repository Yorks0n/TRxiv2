Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention.

However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.\nTesting for reciprocal trait influence in plant-frugivore interactions using generalized joint attribute modeling\nAuthors: Yohe, L. R.; Leiser-Miller, L. B.; Kaliszewska, Z. A.; Whitehead, S. R.; Santana, S. E.; Davalos, L. M.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576112\nUnder an adaptive hypothesis, the reciprocal influence between mutualistic plants and frugivores is expected to result in dispersal syndromes comprising both frugivore and plant traits that structure fruit consumption. Tests of this adaptive hypothesis, however, focus on traits of either fruits or frugivores but not both and often ignore within-species variation. To overcome these limitations, we analyze traits for the mutualistic ecological network comprising Carollia bats that feed on and disperse Piper seeds. For these analyses, we use generalized joint attribute modeling (GJAM), a Bayesian modeling approach that simultaneously accounts for multiple sources of variance across trait types. In support of the adaptive hypothesis and indicating niche partitioning among Carollia bats, we find differential consumption of a suite of Piper species influenced by bat traits such as body size; however, Piper morphological traits had no effect on bat consumption. Slow evolutionary rates, dispersal by other vertebrates, and unexamined fruit traits, such as Piper chemical bouquets, may explain the lack of association between bat Piper consumption and fruit morphological traits. We have identified a potential asymmetric influence of frugivore traits on plant-frugivore interactions, providing a template for future trait analyses of plant-animal networks.\nLinear-regression-based algorithms can succeed at identifying microbial functional groups despite the nonlinearity of ecological function\nAuthors: Zhao, Y.; Cordero, O. X.; Tikhonov, M.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576558\nMicrobial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at de novo discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the EQO approach of Shan et al. [25]). This success seems puzzling, since modeling community function as a linear combination of contributions of individual species appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the \"correct\" grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones. Author summaryNatural microbial communities are highly complex, making predictive modeling difficult. One appealing approach is to make their description less detailed, rendering modeling more tractable while hopefully still retaining some predictive power. The Tree of Life naturally provides one possible method for building coarser descriptions (instead of thousands of strains, we could think about hundreds of species; or dozens of families). However, it is known that useful descriptions need not be taxonomically coherent, as illustrated, for example, by the so-called functional guilds. This prompted the development of computational methods seeking to propose candidate groupings in a data-driven manner. In this computational study, we examine one class of such methods, recently proposed in the microbial context. Quantitatively testing their performance can be difficult, as the answer they \"should\" recover is often unknown. Here, we overcome this difficulty by testing these methods on synthetic data from a model where the ground truth is known by construction. Curiously, we demonstrate that simpler approaches, rather than suffering from this simplicity, can in fact be more robust.\nPhysiological and behavioural resistance of malaria vectors in rural West-Africa : a data mining study to address their fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity, drivers, and predictability\nAuthors: Taconet, P.; SOMA, D. D.; Zogo, B.; Mouline, K.; Simard, F.; Koffi, A. A.; Dabire, R. K.; Pennetier, C.; Moiroux, N.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.20.504631\nInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.\nCan overlooking \"invisible landscapes\" bias habitat selection estimation and population distribution projections?\nAuthors: Dejeante, R.; Lemaire-Patin, R.; Chamaille-Jammes, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576416\nSpecies future distributions are commonly predicted using models that link the likelihood of occurrence of individuals to the environment. Although animals movements are influenced by physical landscapes and individual experiences (for example space familiarity), species distribution models developed from observations of unknown individuals cannot integrate these latter variables, turning them into invisible landscapes. In this theoretical study, we address how overlooking invisible landscapes impacts the estimation of habitat selection and thereby the projection of future distributions. Overlooking the attraction towards some invisible variable consistently led to over-estimating the strength of habitat selection. Consequently, projections of future population distributions were also biased, with animals tracking habitat changes less than predicted. Our results reveal an overlooked challenge faced by correlative species distribution models based on the observation of unknown individuals, whose past experience of the environment is by definition not known. Mechanistic distribution modelling integrating cognitive processes underlying movement should be developed.\nGlobal spatial potential for implementing land-based climate mitigation\nAuthors: Beaury, E. M.; Smith, J.; Levine, J.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574063\nLand-based mitigation strategies (LBMS) are critical to reducing climate change and will require large areas for their implementation. Yet few studies have considered how and where LBMS compete for land or are mutually compatible across Earths surface. We derived high resolution estimates of the spatial distribution of 19 different LBMS. We estimated 8.9 billion ha suitable for LBMS across the Earth, including 5.6 Bha suitable for only one of the studied strategies and 3.3 Bha suitable for multiple LBMS. We identified significant conflicts between better carbon management of existing land cover types, and restoration-based strategies such as reforestation. At the same time, several agricultural management LBMS were compatible over large areas, including for example, enhanced weathering and improved plantation rotations. Our analysis presents local stakeholders, communities, and governments with the range of LBMS options, and the opportunity costs associated with scaling up any given LBMS to reduce global climate change.\nSand flies around Tona, an artificial water reservoir in Bucaramanga (Santander, Colombia): diversity, spatiotemporal frequency, and efficacy of four sampling methods\nAuthors: Rengifo Correa, L.; Castillo, R. M.; Cuadros-Martinez, J.; Galati, E. A. B.; Duque, J. E.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576224\nCharacterizing the sand fly diversity is crucial for an effective design of control strategies for Leishmaniasis. We aimed to characterize the sand fly biodiversity around the Tona Reservoir (Santander, Colombia) and to compare the performance of four sampling methods. A sampling of insects was performed in 2017 in the most preserved and least preserved areas close to the Tona Reservoir, using Torre Vigia-UIS and HomeTrap-UIS, two sticky traps previously designed by our working group, CDC, and Bg-Sentinel traps. We collected 268 Phlebotominae specimens, most with CDC (47.8%) and Torre Vigia-UIS (30.2%) traps. Some specimens (47%) could not be determined because of their preservation status; these samples came mostly from the sticky traps. We found 16 sand fly morphospecies, of which 12 were determined to species level. Here, we report two new records for Santander: Pintomyia youngi (Feliciangeli and Murillo, 1987) and Lutzomyia ceferinoi (Ortiz and Alvarez, 1963). We also collected some confirmed vectors of Leishmania: Pi. youngi, Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu, 1931), and Lu. longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912). The highest diversity was collected in the most disturbed area (15 spp.), and in the rainy season (April, 12 spp.). Pintomyia youngi distribution was broad through the Tona Reservoir in all the sampled periods, and we suggest tracking it to infer leishmaniasis risk in the Tona Reservoir. Torre Vigia-UIS seems a valuable tool for vector control, but we do not recommend it for biodiversity studies.\nThe unseen invaders: tracking phylogeographic dynamics and genetic diversity of cryptic Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata (Golden Apple Snails) across Taiwan\nAuthors: Banerjee, P.; Dey, G.; Maity, J. P.; Stewart, K. A.; Sharma, R. K.; Chan, M. W. Y.; Lee, K. H.; Chen, C.-Y.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576472\nThe cryptic invasion of golden apple snails (Pomacea spp.) in Taiwan has caused significant ecological and economical damage, however, their management remains difficult due to inadequate taxonomic identification, complex phylogeny and limited population genetic information. We aim to understand the current distribution, putative population of origin, genetic diversity and potential path of invasion of Pomacea spp. across Taiwan to aid in improved mitigation approaches. The present investigation conducted a nationwide survey with 254 samples collected from 41 locations from 14 counties or cities across Taiwan. We identified and compared the genetic diversity of P. canaliculata and P. maculata based on mitochondrial COI in Taiwan, as well as other introduced and native countries (publicly available COI data) to understand the possible paths of invasion in Taiwan. Based on mitochondrial COI barcoding, sympatric but heterogeneous distributions of invasive P. canaliculata (widespread) and P. maculata (mostly restricted to Southern Taiwan) were noted. Our haplotype analysis and mismatch distribution suggest multiple introductions of P. canaliculata likely originated directly from Argentina, whereas P. maculata was probably introduced from a single, or a few, introduction event(s) from Argentina and Brazil, instead of directly from Brazil. Our population genetic data further demonstrated higher haplotype and genetic diversity for P. canaliculata and P. maculata in Taiwan compared to other Asian countries, which also suggest multiple introductions affected Taiwan. Comparing the introduction history, current distribution and cryptic nature of P. canaliculata and P. maculata in Taiwan, we posit that P. maculata was likely introduced along with P. canaliculata (either intentionally or unintentionally), whereas, P. canaliculata plausibly has several diverse introduction histories. Based on our current understanding, the establishment of Pomacea spp., is alarming and widespread beyond geopolitical borders, requiring a concerted and expedited national and international invasive species mitigation program.\nCzech Republic butterfly barcoding reveals that distribution of genetic lineages depends on species traits\nAuthors: Suchackova Bartonova, A.; Skopek, P.; Konvicka, M.; Benes, J.; Spitzer, L.; Sbaraglia, C.; Vrabec, V.; Papp Maresova, J.; Konvickova, H.; Faltynek Fric, Z.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576072\nAimThe distribution of within-species lineages has been affected by Quaternary climate changes, and population differentiation has been influenced by species life histories. We investigated whether the distribution of individual mitochondrial genetic lineages reflects the constituent species traits. Using the functionally diverse group of butterflies, we examined which lineages are present in Central Europe, an important suture zone. LocationEurope TaxonA total of 140 butterfly species. MethodsWe sequenced barcodes (cytochrome c oxidase 1) of the entire Czech Republic butterfly fauna ([~] 1000 sequences) and used database data to visualize the species biogeographic patterns across Europe. We categorised the distribution patterns of lineages inhabiting the Czech Republic, and used multivariate statistics to interpret these categories by the butterflies habitats, life histories, and threat levels. ResultsOpen habitat dwellers with specialist traits belonged to Eastern, Southern, and temperate lineages. Habitat generalists and woodland dwellers belonged to the Western lineage, formed several lineages, or displayed low genetic diversity; they often developed on woody plants, were large-winged, and had long flight periods. The most threatened species were the specialists of Southern, Eastern, and temperate lineages. Main conclusionsThe distribution of lineages in Central Europe reflects the history of Quaternary ecosystems: during cold periods of the Pleistocene, the diverse open habitats prevailed, and species could expand westwards. Such species also suffer the most under the current anthropogenic habitat alteration. On the other hand, the mobile generalists and woodland dwellers expanded to Central Europe during the Holocene. Our approach of linking the distribution of lineages with species traits can be transferred to other study systems, and we show that barcoding of under-sampled areas represents a powerful tool for discovering the driving forces of biogeography.\neDITH: an R-package to spatially project eDNA-based biodiversity across river networks with minimal prior information\nAuthors: Carraro, L.; Altermatt, F.\nScore: 32.3, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575835\nO_LIEcological and ecosystem monitoring is rapidly shifting towards using environmental DNA (eDNA) data, particularly in aquatic systems. This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed. C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.

        <p class="abstract">Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Under an adaptive hypothesis, the reciprocal influence between mutualistic plants and frugivores is expected to result in dispersal syndromes comprising both frugivore and plant traits that structure fruit consumption. Tests of this adaptive hypothesis, however, focus on traits of either fruits or frugivores but not both and often ignore within-species variation. To overcome these limitations, we analyze traits for the mutualistic ecological network comprising Carollia bats that feed on and disperse Piper seeds. For these analyses, we use generalized joint attribute modeling (GJAM), a Bayesian modeling approach that simultaneously accounts for multiple sources of variance across trait types. In support of the adaptive hypothesis and indicating niche partitioning among Carollia bats, we find differential consumption of a suite of Piper species influenced by bat traits such as body size; however, Piper morphological traits had no effect on bat consumption. Slow evolutionary rates, dispersal by other vertebrates, and unexamined fruit traits, such as Piper chemical bouquets, may explain the lack of association between bat Piper consumption and fruit morphological traits. We have identified a potential asymmetric influence of frugivore traits on plant-frugivore interactions, providing a template for future trait analyses of plant-animal networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at de novo discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the EQO approach of Shan et al. [25]). This success seems puzzling, since modeling community function as a linear combination of contributions of individual species appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the &#34;correct&#34; grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones.

Author summaryNatural microbial communities are highly complex, making predictive modeling difficult. One appealing approach is to make their description less detailed, rendering modeling more tractable while hopefully still retaining some predictive power. The Tree of Life naturally provides one possible method for building coarser descriptions (instead of thousands of strains, we could think about hundreds of species; or dozens of families). However, it is known that useful descriptions need not be taxonomically coherent, as illustrated, for example, by the so-called functional guilds. This prompted the development of computational methods seeking to propose candidate groupings in a data-driven manner. In this computational study, we examine one class of such methods, recently proposed in the microbial context. Quantitatively testing their performance can be difficult, as the answer they &#34;should&#34; recover is often unknown. Here, we overcome this difficulty by testing these methods on synthetic data from a model where the ground truth is known by construction. Curiously, we demonstrate that simpler approaches, rather than suffering from this simplicity, can in fact be more robust.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote d&#39;Ivoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Species future distributions are commonly predicted using models that link the likelihood of occurrence of individuals to the environment. Although animals movements are influenced by physical landscapes and individual experiences (for example space familiarity), species distribution models developed from observations of unknown individuals cannot integrate these latter variables, turning them into  invisible landscapes. In this theoretical study, we address how overlooking  invisible landscapes impacts the estimation of habitat selection and thereby the projection of future distributions. Overlooking the attraction towards some  invisible variable consistently led to over-estimating the strength of habitat selection. Consequently, projections of future population distributions were also biased, with animals tracking habitat changes less than predicted. Our results reveal an overlooked challenge faced by correlative species distribution models based on the observation of unknown individuals, whose past experience of the environment is by definition not known. Mechanistic distribution modelling integrating cognitive processes underlying movement should be developed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Land-based mitigation strategies (LBMS) are critical to reducing climate change and will require large areas for their implementation. Yet few studies have considered how and where LBMS compete for land or are mutually compatible across Earths surface. We derived high resolution estimates of the spatial distribution of 19 different LBMS. We estimated 8.9 billion ha suitable for LBMS across the Earth, including 5.6 Bha suitable for only one of the studied strategies and 3.3 Bha suitable for multiple LBMS. We identified significant conflicts between better carbon management of existing land cover types, and restoration-based strategies such as reforestation. At the same time, several agricultural management LBMS were compatible over large areas, including for example, enhanced weathering and improved plantation rotations. Our analysis presents local stakeholders, communities, and governments with the range of LBMS options, and the opportunity costs associated with scaling up any given LBMS to reduce global climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Characterizing the sand fly diversity is crucial for an effective design of control strategies for Leishmaniasis. We aimed to characterize the sand fly biodiversity around the Tona Reservoir (Santander, Colombia) and to compare the performance of four sampling methods. A sampling of insects was performed in 2017 in the most preserved and least preserved areas close to the Tona Reservoir, using Torre Vigia-UIS and HomeTrap-UIS, two sticky traps previously designed by our working group, CDC, and Bg-Sentinel traps. We collected 268 Phlebotominae specimens, most with CDC (47.8%) and Torre Vigia-UIS (30.2%) traps. Some specimens (47%) could not be determined because of their preservation status; these samples came mostly from the sticky traps. We found 16 sand fly morphospecies, of which 12 were determined to species level. Here, we report two new records for Santander: Pintomyia youngi (Feliciangeli and Murillo, 1987) and Lutzomyia ceferinoi (Ortiz and Alvarez, 1963). We also collected some confirmed vectors of Leishmania: Pi. youngi, Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu, 1931), and Lu. longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912). The highest diversity was collected in the most disturbed area (15 spp.), and in the rainy season (April, 12 spp.). Pintomyia youngi distribution was broad through the Tona Reservoir in all the sampled periods, and we suggest tracking it to infer leishmaniasis risk in the Tona Reservoir. Torre Vigia-UIS seems a valuable tool for vector control, but we do not recommend it for biodiversity studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cryptic invasion of golden apple snails (Pomacea spp.) in Taiwan has caused significant ecological and economical damage, however, their management remains difficult due to inadequate taxonomic identification, complex phylogeny and limited population genetic information. We aim to understand the current distribution, putative population of origin, genetic diversity and potential path of invasion of Pomacea spp. across Taiwan to aid in improved mitigation approaches. The present investigation conducted a nationwide survey with 254 samples collected from 41 locations from 14 counties or cities across Taiwan. We identified and compared the genetic diversity of P. canaliculata and P. maculata based on mitochondrial COI in Taiwan, as well as other introduced and native countries (publicly available COI data) to understand the possible paths of invasion in Taiwan. Based on mitochondrial COI barcoding, sympatric but heterogeneous distributions of invasive P. canaliculata (widespread) and P. maculata (mostly restricted to Southern Taiwan) were noted. Our haplotype analysis and mismatch distribution suggest multiple introductions of P. canaliculata likely originated directly from Argentina, whereas P. maculata was probably introduced from a single, or a few, introduction event(s) from Argentina and Brazil, instead of directly from Brazil. Our population genetic data further demonstrated higher haplotype and genetic diversity for P. canaliculata and P. maculata in Taiwan compared to other Asian countries, which also suggest multiple introductions affected Taiwan. Comparing the introduction history, current distribution and cryptic nature of P. canaliculata and P. maculata in Taiwan, we posit that P. maculata was likely introduced along with P. canaliculata (either intentionally or unintentionally), whereas, P. canaliculata plausibly has several diverse introduction histories. Based on our current understanding, the establishment of Pomacea spp., is alarming and widespread beyond geopolitical borders, requiring a concerted and expedited national and international invasive species mitigation program.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimThe distribution of within-species lineages has been affected by Quaternary climate changes, and population differentiation has been influenced by species life histories. We investigated whether the distribution of individual mitochondrial genetic lineages reflects the constituent species traits. Using the functionally diverse group of butterflies, we examined which lineages are present in Central Europe, an important suture zone.

LocationEurope

TaxonA total of 140 butterfly species.

MethodsWe sequenced barcodes (cytochrome c oxidase 1) of the entire Czech Republic butterfly fauna ([~] 1000 sequences) and used database data to visualize the species biogeographic patterns across Europe. We categorised the distribution patterns of lineages inhabiting the Czech Republic, and used multivariate statistics to interpret these categories by the butterflies habitats, life histories, and threat levels.

ResultsOpen habitat dwellers with specialist traits belonged to Eastern, Southern, and temperate lineages. Habitat generalists and woodland dwellers belonged to the Western lineage, formed several lineages, or displayed low genetic diversity; they often developed on woody plants, were large-winged, and had long flight periods. The most threatened species were the specialists of Southern, Eastern, and temperate lineages.

Main conclusionsThe distribution of lineages in Central Europe reflects the history of Quaternary ecosystems: during cold periods of the Pleistocene, the diverse open habitats prevailed, and species could expand westwards. Such species also suffer the most under the current anthropogenic habitat alteration. On the other hand, the mobile generalists and woodland dwellers expanded to Central Europe during the Holocene. Our approach of linking the distribution of lineages with species traits can be transferred to other study systems, and we show that barcoding of under-sampled areas represents a powerful tool for discovering the driving forces of biogeography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIEcological and ecosystem monitoring is rapidly shifting towards using environmental DNA (eDNA) data, particularly in aquatic systems. This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed.
C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.
