However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.\nSounds of the underground reflect soil biodiversity dynamics across a grassy woodland restoration chronosequence\nAuthors: Robinson, J. M.; Taylor, A.; Fickling, N.; Sun, X.; Breed, M. F.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577311\nFifty-nine percent of species on Earth inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our most diverse ecosystems.\nLinear-regression-based algorithms can succeed at identifying microbial functional groups despite the nonlinearity of ecological function\nAuthors: Zhao, Y.; Cordero, O. X.; Tikhonov, M.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576558\nMicrobial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at de novo discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the EQO approach of Shan et al. [25]). This success seems puzzling, since modeling community function as a linear combination of contributions of individual species appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the \"correct\" grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones. Author summaryNatural microbial communities are highly complex, making predictive modeling difficult. One appealing approach is to make their description less detailed, rendering modeling more tractable while hopefully still retaining some predictive power. The Tree of Life naturally provides one possible method for building coarser descriptions (instead of thousands of strains, we could think about hundreds of species; or dozens of families). However, it is known that useful descriptions need not be taxonomically coherent, as illustrated, for example, by the so-called functional guilds. This prompted the development of computational methods seeking to propose candidate groupings in a data-driven manner. In this computational study, we examine one class of such methods, recently proposed in the microbial context. Quantitatively testing their performance can be difficult, as the answer they \"should\" recover is often unknown. Here, we overcome this difficulty by testing these methods on synthetic data from a model where the ground truth is known by construction. Curiously, we demonstrate that simpler approaches, rather than suffering from this simplicity, can in fact be more robust.\nPhysiological and behavioural resistance of malaria vectors in rural West-Africa : a data mining study to address their fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity, drivers, and predictability\nAuthors: Taconet, P.; SOMA, D. D.; Zogo, B.; Mouline, K.; Simard, F.; Koffi, A. A.; Dabire, R. K.; Pennetier, C.; Moiroux, N.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.20.504631\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.\nDNA metabarcoding-based detection of non-indigenous invertebrates in recreational marinas: influence of sample type and seasonal variation\nAuthors: Lavrador, A. S.; Amaral, F. G.; Moutinho, J.; Vieira, P. E.; Costa, F. O.; Duarte, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577180\nMonitoring of marine invertebrate non-indigenous species (NIS) using DNA metabarcoding can be strongly affected by selected sample type due to life history traits, such as habitat preferences and life cycles. Two marinas in the north of Portugal were sampled to assess the impact of sample type (hard and artificial substrates, water eDNA, and zooplankton) and season (spring, autumn, winter) on species and NIS recovery. Using two molecular markers - the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S) - a total of 636 species and 31 NIS were detected. Species numbers were slightly higher in the marina more exposed to maritime traffic, and the highest percentage of exclusive species was detected in zooplankton (up to 24%), as well as the highest numbers of NIS. Regarding season, the highest numbers of species and NIS were detected in the spring and autumn (varying within each marina). Taxonomic composition analysis revealed differences in species richness and community structure among seasons and sample types, particularly between hard and artificial substrates versus eDNA and zooplankton. Of the 31 NIS detected, six are potential first records for Portugal, which await morphology-based validation. No NIS were detected in all sample types nor in all sampled seasons. This highlights the need to employ different sampling approaches and markers, as well as consider seasonal variation and level of exposure to maritime-driven introductions to guarantee a comprehensive metabarcoding-based surveillance of NIS in recreational marinas.\nCan overlooking \"invisible landscapes\" bias habitat selection estimation and population distribution projections?\nAuthors: Dejeante, R.; Lemaire-Patin, R.; Chamaille-Jammes, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576416\nSpecies future distributions are commonly predicted using models that link the likelihood of occurrence of individuals to the environment. Although animals movements are influenced by physical landscapes and individual experiences (for example space familiarity), species distribution models developed from observations of unknown individuals cannot integrate these latter variables, turning them into invisible landscapes. In this theoretical study, we address how overlooking invisible landscapes impacts the estimation of habitat selection and thereby the projection of future distributions. Overlooking the attraction towards some invisible variable consistently led to over-estimating the strength of habitat selection. Consequently, projections of future population distributions were also biased, with animals tracking habitat changes less than predicted. Our results reveal an overlooked challenge faced by correlative species distribution models based on the observation of unknown individuals, whose past experience of the environment is by definition not known. Mechanistic distribution modelling integrating cognitive processes underlying movement should be developed.\nDynamic coexistence driven by physiological transitions in microbial communities\nAuthors: Narla, A.; Hwa, T.; Murugan, A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575059\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMicrobial ecosystems are commonly modeled by fixed interactions between species in steady exponential growth states. However, microbes often modify their environments so strongly that they are forced out of the exponential state into stressed or non-growing states. Such dynamics are typical of ecological succession in nature and serial-dilution cycles in the laboratory. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model, the Community State model, to gain insight into the dynamic coexistence of microbes due to changes in their physiological states. Our model bypasses specific interactions (e.g., nutrient starvation, stress, aggregation) that lead to different combinations of physiological states, referred to collectively as \"community states\", and modeled by specifying the growth preference of each species along a global ecological coordinate, taken here to be the total community biomass density. We identify three key features of such dynamical communities that contrast starkly with steady-state communities: increased tolerance of community diversity to fast growth rates of species dominating different community states, enhanced community stability through staggered dominance of different species in different community states, and increased requirement on growth dominance for the inclusion of late-growing species. These features, derived explicitly for simplified models, are proposed here to be principles aiding the understanding of complex dynamical communities. Our model shifts the focus of ecosystem dynamics from bottom-up studies based on idealized inter-species interaction to top-down studies based on accessible macroscopic observables such as growth rates and total biomass density, enabling quantitative examination of community-wide characteristics.\nGlobal spatial potential for implementing land-based climate mitigation\nAuthors: Beaury, E. M.; Smith, J.; Levine, J.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574063\nLand-based mitigation strategies (LBMS) are critical to reducing climate change and will require large areas for their implementation. Yet few studies have considered how and where LBMS compete for land or are mutually compatible across Earths surface. We derived high resolution estimates of the spatial distribution of 19 different LBMS. We estimated 8.9 billion ha suitable for LBMS across the Earth, including 5.6 Bha suitable for only one of the studied strategies and 3.3 Bha suitable for multiple LBMS. We identified significant conflicts between better carbon management of existing land cover types, and restoration-based strategies such as reforestation. At the same time, several agricultural management LBMS were compatible over large areas, including for example, enhanced weathering and improved plantation rotations. Our analysis presents local stakeholders, communities, and governments with the range of LBMS options, and the opportunity costs associated with scaling up any given LBMS to reduce global climate change.\nDensity dependence shapes life-history trade-offs in a food limited ungulate population\nAuthors: Jaggi, H.; ZUO, W.; Kentie, R.; Gaillard, J.-M.; Coulson, T.; Tuljapurkar, S. D.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577325\nQuantifying trade-offs within populations is an important goal in life-history and evolutionary theory. However, most studies focusing on life-history variation assume trade-offs to be static. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding life-history variation at different densities while enabling us to reveal trade-offs that are often masked due to individual heterogeneity. We use published individual-based data from a population of Soay sheep and find density dependence strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and the distribution of lifetime reproductive success. We find trade-offs between juvenile survival and growth structure life-history variation for Soay sheep at all densities, but the intensity of the trade-offs increases with population density. At carrying capacity (K), a new trade-off appears between reproduction and juvenile survival. In addition, we find the distribution of LRS to be highly constrained at K, with mothers of prime adult sizes (~ 25kg) contributing the most to reproduction. We also find the effects of density-dependence on demographic measures such as net reproductive rate, stable size distribution, and average vital rate functions. Our results suggest high density limits the diversity of individual life history strategies and has implications for better understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics via density-dependent selection and management of ungulates in food limited environments.\neDITH: an R-package to spatially project eDNA-based biodiversity across river networks with minimal prior information\nAuthors: Carraro, L.; Altermatt, F.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575835\nO_LIEcological and ecosystem monitoring is rapidly shifting towards using environmental DNA (eDNA) data, particularly in aquatic systems. This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed. C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.

        <p class="abstract">Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fifty-nine percent of species on Earth inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our most diverse ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at de novo discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the EQO approach of Shan et al. [25]). This success seems puzzling, since modeling community function as a linear combination of contributions of individual species appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the &#34;correct&#34; grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones.

Author summaryNatural microbial communities are highly complex, making predictive modeling difficult. One appealing approach is to make their description less detailed, rendering modeling more tractable while hopefully still retaining some predictive power. The Tree of Life naturally provides one possible method for building coarser descriptions (instead of thousands of strains, we could think about hundreds of species; or dozens of families). However, it is known that useful descriptions need not be taxonomically coherent, as illustrated, for example, by the so-called functional guilds. This prompted the development of computational methods seeking to propose candidate groupings in a data-driven manner. In this computational study, we examine one class of such methods, recently proposed in the microbial context. Quantitatively testing their performance can be difficult, as the answer they &#34;should&#34; recover is often unknown. Here, we overcome this difficulty by testing these methods on synthetic data from a model where the ground truth is known by construction. Curiously, we demonstrate that simpler approaches, rather than suffering from this simplicity, can in fact be more robust.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring of marine invertebrate non-indigenous species (NIS) using DNA metabarcoding can be strongly affected by selected sample type due to life history traits, such as habitat preferences and life cycles. Two marinas in the north of Portugal were sampled to assess the impact of sample type (hard and artificial substrates, water eDNA, and zooplankton) and season (spring, autumn, winter) on species and NIS recovery. Using two molecular markers - the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S) - a total of 636 species and 31 NIS were detected. Species numbers were slightly higher in the marina more exposed to maritime traffic, and the highest percentage of exclusive species was detected in zooplankton (up to 24%), as well as the highest numbers of NIS. Regarding season, the highest numbers of species and NIS were detected in the spring and autumn (varying within each marina). Taxonomic composition analysis revealed differences in species richness and community structure among seasons and sample types, particularly between hard and artificial substrates versus eDNA and zooplankton. Of the 31 NIS detected, six are potential first records for Portugal, which await morphology-based validation. No NIS were detected in all sample types nor in all sampled seasons. This highlights the need to employ different sampling approaches and markers, as well as consider seasonal variation and level of exposure to maritime-driven introductions to guarantee a comprehensive metabarcoding-based surveillance of NIS in recreational marinas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Species future distributions are commonly predicted using models that link the likelihood of occurrence of individuals to the environment. Although animals movements are influenced by physical landscapes and individual experiences (for example space familiarity), species distribution models developed from observations of unknown individuals cannot integrate these latter variables, turning them into  invisible landscapes. In this theoretical study, we address how overlooking  invisible landscapes impacts the estimation of habitat selection and thereby the projection of future distributions. Overlooking the attraction towards some  invisible variable consistently led to over-estimating the strength of habitat selection. Consequently, projections of future population distributions were also biased, with animals tracking habitat changes less than predicted. Our results reveal an overlooked challenge faced by correlative species distribution models based on the observation of unknown individuals, whose past experience of the environment is by definition not known. Mechanistic distribution modelling integrating cognitive processes underlying movement should be developed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMicrobial ecosystems are commonly modeled by fixed interactions between species in steady exponential growth states. However, microbes often modify their environments so strongly that they are forced out of the exponential state into stressed or non-growing states. Such dynamics are typical of ecological succession in nature and serial-dilution cycles in the laboratory. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model, the Community State model, to gain insight into the dynamic coexistence of microbes due to changes in their physiological states. Our model bypasses specific interactions (e.g., nutrient starvation, stress, aggregation) that lead to different combinations of physiological states, referred to collectively as &#34;community states&#34;, and modeled by specifying the growth preference of each species along a global ecological coordinate, taken here to be the total community biomass density. We identify three key features of such dynamical communities that contrast starkly with steady-state communities: increased tolerance of community diversity to fast growth rates of species dominating different community states, enhanced community stability through staggered dominance of different species in different community states, and increased requirement on growth dominance for the inclusion of late-growing species. These features, derived explicitly for simplified models, are proposed here to be principles aiding the understanding of complex dynamical communities. Our model shifts the focus of ecosystem dynamics from bottom-up studies based on idealized inter-species interaction to top-down studies based on accessible macroscopic observables such as growth rates and total biomass density, enabling quantitative examination of community-wide characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Land-based mitigation strategies (LBMS) are critical to reducing climate change and will require large areas for their implementation. Yet few studies have considered how and where LBMS compete for land or are mutually compatible across Earths surface. We derived high resolution estimates of the spatial distribution of 19 different LBMS. We estimated 8.9 billion ha suitable for LBMS across the Earth, including 5.6 Bha suitable for only one of the studied strategies and 3.3 Bha suitable for multiple LBMS. We identified significant conflicts between better carbon management of existing land cover types, and restoration-based strategies such as reforestation. At the same time, several agricultural management LBMS were compatible over large areas, including for example, enhanced weathering and improved plantation rotations. Our analysis presents local stakeholders, communities, and governments with the range of LBMS options, and the opportunity costs associated with scaling up any given LBMS to reduce global climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Quantifying trade-offs within populations is an important goal in life-history and evolutionary theory. However, most studies focusing on life-history variation assume trade-offs to be static. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding life-history variation at different densities while enabling us to reveal trade-offs that are often masked due to individual heterogeneity. We use published individual-based data from a population of Soay sheep and find density dependence strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and the distribution of lifetime reproductive success. We find trade-offs between juvenile survival and growth structure life-history variation for Soay sheep at all densities, but the intensity of the trade-offs increases with population density. At carrying capacity (K), a new trade-off appears between reproduction and juvenile survival. In addition, we find the distribution of LRS to be highly constrained at K, with mothers of prime adult sizes (~ 25kg) contributing the most to reproduction. We also find the effects of density-dependence on demographic measures such as net reproductive rate, stable size distribution, and average vital rate functions. Our results suggest high density limits the diversity of individual life history strategies and has implications for better understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics via density-dependent selection and management of ungulates in food limited environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIEcological and ecosystem monitoring is rapidly shifting towards using environmental DNA (eDNA) data, particularly in aquatic systems. This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed.
C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.
