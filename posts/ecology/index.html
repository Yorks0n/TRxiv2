J.; Field, C.; Mills Flemming, J.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574363\nStep selection analysis is used to jointly describe animal movement patterns and habitat preferences. Recent work has extended this framework to model inter-individual differences, account for unexplained structure in animals space use, and capture temporally-varying patterns of movement and habitat selection. In this paper, we formulate step selection functions with penalised smooths (similar to generalised additive models) to unify new and existing extensions, and conveniently implement the models in the popular, open-source mgcv R package. We explore non-linear patterns of movement and habitat selection, and use the equivalence between penalised smoothing splines and random effects to implement individual-level and spatial random effects. This framework can also be used to fit varying-coefficient models to account for temporally or spatially-heterogeneous patterns of selection (e.g., resulting from behavioural variation), or any other non-linear interactions between drivers of the animals movement decisions. We provide the necessary technical details to understand several key special cases of smooths and their implementation in mgcv, showcase the ecological relevance using two illustrative examples, and provide extensive R code (available at https://github.com/NJKlappstein/smoothSSF) to facilitate the adoption of these methods. This paper is a broad overview of how smooth effects can be applied to increase the flexibility and biological realism of step selection analysis.\nTaking identity-by-descent analysis into the wild: Estimating realized relatedness in free-ranging macaques\nAuthors: Freudiger, A.; Jovanovic, V.

L.; Ruiz-Lambides, A.; Tung, J.; Nowick, K.; Ringbauer, H.; Widdig, A.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574911\nBiological relatedness is a key consideration in studies of behavior, population structure, and trait evolution. Except for parent-offspring dyads, pedigrees capture relatedness imperfectly. The number and length of DNA segments that are identical-by-descent (IBD) yield the most precise estimates of relatedness. Here, we leverage novel methods for estimating locus-specific IBD from low coverage whole genome resequencing data to demonstrate the feasibility and value of resolving fine-scaled gradients of relatedness in free-living animals. Using primarily 4-6x coverage data from a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with available long-term pedigree data, we show that we can call the number and length of IBD segments across the genome with high accuracy even at 0.5x coverage. The resulting estimates demonstrate substantial variation in genetic relatedness within kin classes, leading to overlapping distributions between kin classes. They identify cryptic genetic relatives that are not represented in the pedigree and reveal elevated recombination rates in females relative to males, which allows us to discriminate maternal and paternal kin using genotype data alone. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the ability to understand the predictors and consequences of genetic relatedness in natural populations, contributing to our understanding of a fundamental component of population structure in the wild.\nEvaluating key evidence and formulating regulatory alternatives regarding the UK Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill\nAuthors: Challender, D.; 't Sas-Rolfes, M.; Dickman, A.; Hare, D.; Hart, A.; Hoffmann, M.; Mallon, D.; Mandisodza-Chikerema, R.; Roe, D.\nScore: 125.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544826\nPublic policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as \"trophy hunting\" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.\nClimate change, age acceleration, and the erosion of fitness in polar bears\nAuthors: Newediuk, L.; Richardson, E. S.; Biddlecombe, B. A.; Kassim, H.; Kathan, L.; Lunn, N.; Rivkin, L. R.; Salama, O. E.; Schmidt, C.; Jones, M. J.; Garroway, C. J.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574416\nRapid climate change is expected to impose strong selective pressures on wild populations, disrupting evolved life history strategies and limiting population viability1. The magnitude and pace at which environments will change means the persistence of wild populations will depend substantially on their ability to adapt genetically. However, we know very little about the capacity for evolutionary change in response to the rapid pace and predicted magnitude of warming. The Arctic is the fastest warming region on the planet2, so that is where we can first address this knowledge gap. Using estimates of epigenetic age acceleration, which indicate the accumulation of stress exposures across lifetimes3,4, we found polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay, Canada aged one year faster on average for each degree Celsius of temperature rise they experienced. As predicted by established theory, age acceleration was associated with reproducing early, a trait that prior to the onset of rapid warming, increased lifetime reproductive success for bears. However, the fitness benefit of early reproduction eroded with increased warming, reflecting a redirection of energy away from reproduction toward maintenance. Finally, we found no evidence for recent selection on traits associated with lifetime reproductive success. It appears that the fitness costs of increased lifetime stressful exposures associated with warming leaves little scope for genetic adaptation in this population. These findings, together with global forecasts of abrupt exposure of species to intolerable temperature extremes5, warn that adaptive responses to warming could be the exception rather than the rule.\nComparative analysis of the plasma metabolome of migrating passerines during stopover: Novel insights into flight metabolism\nAuthors: Domer, A.; Jasinska, W.; Rosental, L.; Shochat, E.; Fernie, A. R.; Alseekh, S.; Brotman, Y.; Ovadia, O.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574878\nDuring long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.\nExploratory and risk-taking behaviours in coexisting rodents\nAuthors: Hughes, B.; Bowman, J.; Schulte-Hostedde, A.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574853\nThere has been an increasing interest in modelling the influence of animal personality on species interactions within ecosystems. Animal personality traits associated with dispersal, movement within a home range and risk-taking, including docility and exploration, have been shown to influence an array of environmental variables including seed dispersal and habitat availability. Despite growing interest however, little information is available to model the effects of differences in personality phenotypes among coexisting species. Since coexisting or sympatric species often compete for resources, differences in movement patterns can help mitigate the impact of intra- and interspecific competition. We used two standardized behavioural tests with three species of coexisting rodents in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada to measure exploration and docility personality phenotypes. To evaluate personalities, we modelled plastic changes in behaviours within species and phenotypic variation in behavioural strategies among species. We show empirical evidence to support differences in personality phenotypes in coexisting species and consider the importance of alternative personality strategies in shaping community dynamics.\nExperimental evaluation of Eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) detectability in visual search surveys\nAuthors: Heinle, W. F.; Beswick, N.; Wapman, E.; Royle, J.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.572695\nUnderstanding how detection probability varies over time, space, or in response to measurable covariates is important to inform the monitoring and assessment of many species. A standard model to understand detectability - the availability/perception model - admits that detection probability is the composite of two components: availability and perception. Availability is largely affected by environmental and behavioral factors, whereas perception is primarily affected by attributes of individual observers and survey protocols, and thus can potentially be partially controlled by survey design. We designed and implemented a field study to understand the perception component of detection for Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) using visual encounter surveys. We obtained and deployed museum specimens of Eastern box turtle shells and subjected them to visual search surveys by observers in realistic field situations. Overall, about 50% of the box turtle shells were detected by observers including, 41.5% in the partially visible state and 63% in the fully visible state. There were significant differences among observers, which may be due to observer-specific variation in search technique -- the observers varied in how well they achieved the protocol guidance.\nImpacts of increasing isolation and environmental variation on Florida Scrub-Jay demography\nAuthors: Summers, J.; Cosgrove, E.; Bowman, R.; Fitzpatrick, J. W.; Chen, N.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575127\nIsolation caused by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation can destabilize populations. Population demography is shaped by complex interactions among local vital rates, environmental fluctuations, and changing immigration rates. Empirical studies of these interactions are critical for testing theoretical expectations of how populations respond to isolation. We used a 34-year demographic and environmental dataset from a population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) that has experienced declining immigration to create mechanistic models linking environmental factors and variation in vital rates to population growth rates over time. We found that the population has remained stable despite declining immigration and increasing inbreeding, owing to a coinciding increase in breeder survival. We find evidence of density-dependent responses of immigration, breeder survival, and fecundity, indicating that interactions between vital rates and local density likely play a role in buffering the population against change. Our study elucidates the interactions between environment and demography that underlie population stability.\nHierarchical Ordination, A unifying framework for drivers of community processes\nAuthors: O'Hara, R. B.; van der Veen, B.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574701\nOrdination methods have been used by community ecologists to describe and explore the communities they sample by reducing this variation down to a small number of dimensions. More recently, Joint Species Distribution Models have been developed to model and predict the distributions of several species simultaneously. Contemporary models for the data for both of these problems are essentially the same, called Generalised Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVMs). Based on this we suggest some avenues of cross-fertilisation between the two areas of research. We also describe some of the extensions to GLLVMs, and from this suggest the development of Hierarchical Ordination, as a way of efficiently modelling communities of species in space.\nComplex life cycles and parasite-mediated trophic cascades drive species coexistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity\nAuthors: Hijar-Islas, A. C.; Mon Pere, N. V.; Huang, W.; Eizaguirre, C.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.571902\nEcological and evolutionary processes shape the dynamics of interacting species, yet the drivers of eco-evolutionary feedback remain elusive. Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Step selection analysis is used to jointly describe animal movement patterns and habitat preferences. Recent work has extended this framework to model inter-individual differences, account for unexplained structure in animals space use, and capture temporally-varying patterns of movement and habitat selection. In this paper, we formulate step selection functions with penalised smooths (similar to generalised additive models) to unify new and existing extensions, and conveniently implement the models in the popular, open-source mgcv R package. We explore non-linear patterns of movement and habitat selection, and use the equivalence between penalised smoothing splines and random effects to implement individual-level and spatial random effects. This framework can also be used to fit varying-coefficient models to account for temporally or spatially-heterogeneous patterns of selection (e.g., resulting from behavioural variation), or any other non-linear interactions between drivers of the animals movement decisions. We provide the necessary technical details to understand several key special cases of smooths and their implementation in mgcv, showcase the ecological relevance using two illustrative examples, and provide extensive R code (available at https://github.com/NJKlappstein/smoothSSF) to facilitate the adoption of these methods. This paper is a broad overview of how smooth effects can be applied to increase the flexibility and biological realism of step selection analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological relatedness is a key consideration in studies of behavior, population structure, and trait evolution. Except for parent-offspring dyads, pedigrees capture relatedness imperfectly. The number and length of DNA segments that are identical-by-descent (IBD) yield the most precise estimates of relatedness. Here, we leverage novel methods for estimating locus-specific IBD from low coverage whole genome resequencing data to demonstrate the feasibility and value of resolving fine-scaled gradients of relatedness in free-living animals. Using primarily 4-6x coverage data from a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with available long-term pedigree data, we show that we can call the number and length of IBD segments across the genome with high accuracy even at 0.5x coverage. The resulting estimates demonstrate substantial variation in genetic relatedness within kin classes, leading to overlapping distributions between kin classes. They identify cryptic genetic relatives that are not represented in the pedigree and reveal elevated recombination rates in females relative to males, which allows us to discriminate maternal and paternal kin using genotype data alone. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the ability to understand the predictors and consequences of genetic relatedness in natural populations, contributing to our understanding of a fundamental component of population structure in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Public policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as &#34;trophy hunting&#34; is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {&#43;/-} 66.53 (mean {&#43;/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {&#43;/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rapid climate change is expected to impose strong selective pressures on wild populations, disrupting evolved life history strategies and limiting population viability1. The magnitude and pace at which environments will change means the persistence of wild populations will depend substantially on their ability to adapt genetically. However, we know very little about the capacity for evolutionary change in response to the rapid pace and predicted magnitude of warming. The Arctic is the fastest warming region on the planet2, so that is where we can first address this knowledge gap. Using estimates of epigenetic age acceleration, which indicate the accumulation of stress exposures across lifetimes3,4, we found polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay, Canada aged one year faster on average for each degree Celsius of temperature rise they experienced. As predicted by established theory, age acceleration was associated with reproducing early, a trait that prior to the onset of rapid warming, increased lifetime reproductive success for bears. However, the fitness benefit of early reproduction eroded with increased warming, reflecting a redirection of energy away from reproduction toward maintenance. Finally, we found no evidence for recent selection on traits associated with lifetime reproductive success. It appears that the fitness costs of increased lifetime stressful exposures associated with warming leaves little scope for genetic adaptation in this population. These findings, together with global forecasts of abrupt exposure of species to intolerable temperature extremes5, warn that adaptive responses to warming could be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There has been an increasing interest in modelling the influence of animal personality on species interactions within ecosystems. Animal personality traits associated with dispersal, movement within a home range and risk-taking, including docility and exploration, have been shown to influence an array of environmental variables including seed dispersal and habitat availability. Despite growing interest however, little information is available to model the effects of differences in personality phenotypes among coexisting species. Since coexisting or sympatric species often compete for resources, differences in movement patterns can help mitigate the impact of intra- and interspecific competition. We used two standardized behavioural tests with three species of coexisting rodents in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada to measure exploration and docility personality phenotypes. To evaluate personalities, we modelled plastic changes in behaviours within species and phenotypic variation in behavioural strategies among species. We show empirical evidence to support differences in personality phenotypes in coexisting species and consider the importance of alternative personality strategies in shaping community dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how detection probability varies over time, space, or in response to measurable covariates is important to inform the monitoring and assessment of many species. A standard model to understand detectability - the availability/perception model - admits that detection probability is the composite of two components: availability and perception. Availability is largely affected by environmental and behavioral factors, whereas perception is primarily affected by attributes of individual observers and survey protocols, and thus can potentially be partially controlled by survey design. We designed and implemented a field study to understand the perception component of detection for Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) using visual encounter surveys. We obtained and deployed museum specimens of Eastern box turtle shells and subjected them to visual search surveys by observers in realistic field situations. Overall, about 50% of the box turtle shells were detected by observers including, 41.5% in the  partially visible state and 63% in the  fully visible state. There were significant differences among observers, which may be due to observer-specific variation in search technique -- the observers varied in how well they achieved the protocol guidance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Isolation caused by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation can destabilize populations. Population demography is shaped by complex interactions among local vital rates, environmental fluctuations, and changing immigration rates. Empirical studies of these interactions are critical for testing theoretical expectations of how populations respond to isolation. We used a 34-year demographic and environmental dataset from a population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) that has experienced declining immigration to create mechanistic models linking environmental factors and variation in vital rates to population growth rates over time. We found that the population has remained stable despite declining immigration and increasing inbreeding, owing to a coinciding increase in breeder survival. We find evidence of density-dependent responses of immigration, breeder survival, and fecundity, indicating that interactions between vital rates and local density likely play a role in buffering the population against change. Our study elucidates the interactions between environment and demography that underlie population stability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ordination methods have been used by community ecologists to describe and explore the communities they sample by reducing this variation down to a small number of dimensions. More recently, Joint Species Distribution Models have been developed to model and predict the distributions of several species simultaneously. Contemporary models for the data for both of these problems are essentially the same, called Generalised Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVMs). Based on this we suggest some avenues of cross-fertilisation between the two areas of research. We also describe some of the extensions to GLLVMs, and from this suggest the development of Hierarchical Ordination, as a way of efficiently modelling communities of species in space.</p>

Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.</p>
