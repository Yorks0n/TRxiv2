These gaps are particularly wide in mountain regions where healthy soils are especially important for human safety and yet evidence is accumulating of ongoing degradation, posing significant threats to ecosystem functioning and human settlements. To analyse these gaps in detail, we synthesise current research on the global diversity of microorganisms, cryptogams, and invertebrates in mountain soils above the treeline. This synthesis is based on a semi-quantitative survey of the literature and an expert-based analysis. Our work reveals not only deficiencies in geographic cover but also significant gaps in taxonomic coverage, particularly among soil protists and invertebrates, and a lack of (functional and ecological) description of the uncultivated majority of prokaryotes, fungi, and protists. We subsequently build on this overview to highlight opportunities for research on mountain soils as systems of co-occurring species that interact in complex environmental matrices to fulfil critical functions and make essential contributions to life on land. Closing gaps in biodiversity research in mountain soil is crucial to enhance our understanding and to promote laws and guidelines advancing international soil biodiversity conservation targets in mountains. Addressing sparse and biased data, recognizing the impact of environmental changes on mountain ecosystems, and advocating dedicated policies are essential strategies to safeguard mountain soils and their biodiversity.

P.; Beger, M.; Carr, I. M.; Taylor, M.; Valsecchi, E.; Goodman, S. J.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572838\nMarine mammal foraging grounds are popular focal points for marine protected area (MPA) implementation, but may be temporally dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring to infer prey availability and abundance. Marine mammal distributions are assumed to be driven by their prey in foraging areas, but limited understanding of prey distributions often prevents us from exploring how shifting prey availability impacts both seasonal and long-term marine mammal distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding could enhance understanding of marine mammal habitat use in relation to their prey through simultaneous monitoring of both. However, eDNA applications focused on marine mammals or predator-prey dynamics have been limited to date. In this study, we assess spatiotemporal changes in the availability and abundance of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) prey species in a newly established MPA, employing eDNA metabarcoding. We recovered 105 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from marine vertebrates using two primer sets targeting 12S and 16S genes, along with 112 OTUs from a broader eukaryotic primer set targeting 18S rRNA. Overall, key forage fish prey species, sandeels and clupeids, were the most abundant teleost fishes detected, although their availability varied temporally and with distance from shore. We also found clear spatial partitioning between coastal bottlenose dolphins and the more pelagic minke whales and harbour porpoises, paralleling availability of their main prey species. Other species of conservation interest were also detected including the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), blue fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), and the invasive pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This study demonstrates the application of eDNA to detect spatiotemporal trends in the occurrence and abundance of cetacean predators and their prey, furthering our understanding of fine-scale habitat use within MPAs. Future, long-term monitoring of predator-prey dynamics with eDNA could improve our ability to predict climate-induced shifts in foraging grounds and enhance rapid responses with appropriate management actions.\nComplex life cycles and parasite-mediated trophic cascades drive species coexistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity\nAuthors: Hijar-Islas, A. C.; Mon Pere, N. V.; Huang, W.; Eizaguirre, C.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.571902\nEcological and evolutionary processes shape the dynamics of interacting species, yet the drivers of eco-evolutionary feedback remain elusive. Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.\nDining in the daylight: Nocturnal rhinoceros beetles extend feeding periods on host trees with reduced sap exudation\nAuthors: Kanda, A.; Shibata, R.; Ueno, T.; Yamashita, N.; Kojima, W.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573284\nWhile the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus typically feeds on the sap of the oak Quercus acutissima and the crape myrtle Lagerstroemia subcostata during the night, it exhibits feeding activity both during the day and night when it utilizes the ash tree Fraxinus griffithii. However, the mechanisms underlying the variations in temporal activity patterns remain unknown. We compared feeding rates (measured as body mass increments) and sap exudation rates among F. griffithii, Q. acutissima, and L. subcostata. We found that beetles feeding on L. subcostata and Q. acutissima exhibited significantly higher feeding rates than those feeding on F. griffithii. No significant differences in feeding rates were observed between L. subcostata and Q. acutissima. The sap exudation rate was significantly higher for Q. acutissima than for F. griffithii. However, there were no significant differences in the sap exudation rates between F. griffithii and L. subcostata or between Q. acutissima and L. subcostata. These findings suggest that lower feeding rates on F. griffithii prolong the feeding duration, resulting in daytime activity. While the low sap exudation in L. subcostata seems inconsistent with high feeding rates on this host, this apparent contradiction could be related to the extended duration of sap exudation.\nTrophic microRNA: Precursor and mature microRNA ingestion downregulates the target transcripts and hampers larval development in Plutella xylostella\nAuthors: Bardapurkar, R.; Pandit, S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572757\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators. In the miRNA pathways cytoplasmic part, the miRNA is processed from a hairpin-structured precursor (pre-miRNA) to a double-stranded (ds) mature RNA and ultimately to a single-stranded mature miRNA. In insects, ingesting these two ds forms can regulate the target gene expression; this inspired the trophic miRNAs use as a functional genomics and pest management tool. However, systematic studies enabling comparisons of pre- and mature forms, dosages, administration times, and instar-wise effects on target transcripts and phenotypes, which can help develop a miRNA administration method, are unavailable due to the different focuses of the previous investigations. We investigated the impact of trophically delivered Px-let-7 miRNA on the Brassicaceae pest, Plutella xylostella, to compare the efficacies of its pre- and ds-mature forms. Continuous feeding on the miRNA-supplemented diet suppressed expressions of FTZ-F1 and E74, the target ecdysone pathway genes. Both the pre-let-7 and mature let-7 miRNA forms similarly downregulated the target transcripts in all four larval instars. Pre-let-7 and let-7 ingestions decreased P. xylostellas larval mass and instar duration and increased mortality in all instars, exhibiting adverse effects on larval growth and development. Pre-miRNA processing Dicer-1 was upregulated upon pre-let-7 ingestion, indicating the miRNA uptake by the midgut cells. The scrambled sequence controls did not affect the target transcripts, suggesting the sequence-specific targeting by the mature miRNA and hairpin cassettes non-involvement in the target downregulation. This work provides a framework for miRNA and target gene function analyses and potentiates the trophic miRNAs utility in pest management.\nWinners in good times and bad times: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria profit from photoheterotrophy under carbon-rich and poor conditions\nAuthors: Piwosz, K.; Villena-Alemany, C.; Calkiewicz, J.; Mujakic, I.; Nahlik, V.; Dean, J.; Koblizek, M.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572764\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/572764v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\"\u003e View larger version (30K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cbbb50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@76b773org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ff0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac236f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are an important component of freshwater bacterioplankton. They can support their heterotrophic metabolism with energy from light, and by that enhance their growth efficiency. Based on results from cultures, it was hypothesized that photoheterotrophy provides an advantage under carbon limitation and facilitates access to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources. However, verification of these hypotheses for natural AAP communities has been lacking. Here, we conducted whole community manipulation experiments and compared the growth of AAP bacteria under carbon limited and with recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources under dark and light conditions to elucidate how they profit from photoheterotrophy. We found that it depends on the season. In spring, AAP bacteria induce photoheterotrophic metabolism under carbon limitation but they outperform heterotrophic bacteria when carbon is available. This effect seems to be driven by physiological responses rather than changes at the community level. In autumn photoheterotrophy is less beneficial. In both seasons, AAP bacteria responded negatively to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources in light. This unexpected observation may have ecosystem-level consequences as lake browning continues. In general, our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of AAP bacteria observed in pelagic environments.\nConcerns on research history overview, distribution patterns, and potentially neglected ecological consequences of the invasive apple snail (Pomacea sp.): A review\nAuthors: Luo, D.; Li, Y.; Li, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573227\nInvasive species pose a threat to global ecosystems and biodiversity, with the apple snail standing out as one kind of the worst invasive species due to its exclusive expansion. In order to draw a conceptual framework of its invasion pattern from an overview, we endeavor to conduct a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to explore the existing knowledge on research history and subjective categorization of Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata, and to uncover emerging trends of distribution and possible neglected impact on food webs. The research history reveals that the first international research publication was documented in 1958. However, a substantial increase in international publications occurred only after 2000. The adoption and effective implementation of a universally agreed upon management strategy may greatly enhance the progress of research on apple snail invasion. Notably, co-word analysis revealed that the content of each thematic cluster has a shift from basic biology to the monitoring of occurrences and environmental adaptation. Currently, the global distribution of apple snails has expanded to 39 countries primarily as a result of anthropogenic translocation. All infested countries, with the exception of Israel and Singapore, are major paddy rice producers. The northernmost distribution limit is Tyumen in Russia, while the southernmost limit is the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Biological control has emerged as a prominent technology for the prevention of apple snail infestations, leading to the identification of 98 non-target enemy species as potential control agents. A taxonomic diversity analysis revealed that these species encompassed a wide range of phylogenetic classifications, including 6 Phyla, 12 Classes, 33 Orders, 55 Families, and 82 Genera. This observation suggests that there is a substantial pool of animals from diverse phylogenetic levels that can prey upon apple snails. Given the high population density and extensive distribution of apple snails, there is a pressing need for further research to explore their potential ecological ramifications. The current understanding of the upward ecological impacts of apple snails remains inadequate. These findings provide valuable insights for future research endeavors and contribute to the effective management of invasive apple snail populations.\nEffects of sampling methodology on phenology indices: insights from sites across India and modelling\nAuthors: Tiruvaimozhi, Y.; Teegalapalli, K.; Reddy, A.; Murali, A.; Datta, A.; Krishnan, A.; Ratnam, J.; Sankaran, M.; Ongole, S.; Kasinathan, S.; Raman, T. R. S.; Ramaswami, G.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573352\nPlant phenology is the study of timing and extent of leaf, flower, and fruit production. Phenology data are used to study drivers of cyclicity and seasonality of plant life-history stages, interactions with organisms such as pollinators, and effects of global change factors. Indices such as timing of phenological events, proportion of individuals in a particular phenophase, seasonality, and synchrony have often been used to summarise plant phenology data. However, these indices have specific utilities and limitations and may be sensitive to sampling methodology, making cross-site comparisons challenging, particularly when data collection methods vary in terms of sample size, observation frequency, and the resolution at which phenophase intensity scores/values are recorded. We use fruiting phenology data from tropical trees across five sites in India to study the effects of sampling methodology on two indices: an index of population-level synchrony (overlap), and an index of seasonality. We supplement these results with simulations of fast- and slow-changing phenologies to test for the effects of sampling methodology on these indices. We found that the overlap index is sensitive to the phenophase intensity measurement resolution--with coarser intensity measures leading to overestimation of the overlap index. The seasonality index, on the other hand, was not affected by intensity resolution. Simulations indicated that finer intensity resolution is more important than frequency of observation to accurately estimate population synchrony and seasonality for fast- and slow-changing phenophases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for study design of future tropical tree phenology research, particularly for long-term or cross-site studies.\nEmerging dynamic regimes and tipping points from finite empirical principles\nAuthors: Cobo-Lopez, S.; Witt, M.; Rohwer, F. L.; Luque, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573307\nAll dynamical systems are transient. The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.\nSpecies interactions drive continuous assembly of freshwater communities in stochastic environments\nAuthors: Tabi, A.; Siqueira, T.; Tonkin, J. D.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572946\nUnderstanding the factors driving the maintenance of long-term biodiversity in changing environments is essential for improving restoration and sustainability strategies in the face of global environmental change. Biodiversity is shaped by both niche and stochastic processes, however the strength of deterministic processes in unpredictable environmental regimes is highly debated. Since communities continuously change over time and space -- species persist, disappear or (re)appear -- understanding the drivers of species gains and losses from communities should inform us about whether niche or stochastic processes dominate community dynamics. Applying a nonparametric causal discovery approach to a 30-year time series containing annual abundances of benthic invertebrates across 66 locations in New Zealand rivers, we found a strong asynchronous causal relationship between species gains and losses directly driven by predation indicating that niche processes dominate community dynamics. Despite the unpredictable nature of these system, environmental noise was only indirectly related to species gains and losses through altering life history trait distribution. Using a stochastic birth-death framework, we demonstrate that the negative relationship between species gains and losses can not emerge without strong niche processes. Our results showed that even in systems that are dominated by unpredictable environmental variability, species interactions drive continuous community assembly.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Despite the importance of healthy soils for human livelihood, wellbeing, and safety, current gaps in our knowledge and understanding of biodiversity in soil are numerous, undermining conservation efforts. These gaps are particularly wide in mountain regions where healthy soils are especially important for human safety and yet evidence is accumulating of ongoing degradation, posing significant threats to ecosystem functioning and human settlements.

To analyse these gaps in detail, we synthesise current research on the global diversity of microorganisms, cryptogams, and invertebrates in mountain soils above the treeline. This synthesis is based on a semi-quantitative survey of the literature and an expert-based analysis. Our work reveals not only deficiencies in geographic cover but also significant gaps in taxonomic coverage, particularly among soil protists and invertebrates, and a lack of (functional and ecological) description of the uncultivated majority of prokaryotes, fungi, and protists. We subsequently build on this overview to highlight opportunities for research on mountain soils as systems of co-occurring species that interact in complex environmental matrices to fulfil critical functions and make essential contributions to life on land.

Closing gaps in biodiversity research in mountain soil is crucial to enhance our understanding and to promote laws and guidelines advancing international soil biodiversity conservation targets in mountains. Addressing sparse and biased data, recognizing the impact of environmental changes on mountain ecosystems, and advocating dedicated policies are essential strategies to safeguard mountain soils and their biodiversity.

        <p class="abstract">Marine mammal foraging grounds are popular focal points for marine protected area (MPA) implementation, but may be temporally dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring to infer prey availability and abundance. Marine mammal distributions are assumed to be driven by their prey in foraging areas, but limited understanding of prey distributions often prevents us from exploring how shifting prey availability impacts both seasonal and long-term marine mammal distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding could enhance understanding of marine mammal habitat use in relation to their prey through simultaneous monitoring of both. However, eDNA applications focused on marine mammals or predator-prey dynamics have been limited to date. In this study, we assess spatiotemporal changes in the availability and abundance of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) prey species in a newly established MPA, employing eDNA metabarcoding. We recovered 105 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from marine vertebrates using two primer sets targeting 12S and 16S genes, along with 112 OTUs from a broader eukaryotic primer set targeting 18S rRNA. Overall, key forage fish prey species, sandeels and clupeids, were the most abundant teleost fishes detected, although their availability varied temporally and with distance from shore. We also found clear spatial partitioning between coastal bottlenose dolphins and the more pelagic minke whales and harbour porpoises, paralleling availability of their main prey species. Other species of conservation interest were also detected including the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), blue fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), and the invasive pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This study demonstrates the application of eDNA to detect spatiotemporal trends in the occurrence and abundance of cetacean predators and their prey, furthering our understanding of fine-scale habitat use within MPAs. Future, long-term monitoring of predator-prey dynamics with eDNA could improve our ability to predict climate-induced shifts in foraging grounds and enhance rapid responses with appropriate management actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecological and evolutionary processes shape the dynamics of interacting species, yet the drivers of eco-evolutionary feedback remain elusive. Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus typically feeds on the sap of the oak Quercus acutissima and the crape myrtle Lagerstroemia subcostata during the night, it exhibits feeding activity both during the day and night when it utilizes the ash tree Fraxinus griffithii. However, the mechanisms underlying the variations in temporal activity patterns remain unknown. We compared feeding rates (measured as body mass increments) and sap exudation rates among F. griffithii, Q. acutissima, and L. subcostata. We found that beetles feeding on L. subcostata and Q. acutissima exhibited significantly higher feeding rates than those feeding on F. griffithii. No significant differences in feeding rates were observed between L. subcostata and Q. acutissima. The sap exudation rate was significantly higher for Q. acutissima than for F. griffithii. However, there were no significant differences in the sap exudation rates between F. griffithii and L. subcostata or between Q. acutissima and L. subcostata. These findings suggest that lower feeding rates on F. griffithii prolong the feeding duration, resulting in daytime activity. While the low sap exudation in L. subcostata seems inconsistent with high feeding rates on this host, this apparent contradiction could be related to the extended duration of sap exudation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators. In the miRNA pathways cytoplasmic part, the miRNA is processed from a hairpin-structured precursor (pre-miRNA) to a double-stranded (ds) mature RNA and ultimately to a single-stranded mature miRNA. In insects, ingesting these two ds forms can regulate the target gene expression; this inspired the trophic miRNAs use as a functional genomics and pest management tool. However, systematic studies enabling comparisons of pre- and mature forms, dosages, administration times, and instar-wise effects on target transcripts and phenotypes, which can help develop a miRNA administration method, are unavailable due to the different focuses of the previous investigations. We investigated the impact of trophically delivered Px-let-7 miRNA on the Brassicaceae pest, Plutella xylostella, to compare the efficacies of its pre- and ds-mature forms. Continuous feeding on the miRNA-supplemented diet suppressed expressions of FTZ-F1 and E74, the target ecdysone pathway genes. Both the pre-let-7 and mature let-7 miRNA forms similarly downregulated the target transcripts in all four larval instars. Pre-let-7 and let-7 ingestions decreased P. xylostellas larval mass and instar duration and increased mortality in all instars, exhibiting adverse effects on larval growth and development. Pre-miRNA processing Dicer-1 was upregulated upon pre-let-7 ingestion, indicating the miRNA uptake by the midgut cells. The scrambled sequence controls did not affect the target transcripts, suggesting the sequence-specific targeting by the mature miRNA and hairpin cassettes non-involvement in the target downregulation. This work provides a framework for miRNA and target gene function analyses and potentiates the trophic miRNAs utility in pest management.</p>

They can support their heterotrophic metabolism with energy from light, and by that enhance their growth efficiency. Based on results from cultures, it was hypothesized that photoheterotrophy provides an advantage under carbon limitation and facilitates access to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources. However, verification of these hypotheses for natural AAP communities has been lacking. Here, we conducted whole community manipulation experiments and compared the growth of AAP bacteria under carbon limited and with recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources under dark and light conditions to elucidate how they profit from photoheterotrophy. We found that it depends on the season. In spring, AAP bacteria induce photoheterotrophic metabolism under carbon limitation but they outperform heterotrophic bacteria when carbon is available. This effect seems to be driven by physiological responses rather than changes at the community level. In autumn photoheterotrophy is less beneficial. In both seasons, AAP bacteria responded negatively to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources in light. This unexpected observation may have ecosystem-level consequences as lake browning continues. In general, our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of AAP bacteria observed in pelagic environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invasive species pose a threat to global ecosystems and biodiversity, with the apple snail standing out as one kind of the worst invasive species due to its exclusive expansion. In order to draw a conceptual framework of its invasion pattern from an overview, we endeavor to conduct a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to explore the existing knowledge on research history and subjective categorization of Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata, and to uncover emerging trends of distribution and possible neglected impact on food webs. The research history reveals that the first international research publication was documented in 1958. However, a substantial increase in international publications occurred only after 2000. The adoption and effective implementation of a universally agreed upon management strategy may greatly enhance the progress of research on apple snail invasion. Notably, co-word analysis revealed that the content of each thematic cluster has a shift from basic biology to the monitoring of occurrences and environmental adaptation. Currently, the global distribution of apple snails has expanded to 39 countries primarily as a result of anthropogenic translocation. All infested countries, with the exception of Israel and Singapore, are major paddy rice producers. The northernmost distribution limit is Tyumen in Russia, while the southernmost limit is the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Biological control has emerged as a prominent technology for the prevention of apple snail infestations, leading to the identification of 98 non-target enemy species as potential control agents. A taxonomic diversity analysis revealed that these species encompassed a wide range of phylogenetic classifications, including 6 Phyla, 12 Classes, 33 Orders, 55 Families, and 82 Genera. This observation suggests that there is a substantial pool of animals from diverse phylogenetic levels that can prey upon apple snails. Given the high population density and extensive distribution of apple snails, there is a pressing need for further research to explore their potential ecological ramifications. The current understanding of the upward ecological impacts of apple snails remains inadequate. These findings provide valuable insights for future research endeavors and contribute to the effective management of invasive apple snail populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant phenology is the study of timing and extent of leaf, flower, and fruit production. Phenology data are used to study drivers of cyclicity and seasonality of plant life-history stages, interactions with organisms such as pollinators, and effects of global change factors. Indices such as timing of phenological events, proportion of individuals in a particular phenophase, seasonality, and synchrony have often been used to summarise plant phenology data. However, these indices have specific utilities and limitations and may be sensitive to sampling methodology, making cross-site comparisons challenging, particularly when data collection methods vary in terms of sample size, observation frequency, and the resolution at which phenophase intensity scores/values are recorded. We use fruiting phenology data from tropical trees across five sites in India to study the effects of sampling methodology on two indices: an index of population-level synchrony (overlap), and an index of seasonality. We supplement these results with simulations of fast- and slow-changing phenologies to test for the effects of sampling methodology on these indices. We found that the overlap index is sensitive to the phenophase intensity measurement resolution--with coarser intensity measures leading to overestimation of the overlap index. The seasonality index, on the other hand, was not affected by intensity resolution. Simulations indicated that finer intensity resolution is more important than frequency of observation to accurately estimate population synchrony and seasonality for fast- and slow-changing phenophases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for study design of future tropical tree phenology research, particularly for long-term or cross-site studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All dynamical systems are transient. The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the factors driving the maintenance of long-term biodiversity in changing environments is essential for improving restoration and sustainability strategies in the face of global environmental change. Biodiversity is shaped by both niche and stochastic processes, however the strength of deterministic processes in unpredictable environmental regimes is highly debated. Since communities continuously change over time and space -- species persist, disappear or (re)appear -- understanding the drivers of species gains and losses from communities should inform us about whether niche or stochastic processes dominate community dynamics. Applying a nonparametric causal discovery approach to a 30-year time series containing annual abundances of benthic invertebrates across 66 locations in New Zealand rivers, we found a strong asynchronous causal relationship between species gains and losses directly driven by predation indicating that niche processes dominate community dynamics. Despite the unpredictable nature of these system, environmental noise was only indirectly related to species gains and losses through altering life history trait distribution. Using a stochastic birth-death framework, we demonstrate that the negative relationship between species gains and losses can not emerge without strong niche processes. Our results showed that even in systems that are dominated by unpredictable environmental variability, species interactions drive continuous community assembly.</p>
