Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.\nA taxonomy of multiple stable states in complex ecological communities\nAuthors: Aguade-Gorgorio, G.; Arnoldi, J.-F.; Barbier, M.; Kefi, S.\nScore: 21.3, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555051\nMany natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.\nSpatial patterns in the diet of Gyps vultures in India and their implications for conservation\nAuthors: Ghosh-Harihar, M.; Yadav, N.; Gurung, N.; C.S., D.; B., S.; C.K., V.; Prakash, V.; Green, R. E.; Ramakrishnan, U.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554114\nDietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in \u003e95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.\nConservation value of low-elevation forests for birds in agroforestry-dominated landscapes in a biodiversity hotspot\nAuthors: Biswas, N.; Biniwale, S.; Sadekar, V.; Taneja, Y. V.; Suryawanshi, K.; Osuri, A. M.; Naniwadekar, R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.554947\nO_LIProtected areas (PAs) and multi-use landscapes beyond PAs play important and complementary roles in conserving global biodiversity. Across the tropical forest biome, remnant forests and agroforestry plantations in mixed-use landscapes often have high taxonomic diversity, but their ability to sustain functionally and phylogenetically diverse assemblages and retain conservation-priority species is unclear. Additionally, our understanding of impacts of land-use change across species, function and communities is poor. C_LIO_LIIn Indias Western Ghats (WG) biodiversity hotspot, like in many other tropical regions, PAs cover just 12% of the land and are concentrated in higher elevations. Here, in an approximately 15,000 km2 landscape in the northern WG, we compared bird communities across six land-use categories: state-owned high-elevation PAs and low-elevation Reserved Forests beyond PAs, and privately-owned periodically clear-felled low-elevation forests and three types of low-elevation agroforestry plantations (cashew, mango, and rubber). C_LIO_LIWe sampled 184 line transects totalling 137.5 km across habitats, compared taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics and used joint species distribution models to test for species-trait-habitat associations. C_LIO_LIForests in general and lowland forests in particular had higher taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and higher occurrence probabilities of evergreen forest-affiliated, conservation-priority, and frugivores than agroforestry plantations. The ranking of land-use types varied across indicators, with rubber ranking higher than cashew and mango for functional and phylogenetic diversity but lower in species occurrence probabilities. C_LIO_LISynthesis and Applications: Our findings underscore the irreplaceability of less-disturbed forests for birds in mixed-use landscapes, especially when considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity, habitat specialists, and conservation-priority species. We advocate the simultaneous examination at multiple levels (community, species and traits) to determine the impacts of land-use change as divergent information of conservation importance is gleaned from each level. Reserved and private forests of low elevations of the Northern Western Ghats are critical for avian conservation, given that they harbour significant diversity, and the absence of representative PAs in the region. Given the vulnerability of these low-elevation forests to conversion for non-forestry activities and overexploitation for fuelwood, there is a need to develop viable models of partnership with landowners in these multi-use landscapes for ecological restoration of degraded forests.

S.; Huang, X.; Luo, Y.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.552557\nIn the accompanying Comment1, He et al. argue that the determinant role of microbial carbon use efficiency in global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage shown in Tao et al. (2023)2 was overestimated because carbon inputs were neglected in our data analysis while they suggest that our model-based analysis could be biased and model-dependent. Their argument is based on a different choice of independent variables in the data analysis and a sensitivity analysis of two process-based models other than that used in our study. We agree that both carbon inputs and outputs (as mediated by microbial processes) matter when predicting SOC storage - the question is their relative contributions. While we encourage further studies to examine how the evaluation of the relative importance of CUE to global SOC storage may vary with different model structures, He et al.s claims about Tao et al. (2023) need to be taken as an alternative, unproven hypothesis until empirical data support their specific parameterization. Here we show that an additional literature assessment of global data does not support He et al.s argument, in contrast to our study, and that further study on this topic is essential.\nSaccharomycotina yeasts defy longstanding macroecological patterns\nAuthors: David, K. T.; Harrison, M.-C.; Opulente, D. A.; LaBella, A. L.; Wolters, J. F.; Zhou, X.; Shen, X.-X.; Groenewald, M.; Pennell, M.; Hittinger, C. T.; Rokas, A.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555417\nThe Saccharomycotina yeasts (\"yeasts\" hereafter) are a fungal clade of scientific, economic, and medical significance. Yeasts are highly ecologically diverse, found across a broad range of environments in every biome and continent on earth1; however, little is known about what rules govern the macroecology of yeast species and their range limits in the wild2. Here, we trained machine learning models on 12,221 occurrence records and 96 environmental variables to infer global distribution maps for 186 yeast species ([~]15% of described species from 75% of orders) and to test environmental drivers of yeast biogeography and macroecology. We found that predicted yeast diversity hotspots occur in mixed montane forests in temperate climates. Diversity in vegetation type and topography were some of the greatest predictors of yeast species richness, suggesting that microhabitats and environmental clines are key to yeast diversification. We further found that range limits in yeasts are significantly influenced by carbon niche breadth and range overlap with other yeast species, with carbon specialists and species in high diversity environments exhibiting reduced geographic ranges. Finally, yeasts contravene many longstanding macroecological principles, including the latitudinal diversity gradient, temperature-dependent species richness, and latitude-dependent range size (Rapoports rule). These results unveil how the environment governs the global diversity and distribution of species in the yeast subphylum. These high-resolution models of yeast species distributions will facilitate the prediction of economically relevant and emerging pathogenic species under current and future climate scenarios.\nProvision of essential resources as a persistence strategy in food webs\nAuthors: Raatz, M.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.27.525839\nPairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.\nHow frequently are insects wounded in the wild? A case study using Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Subasi, B. S.; Grabe, V.; Kaltenpoth, M.; Rolff, J.; Armitage, S. A. O.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554863\nO_LIWounding occurs across multicellular organisms. There is a deep understanding of infections and immune responses from lab studies, yet wounds remain relatively comparatively understudied in nature. Ecological interactions like predator attacks, intra- and inter-specific competition can lead to wounding. Furthermore, rates of wounding may vary depending on factors such as sex and geographic location, with consequences for host mobility, reproduction, and susceptibility to pathogens. C_LIO_LIWounds initiate an immune response, resulting in the deposition of the brown-black pigment melanin in insects, and they are potential entry points for pathogens. Despite the potential ecological and evolutionary implications of wounding, and the relative abundance of lab immunity studies utilising Drosophila melanogaster, wounding in the wild in this model is unstudied. Our aim, therefore, was to investigate the prevalence and examine potential causes of wounds in wild-collected D. melanogaster. C_LIO_LIFrom systematic collections of female and male flies, over three seasons and locations, we found that 31% of D. melanogaster were wounded. The abdomen was more frequently wounded than other body parts, and females were more likely to be injured particularly on the ventral abdomen, compared to males. Encapsulated parasitoid egg frequency was just under ten percent. Moreover, just under one percent of Drosophilidae species had mites attached to their body, the majority of which also caused wounds, i.e., were potentially parasitic. C_LIO_LIWounding is prevalent in D. melanogaster, and as such it is likely to exert selection pressure on host immunity for two reasons: on a rapid and efficient wound repair, and on responding to opportunistic infections. Wounds are thus expected to be important drivers of immune system evolution and to affect individual fitness and population dynamics.

A.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555493\nEmerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.\nMethods for tagging an ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis\nAuthors: Folk, A.; Mennerat, A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555695\nMonitoring individuals within populations is a cornerstone in evolutionary ecology, yet individual tracking of invertebrates and particularly parasitic organisms remains rare. To address this gap, we describe here a method for attaching radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to individual adult females of a marine ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Comparing two alternative types of glue, we found that one of them (2-octyl cyanoacrylate, 2oc) gave a significantly higher tag retention rate than the other (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, e2c). This glue comparison test also resulted in a higher loss rate of adult ectoparasites from the population where tagging was done using 2oc, but this included males not tagged and thus could also suggest a mere tank effect. Corroborating this, a more extensive analysis using data collected over two years showed no significant difference in mortality after repeated exposure to the 2oc glue, nor did it show any significant effect of the tagging procedure on the reproduction of female salmon lice. The RFID tags were lost linearly over time, with the percentage of the living female population that retained their original tags declining by 0.28 percent.day-1. In other words, tag retention was in general high, with a typical projected retention of about 89% after 30 days or 80% after 60 days, although one of the four batches of glue used, purchased from a different supplier, appeared to give significantly lower tag retention and with greater initial loss (70% and 53% respectively). Overall, we find that RFID tagging is a simple and effective technology that enables documenting individual life histories for invertebrates of a suitable size, including marine and parasitic species, and that it can be used over long periods of study.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in &gt;95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIProtected areas (PAs) and multi-use landscapes beyond PAs play important and complementary roles in conserving global biodiversity. Across the tropical forest biome, remnant forests and agroforestry plantations in mixed-use landscapes often have high taxonomic diversity, but their ability to sustain functionally and phylogenetically diverse assemblages and retain conservation-priority species is unclear. Additionally, our understanding of impacts of land-use change across species, function and communities is poor.
C_LIO_LIIn Indias Western Ghats (WG) biodiversity hotspot, like in many other tropical regions, PAs cover just 12% of the land and are concentrated in higher elevations. Here, in an approximately 15,000 km2 landscape in the northern WG, we compared bird communities across six land-use categories: state-owned high-elevation PAs and low-elevation Reserved Forests beyond PAs, and privately-owned periodically clear-felled low-elevation forests and three types of low-elevation agroforestry plantations (cashew, mango, and rubber).
C_LIO_LIWe sampled 184 line transects totalling 137.5 km across habitats, compared taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics and used joint species distribution models to test for species-trait-habitat associations.
C_LIO_LIForests in general and lowland forests in particular had higher taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and higher occurrence probabilities of evergreen forest-affiliated, conservation-priority, and frugivores than agroforestry plantations. The ranking of land-use types varied across indicators, with rubber ranking higher than cashew and mango for functional and phylogenetic diversity but lower in species occurrence probabilities.
C_LIO_LISynthesis and Applications: Our findings underscore the irreplaceability of less-disturbed forests for birds in mixed-use landscapes, especially when considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity, habitat specialists, and conservation-priority species. We advocate the simultaneous examination at multiple levels (community, species and traits) to determine the impacts of land-use change as divergent information of conservation importance is gleaned from each level. Reserved and private forests of low elevations of the Northern Western Ghats are critical for avian conservation, given that they harbour significant diversity, and the absence of representative PAs in the region. Given the vulnerability of these low-elevation forests to conversion for non-forestry activities and overexploitation for fuelwood, there is a need to develop viable models of partnership with landowners in these multi-use landscapes for ecological restoration of degraded forests.

        <p class="abstract">In the accompanying Comment1, He et al. argue that the determinant role of microbial carbon use efficiency in global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage shown in Tao et al. (2023)2 was overestimated because carbon inputs were neglected in our data analysis while they suggest that our model-based analysis could be biased and model-dependent. Their argument is based on a different choice of independent variables in the data analysis and a sensitivity analysis of two process-based models other than that used in our study. We agree that both carbon inputs and outputs (as mediated by microbial processes) matter when predicting SOC storage - the question is their relative contributions. While we encourage further studies to examine how the evaluation of the relative importance of CUE to global SOC storage may vary with different model structures, He et al.s claims about Tao et al. (2023) need to be taken as an alternative, unproven hypothesis until empirical data support their specific parameterization. Here we show that an additional literature assessment of global data does not support He et al.s argument, in contrast to our study, and that further study on this topic is essential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Saccharomycotina yeasts (&#34;yeasts&#34; hereafter) are a fungal clade of scientific, economic, and medical significance. Yeasts are highly ecologically diverse, found across a broad range of environments in every biome and continent on earth1; however, little is known about what rules govern the macroecology of yeast species and their range limits in the wild2. Here, we trained machine learning models on 12,221 occurrence records and 96 environmental variables to infer global distribution maps for 186 yeast species ([~]15% of described species from 75% of orders) and to test environmental drivers of yeast biogeography and macroecology. We found that predicted yeast diversity hotspots occur in mixed montane forests in temperate climates. Diversity in vegetation type and topography were some of the greatest predictors of yeast species richness, suggesting that microhabitats and environmental clines are key to yeast diversification. We further found that range limits in yeasts are significantly influenced by carbon niche breadth and range overlap with other yeast species, with carbon specialists and species in high diversity environments exhibiting reduced geographic ranges. Finally, yeasts contravene many longstanding macroecological principles, including the latitudinal diversity gradient, temperature-dependent species richness, and latitude-dependent range size (Rapoports rule). These results unveil how the environment governs the global diversity and distribution of species in the yeast subphylum. These high-resolution models of yeast species distributions will facilitate the prediction of economically relevant and emerging pathogenic species under current and future climate scenarios.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIWounding occurs across multicellular organisms. There is a deep understanding of infections and immune responses from lab studies, yet wounds remain relatively comparatively understudied in nature. Ecological interactions like predator attacks, intra- and inter-specific competition can lead to wounding. Furthermore, rates of wounding may vary depending on factors such as sex and geographic location, with consequences for host mobility, reproduction, and susceptibility to pathogens.
C_LIO_LIWounds initiate an immune response, resulting in the deposition of the brown-black pigment melanin in insects, and they are potential entry points for pathogens. Despite the potential ecological and evolutionary implications of wounding, and the relative abundance of lab immunity studies utilising Drosophila melanogaster, wounding in the wild in this model is unstudied. Our aim, therefore, was to investigate the prevalence and examine potential causes of wounds in wild-collected D. melanogaster.
C_LIO_LIFrom systematic collections of female and male flies, over three seasons and locations, we found that 31% of D. melanogaster were wounded. The abdomen was more frequently wounded than other body parts, and females were more likely to be injured particularly on the ventral abdomen, compared to males. Encapsulated parasitoid egg frequency was just under ten percent. Moreover, just under one percent of Drosophilidae species had mites attached to their body, the majority of which also caused wounds, i.e., were potentially parasitic.
C_LIO_LIWounding is prevalent in D. melanogaster, and as such it is likely to exert selection pressure on host immunity for two reasons: on a rapid and efficient wound repair, and on responding to opportunistic infections. Wounds are thus expected to be important drivers of immune system evolution and to affect individual fitness and population dynamics.

        <p class="abstract">Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring individuals within populations is a cornerstone in evolutionary ecology, yet individual tracking of invertebrates and particularly parasitic organisms remains rare. To address this gap, we describe here a method for attaching radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to individual adult females of a marine ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Comparing two alternative types of glue, we found that one of them (2-octyl cyanoacrylate, 2oc) gave a significantly higher tag retention rate than the other (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, e2c). This glue comparison test also resulted in a higher loss rate of adult ectoparasites from the population where tagging was done using 2oc, but this included males not tagged and thus could also suggest a mere tank effect. Corroborating this, a more extensive analysis using data collected over two years showed no significant difference in mortality after repeated exposure to the 2oc glue, nor did it show any significant effect of the tagging procedure on the reproduction of female salmon lice. The RFID tags were lost linearly over time, with the percentage of the living female population that retained their original tags declining by 0.28 percent.day-1. In other words, tag retention was in general high, with a typical projected retention of about 89% after 30 days or 80% after 60 days, although one of the four batches of glue used, purchased from a different supplier, appeared to give significantly lower tag retention and with greater initial loss (70% and 53% respectively). Overall, we find that RFID tagging is a simple and effective technology that enables documenting individual life histories for invertebrates of a suitable size, including marine and parasitic species, and that it can be used over long periods of study.</p>
