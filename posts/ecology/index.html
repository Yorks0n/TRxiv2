C.\nScore: 36.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559203\nFive years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.\nDeep learning to extract the meteorological by-catch of wildlife cameras\nAuthors: Alison, J.; Payne, S.; Alexander, J. M.; Bjorkman, A. D.; Clarke, V. R.; Gwate, O.; Huntsaar, M.; Iseli, E.; Lenoir, J.; Mann, H. M. R.; Steenhuisen, S.-L.; Hoye, T. T.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.558780\nMicroclimate - proximal climatic variation at scales of meters and minutes - can exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. However, most microclimate studies are temperature-centric, and do not consider meteorological factors such as sunshine, hail and snow. Meanwhile, remote cameras have become a primary tool to monitor wild plants and animals, even at micro-scales, with deep learning tools to rapidly convert images into ecological data. However, deep learning applications for wildlife imagery have focused exclusively on living subjects. Here, we identify an overlooked opportunity to extract latent, yet ecologically relevant, meteorological information. We produce an annotated image dataset of micrometeorological conditions across 49 wildlife cameras in South Africas Maloti-Drakensberg and the Swiss Alps. We train ensemble deep learning models to classify conditions as overcast, sunshine, hail or snow. Our best model achieves 91.7% accuracy on test cameras not seen during training. Furthermore, we show how effective accuracy is raised to 96% by disregarding 14.1% of classifications where ensemble member models did not reach a consensus. Unlike previous studies we test model performance in remote and novel locations, distinguishing overcast and sunny conditions in Svalbard, Norway with 79.3% accuracy (93.9% consensus accuracy). Our model rapidly classifies sunshine, snow and hail in almost 2 million unlabeled images. Resulting micrometeorological data illustrated common seasonal patterns of summer hailstorms and autumn snowfalls across mountains in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, daily patterns of sunshine and shade diverged between sites, impacting daily temperature cycles. Crucially, we leverage micrometeorological data to demonstrate that (1) experimental warming using open-top chambers shortens early snow events in autumn, and (2) image-derived sunshine marginally outperforms sensor-derived temperature when predicting bumblebee foraging. These methods generate novel micrometeorological variables in synchrony with biological recordings, enabling new insights from an increasingly global network of wildlife cameras.\nDisentangling non-random structure from random placement when estimating β-diversity through space or time\nAuthors: McGlinn, D.; Blowes, S. A.; Dornelas, M.; Engel, T.; Martins, I. S.; Shimadzu, H.; Gotelli, N. J.; Magurran, A.; McGill, B.; Chase, J. M.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558467\nThere is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.

D.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559030\nDiverse mammalian species display susceptibility to and infection with SARS-CoV-2. Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named Peromyscus coronavirus-1 and -2. Both belong to the Betacoronavirus 1 species and are [~]90% identical to the closest known relative, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk. However, the discovery of divergent, non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses expands the diversity of known rodent coronaviruses and further investigation is required to understand their transmission extent.\nBringing circuit theory into spatial occupancy models to assess landscape connectivity\nAuthors: Kervellec, M.; Couturier, T.; Bauduin, S.; Chenesseau, D.; Defos du Rau, P.; Drouet-Hoguet, N.; Duchamp, C.; Steinmetz, J.; Vandel, J.-M.; Gimenez, O.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559320\nConnectivity shapes species distribution across fragmented landscapes. Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.\nEvaluating goodness-of-fit of animal movement models using lineups\nAuthors: Fieberg, J.; Signer, J.; Freeman, S.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559591\nModels of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.\nA tipping point in West Antarctica in 2023's circumpolar 5-sigma event? a glimpse from the emperor penguin's perspective\nAuthors: Kruger, L.; Vianna, J. A.; Le Bohec, C.; Cardenas, C. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559910\nEmperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.\nHost-pathogen-vector continuum in a changing landscape: Drivers of Bartonella prevalence and evidence of historic spillover in a tropical multi-host community\nAuthors: Ansil, B. R.; Viswanathan, A.; Ramachandran, V.; Yeshwanth, H. M.; Sanyal, A.; Ramakrishnan, U.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559241\nOur understanding of pathogen spillover is largely based on viral systems associated with bats. Bacterial infections of zoonotic origin also pose a significant public health burden, many of which are associated with small mammals like rodents that live abundantly among humans. When ecologically different species of small mammals are brought in contact with each other due to various factors, including habitat modification, there is potential for bacterial spillover within the host community and subsequently to humans. Small mammals and their ectoparasite communities present a unique system to investigate the eco-epidemiology of multi-host pathogens, which can inform specific bacterial spillover determinants and their interplay. In a rainforest-human-use mosaic, we applied ecological and evolutionary analysis to investigate Bartonella spp. across small mammal and ectoparasite communities. We observed substantial overlap among small mammal communities in different habitat types, predominantly driven by habitat generalists. Most ectoparasites were generalists, infecting multiple hosts, and several host species displayed polyparasitism, i.e., they were infected by multiple ectoparasites. We observed high Bartonella prevalence at both study sites - a forest-plantation mosaic (47.4%) and a protected area (28.8%). Seven of the ten ectoparasite morphotypes sampled were also positive for Bartonella, following the prevalence trend in their hosts. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) revealed an independent association between aggregated ectoparasite load in species and Bartonella prevalence, implicating ectoparasites in transmission. Bartonella lineages from small mammals were host-specific, while ectoparasites showed no host-specific associations. They carried Bartonella associated with other hosts, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral trait reconstruction of Bartonella haplotypes suggests historic spillover events in the small mammal community, validating the potential for contemporary spillover. These results highlight infection risk from such underdiagnosed agents in the landscape, and the necessity to disentangle complex multi-host multi-vector systems to understand their epidemiological consequences.\nPatterns and drivers of pollen co-transport networks vary across pollinator groups\nAuthors: Carneiro, L. T.; Williams, J. N.; Barker, D. A.; Anderson, J. W.; Martel, C.; Arceo-Gomez, G.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558666\nPollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.\nSediment source and dose influence the larval performance of the threatened coral Orbicella faveolata\nAuthors: Serrano, X.; Rosales, S. M.; Miller, M. W.; Palacio-Castro, A. M.; Williamson, O. M.; Gomez, A.; Baker, A. C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559035\nThe effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Five years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microclimate - proximal climatic variation at scales of meters and minutes - can exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. However, most microclimate studies are temperature-centric, and do not consider meteorological factors such as sunshine, hail and snow. Meanwhile, remote cameras have become a primary tool to monitor wild plants and animals, even at micro-scales, with deep learning tools to rapidly convert images into ecological data. However, deep learning applications for wildlife imagery have focused exclusively on living subjects. Here, we identify an overlooked opportunity to extract latent, yet ecologically relevant, meteorological information.

We produce an annotated image dataset of micrometeorological conditions across 49 wildlife cameras in South Africas Maloti-Drakensberg and the Swiss Alps. We train ensemble deep learning models to classify conditions as overcast, sunshine, hail or snow. Our best model achieves 91.7% accuracy on test cameras not seen during training. Furthermore, we show how effective accuracy is raised to 96% by disregarding 14.1% of classifications where ensemble member models did not reach a consensus. Unlike previous studies we test model performance in remote and novel locations, distinguishing overcast and sunny conditions in Svalbard, Norway with 79.3% accuracy (93.9% consensus accuracy).

Our model rapidly classifies sunshine, snow and hail in almost 2 million unlabeled images. Resulting micrometeorological data illustrated common seasonal patterns of summer hailstorms and autumn snowfalls across mountains in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, daily patterns of sunshine and shade diverged between sites, impacting daily temperature cycles. Crucially, we leverage micrometeorological data to demonstrate that (1) experimental warming using open-top chambers shortens early snow events in autumn, and (2) image-derived sunshine marginally outperforms sensor-derived temperature when predicting bumblebee foraging. These methods generate novel micrometeorological variables in synchrony with biological recordings, enabling new insights from an increasingly global network of wildlife cameras.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.

        <p class="abstract">Diverse mammalian species display susceptibility to and infection with SARS-CoV-2. Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named Peromyscus coronavirus-1 and -2. Both belong to the Betacoronavirus 1 species and are [~]90% identical to the closest known relative, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk. However, the discovery of divergent, non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses expands the diversity of known rodent coronaviruses and further investigation is required to understand their transmission extent.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connectivity shapes species distribution across fragmented landscapes. Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Models of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our understanding of pathogen spillover is largely based on viral systems associated with bats. Bacterial infections of zoonotic origin also pose a significant public health burden, many of which are associated with small mammals like rodents that live abundantly among humans. When ecologically different species of small mammals are brought in contact with each other due to various factors, including habitat modification, there is potential for bacterial spillover within the host community and subsequently to humans. Small mammals and their ectoparasite communities present a unique system to investigate the eco-epidemiology of multi-host pathogens, which can inform specific bacterial spillover determinants and their interplay. In a rainforest-human-use mosaic, we applied ecological and evolutionary analysis to investigate Bartonella spp. across small mammal and ectoparasite communities.

We observed substantial overlap among small mammal communities in different habitat types, predominantly driven by habitat generalists. Most ectoparasites were generalists, infecting multiple hosts, and several host species displayed polyparasitism, i.e., they were infected by multiple ectoparasites. We observed high Bartonella prevalence at both study sites - a forest-plantation mosaic (47.4%) and a protected area (28.8%). Seven of the ten ectoparasite morphotypes sampled were also positive for Bartonella, following the prevalence trend in their hosts. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) revealed an independent association between aggregated ectoparasite load in species and Bartonella prevalence, implicating ectoparasites in transmission. Bartonella lineages from small mammals were host-specific, while ectoparasites showed no host-specific associations. They carried Bartonella associated with other hosts, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral trait reconstruction of Bartonella haplotypes suggests historic spillover events in the small mammal community, validating the potential for contemporary spillover. These results highlight infection risk from such underdiagnosed agents in the landscape, and the necessity to disentangle complex multi-host multi-vector systems to understand their epidemiological consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.</p>
