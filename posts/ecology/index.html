The overkill hypothesis asserts that the first New Zealand settlers hunted the Moa to extinction by circa 1450 CE, whereas the staggered survival hypothesis allows for Moa survival until after Europeans began to arrive on New Zealand. Alleged Moa sightings post-1450 CE may shed light on these competing hypotheses. A dataset of 97 alleged Moa sightings from circa 1675 CE to 1993 CE was constructed, with sightings given subjective quality ratings corresponding to various statistical probabilities. Cumulative probabilities of Moa persistence were calculated with a conservative survival model using these probabilistic sighting-records; a method recently applied to sightings of the Thylacine. Cumulative persistence probability fell sharply after 1408 CE, and across pessimistic and optimistic variations of the model, it was more likely than not that the Moa were extinct by 1770 CE. Probabilistic sighting-record models favour the overkill hypothesis, and give very low probabilities of Moa persistence around the time of European arrival. Eyewitness data on Moa sightings are amenable to scientific study, and these methods may be applied to similar animals.\nA tale of two springs: contrasting forest soundscapes during the COVID-19 lockdown (2020) and after the record snowstorm Filomena (2021) from Central Spain\nAuthors: Ortiz-Alvarez, R.; Leiva-Duenas, C.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560514\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity temporarily retired from the outdoors. The strict lockdown measures in Spain coincided with the onset of the nesting season of birds, thriving in an unusually quiet environment. Here, we have recorded in forests near San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Central Spain) during the lockdown period in 2020, and the closer to normal spring in 2021. We found strong differences in soundscapes by recording year and location, regardless of the effects of meteorology and human mobility. Species altered their behaviour by increasing their calling intensity during 2021 to cope with higher noise levels, however, acoustic activity was generally less diverse and complex. The difference between years was particularly detrimental for the highest-pitched biophony in 2021. We interpret that an extreme snowfall, Filomena, may have caused a mortality event with lasting effects in the community during the 2021 spring. Since extreme climatic events are likely going to keep happening in the area due to climate change, our data is a useful baseline to guide future conservation efforts, and examine how our activity and climate change are changing the soundscapes of Spanish Mediterranean forests.\nCross-sector collaboration reduces SARS-CoV-2 risk in deer\nAuthors: Cook, J. D.; Rosenblatt, E.; DiRenzo, G. V.; Campbell Grant, E. H.; Mosher, B.; Arce, F.; Christensen, S.; Ghai, R.; Runge, M.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562192\nOne Health helps achieve optimal health outcomes for people, animals, plants, and their shared environments. We describe a multidisciplinary effort to better understand and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread in white-tailed deer across One Health sectors. We first framed the risk problem with three governance sectors that manage captive and wild deer and human public health. The framing included the objectives for each sector, interactions that facilitate human-to-deer and deer-to-deer transmission, and alternatives intended to reduce risk. We then developed a dynamic compartmental model that linked wild and captive deer herds and humans and simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. For baseline conditions, we estimated that median SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wild and captive herds varied between 0.03 - 0.07, incidence between 0.68 - 1.46, and probability of persistence between 0.64 - 0.97 across 120-day simulations. We then tested single-sector alternatives alone and in combination with other sector actions. We found that single sector alternatives varied in their ability to reduce transmission and that the best performing alternative required collaborative actions among wildlife management, agricultural management, and public health agencies.\nEcological and Evolutionary Characteristics of Anthropogenic Roosting Ability in Bats of the World\nAuthors: Betke, B. A.; Gottdenker, N. L.; Meyers, L. A.; Becker, D. J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562433\nAlthough the global conversion of wildlife habitat to built environments often has negative impacts on biodiversity, some wildlife have the ability to cope by living in human-made structures. However, the determinants of this adaptation on a global scale are not well understood and may signify species with unique conservation needs at the human-wildlife interface. Here, we identify the trait profile associated with anthropogenic roosting in bats globally and characterize the evolution of this phenotype using an original dataset of roosting behavior developed across 1,279 extant species. Trait-based analyses showed that anthropogenic roosting is predictable across bats and is associated with habitat generalism, small geographic ranges, small body size, temperate zone distributions, and insectivory. We identified moderate phylogenetic signal in this complex phenotype, which has undergone both gains and losses across bat evolution and for which speciation rates are lower compared to natural roosting bats.\nDiet and chemical defenses of the Sonoran Desert toads\nAuthors: Luccioni, M. D.; Wyman, J. T.; O'Connell, L. A.; Espinoza, E.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561297\nThe Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.\nNew Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Marine Image Analysis\nAuthors: Clark, H. P.; Smith, A. G.; McKay Fletcher, D.; Larsson, A. I.; Jaspars, M.; De Clippele, L. H.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562046\nDue to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {+/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.\nEmergent Ecological Patterns and Modelling of Gut Microbiomes in Health and in Disease\nAuthors: Pasqualini, J.; Facchin, S.; Rinaldo, A.; Maritan, A.; Savarino, E.; Suweis, S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563037\nThe Human Gut Microbiome (HGM) harbors a huge diversity in terms of species. Recent work has shown the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities using 16s OTU data. Here we investigate whether such patterns could be used to discriminate between different models of population dynamics, and characterize gut microbiomes in healthy vs. disease states. In this work, by using shotgun metagenomics data, we first discuss how a simple scaling relation (Taylor's law) plays a crucial role when building theoretical models for the gut microbiome. Moving from recent results, we then introduce the Symmetric Schlomlich Model, which is related to a widely used prior for relative species abundance (RSA), i.e. the Dirichlet Model. We show that the RSA can be obtained by constraining the solution of the Stochastic Logistic Growth Model, thus endowing all parameters with a clear ecological interpretation. Finally, we characterize the gut microbiomes from an ecological viewpoint, and compare how different models describe the emergent gut microbiome patterns in healthy and disease conditions.\nFrom disturbances to nonlinear fitness and back.\nAuthors: Tuljapurkar, S. D.; Jaggi, H.; Gascoigne, S. J. L.; Zuo, W.; Kajin, M.; Salguero-Gomez, R.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563360\nA fundamental goal of Ecology is to predict how natural populations respond to disturbances. Accordingly, the last decades have witnessed key theoretical developments in stochastic demography and transient dynamics. However, both areas, have to date been largely disconnected. Here, we introduce an expression for the second derivatives of population growth rate with respect to demographic rates (e.g. survival-dependent state transitions and reproduction) with direct links to transient dynamics. We use this connection to develop a new mathematical framework showing how transient responses to pulse disturbances lead to a quantitative description of press disturbances. Second-derivatives of population growth rate with respect to said demographic rates are valuable as they quantify the degree of non-linear selection acting on demographic rates and how environments shape the long-term performance of populations. Whilst valuable, previous methods to quantify second-order derivatives have heavily relied on vector calculus- potentially obscuring important demographic processes connected to second-order derivatives. Here we offer an intuitive method using perturbation theory and our approach is valid for any discrete-time, st(age)-based structured population model. Importantly, our new method implicates an intimate relationship between the non-linear selection pressures acting on demographic rates with the emergent transient dynamics of populations over time. We showcase these relationships through mathematical proofs, connecting to Cohen's cumulative distance, and identifying a strong relationship between generation time across 439 unique plant and animal species (2690 population models). As such, this new method represents a valuable tool for population ecologists, comparative demographers, and conservation biologists to understand and protect structured populations in a changing world.\nEvidence of spatial regime shifts: contrasting spatial dynamics of three Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the North Sea.\nAuthors: Cecapolli, E.; Romagnoni, G.; Bloecker, A.; Moellmann, C.; Sguotti, C.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562168\nRecent scientific assessments have started to consider the presence of multiple populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea due to genetic evidence. The Atlantic cod stock as a whole has experienced a regime shift in the North Sea and is now considered to be in a persistent depleted state. Here we investigated if the regime shift detected for North Sea cod manifested differently across areas (South, North-West and Viking (North-East)), revealing different dynamics and recovery potential for the corresponding populations. Methods from change point analyses to stochastic cusp models were applied to detect the regime shifts. We found that cod in the Southern North Sea has undergone a regime shift and is now in a persistent depleted state. The Viking population is in a low state but with high resilience, making its dynamics more predictable and thus easier to manage. Finally, the north-western population did not show signs of a regime shift and is in a high biomass level. Several abiotic and biotic drivers (e.g. fishing, warming) contribute to these differences. Our study provides useful information for the restructuring of management units of cod in the North Sea and highlights the importance of looking at regime shifts spatially.\nAnophelesModel: An R package to interface mosquito bionomics, human exposure and intervention effects with models of malaria intervention impact\nAuthors: Golumbeanu, M.; Briët, O.; Champagne, C.; Lemant, J.; Winkel, M.; Zogo, B.; Gerhards, M.; Sinka, M.; Chitnis, N.; Penny, M.; Pothin, E.; Smith, T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562838\nIn recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access, R package that directly allows incorporating generated entomological data for adjustment of models to assess intervention scenarios according to species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 Anopheles species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and on estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The Moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) are an extinct group of the ratite clade from New Zealand. The overkill hypothesis asserts that the first New Zealand settlers hunted the Moa to extinction by circa 1450 CE, whereas the staggered survival hypothesis allows for Moa survival until after Europeans began to arrive on New Zealand. Alleged Moa sightings post-1450 CE may shed light on these competing hypotheses. A dataset of 97 alleged Moa sightings from circa 1675 CE to 1993 CE was constructed, with sightings given subjective quality ratings corresponding to various statistical probabilities. Cumulative probabilities of Moa persistence were calculated with a conservative survival model using these probabilistic sighting-records; a method recently applied to sightings of the Thylacine. Cumulative persistence probability fell sharply after 1408 CE, and across pessimistic and optimistic variations of the model, it was more likely than not that the Moa were extinct by 1770 CE. Probabilistic sighting-record models favour the overkill hypothesis, and give very low probabilities of Moa persistence around the time of European arrival. Eyewitness data on Moa sightings are amenable to scientific study, and these methods may be applied to similar animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity temporarily retired from the outdoors. The strict lockdown measures in Spain coincided with the onset of the nesting season of birds, thriving in an unusually quiet environment. Here, we have recorded in forests near San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Central Spain) during the lockdown period in 2020, and the closer to normal spring in 2021. We found strong differences in soundscapes by recording year and location, regardless of the effects of meteorology and human mobility. Species altered their behaviour by increasing their calling intensity during 2021 to cope with higher noise levels, however, acoustic activity was generally less diverse and complex. The difference between years was particularly detrimental for the highest-pitched biophony in 2021. We interpret that an extreme snowfall, Filomena, may have caused a mortality event with lasting effects in the community during the 2021 spring. Since extreme climatic events are likely going to keep happening in the area due to climate change, our data is a useful baseline to guide future conservation efforts, and examine how our activity and climate change are changing the soundscapes of Spanish Mediterranean forests.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One Health helps achieve optimal health outcomes for people, animals, plants, and their shared environments. We describe a multidisciplinary effort to better understand and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread in white-tailed deer across One Health sectors. We first framed the risk problem with three governance sectors that manage captive and wild deer and human public health. The framing included the objectives for each sector, interactions that facilitate human-to-deer and deer-to-deer transmission, and alternatives intended to reduce risk. We then developed a dynamic compartmental model that linked wild and captive deer herds and humans and simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. For baseline conditions, we estimated that median SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wild and captive herds varied between 0.03 - 0.07, incidence between 0.68 - 1.46, and probability of persistence between 0.64 - 0.97 across 120-day simulations. We then tested single-sector alternatives alone and in combination with other sector actions. We found that single sector alternatives varied in their ability to reduce transmission and that the best performing alternative required collaborative actions among wildlife management, agricultural management, and public health agencies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although the global conversion of wildlife habitat to built environments often has negative impacts on biodiversity, some wildlife have the ability to cope by living in human-made structures. However, the determinants of this adaptation on a global scale are not well understood and may signify species with unique conservation needs at the human-wildlife interface. Here, we identify the trait profile associated with anthropogenic roosting in bats globally and characterize the evolution of this phenotype using an original dataset of roosting behavior developed across 1,279 extant species. Trait-based analyses showed that anthropogenic roosting is predictable across bats and is associated with habitat generalism, small geographic ranges, small body size, temperate zone distributions, and insectivory. We identified moderate phylogenetic signal in this complex phenotype, which has undergone both gains and losses across bat evolution and for which speciation rates are lower compared to natural roosting bats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {&#43;/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Human Gut Microbiome (HGM) harbors a huge diversity in terms of species. Recent work has shown the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities using 16s OTU data. Here we investigate whether such patterns could be used to discriminate between different models of population dynamics, and characterize gut microbiomes in healthy vs. disease states. In this work, by using shotgun metagenomics data, we first discuss how a simple scaling relation (Taylor&#39;s law) plays a crucial role when building theoretical models for the gut microbiome. Moving from recent results, we then introduce the Symmetric Schlomlich Model, which is related to a widely used prior for relative species abundance (RSA), i.e. the Dirichlet Model. We show that the RSA can be obtained by constraining the solution of the Stochastic Logistic Growth Model, thus endowing all parameters with a clear ecological interpretation. Finally, we characterize the gut microbiomes from an ecological viewpoint, and compare how different models describe the emergent gut microbiome patterns in healthy and disease conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A fundamental goal of Ecology is to predict how natural populations respond to disturbances. Accordingly, the last decades have witnessed key theoretical developments in stochastic demography and transient dynamics. However, both areas, have to date been largely disconnected. Here, we introduce an expression for the second derivatives of population growth rate with respect to demographic rates (e.g. survival-dependent state transitions and reproduction) with direct links to transient dynamics. We use this connection to develop a new mathematical framework showing how transient responses to pulse disturbances lead to a quantitative description of press disturbances. Second-derivatives of population growth rate with respect to said demographic rates are valuable as they quantify the degree of non-linear selection acting on demographic rates and how environments shape the long-term performance of populations. Whilst valuable, previous methods to quantify second-order derivatives have heavily relied on vector calculus- potentially obscuring important demographic processes connected to second-order derivatives. Here we offer an intuitive method using perturbation theory and our approach is valid for any discrete-time, st(age)-based structured population model. Importantly, our new method implicates an intimate relationship between the non-linear selection pressures acting on demographic rates with the emergent transient dynamics of populations over time. We showcase these relationships through mathematical proofs, connecting to Cohen&#39;s cumulative distance, and identifying a strong relationship between generation time across 439 unique plant and animal species (2690 population models). As such, this new method represents a valuable tool for population ecologists, comparative demographers, and conservation biologists to understand and protect structured populations in a changing world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent scientific assessments have started to consider the presence of multiple populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea due to genetic evidence. The Atlantic cod stock as a whole has experienced a regime shift in the North Sea and is now considered to be in a persistent depleted state. Here we investigated if the regime shift detected for North Sea cod manifested differently across areas (South, North-West and Viking (North-East)), revealing different dynamics and recovery potential for the corresponding populations. Methods from change point analyses to stochastic cusp models were applied to detect the regime shifts. We found that cod in the Southern North Sea has undergone a regime shift and is now in a persistent depleted state. The Viking population is in a low state but with high resilience, making its dynamics more predictable and thus easier to manage. Finally, the north-western population did not show signs of a regime shift and is in a high biomass level. Several abiotic and biotic drivers (e.g. fishing, warming) contribute to these differences. Our study provides useful information for the restructuring of management units of cod in the North Sea and highlights the importance of looking at regime shifts spatially.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access, R package that directly allows incorporating generated entomological data for adjustment of models to assess intervention scenarios according to species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 Anopheles species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and on estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.</p>
