A.; Espinoza, E.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561297\nThe Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.\nNew Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Marine Image Analysis\nAuthors: Clark, H. P.; Smith, A. G.; McKay Fletcher, D.; Larsson, A. I.; Jaspars, M.; De Clippele, L. H.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562046\nDue to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {+/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.\nSentinels for future coral reef conditions: assessment of environmental variability and water quality in semi-enclosed inland bays in the southern Caribbean\nAuthors: de Jong, C.; van Os, I.; Sepulveda-Rodriguez, G.; de Baat, M. L.; Schoepf, V.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560694\nThe mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and \u003e20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Curacao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Curacaos inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.\nTowards quantitative DNA Metabarcoding: A method to overcome PCR amplification bias\nAuthors: Moinard, S.; Piau, D.; Laporte, F.; Rioux, D.; Taberlet, P.; Gonindard-Melodelima, C.; Coissac, E.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560640\nMetabarcoding analyses have recently undergone significant development due to the power of this technique in biodiversity monitoring. However, it is still difficult to draw accurate quantitative conclusions about the ecosystems studied, mainly because of biases inherent in the environmental DNA or introduced during the experimental process. These biases alter the relationship between the amount of DNA observed and the biomass or number of individuals of the species detected. Two of the biases inherent in metabarcoding have been measured: the ratio between total DNA and target DNA concentrations, and the PCR amplification bias. A method for their correction is proposed. All experimental tests were performed on mock alpine plant communities using the marker Sper01, which is expected to have low amplification bias due to its highly conserved priming sites. Our approach combines standard quantitative PCR techniques (qPCR and digital droplet PCR) with a realistic stochastic model of PCR dynamics that accounts for PCR saturation. The model was used to estimate PCR efficiencies for each species and to infer the true species proportions of the mock communities from the read relative frequencies. The corrections are easy to implement and can be applied to previously generated DNA metabarcoding data. This work demonstrates the relative importance of the two biases considered and is an open door to quantitative metabarcoding data, although many other biases remain to be considered.\nIntraspecific plant-soil feedbacks vary under field conditions among species in a tropical tree community\nAuthors: Eck, J. L.; Hernandez Hassan, L.; Comita, L. S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561486\nPremiseSoil microbes can influence patterns of diversity in plant communities via plant-soil feedbacks. Intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur when plant genotype causes variation in soil microbial composition, resulting in differences in the performance of seedlings growing near their maternal plants versus seedlings growing near non-maternal conspecific plants. How commonly such intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur in natural plant communities is unclear, especially under variable field conditions. MethodsWe conducted an in situ experiment with four native tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Seedlings of each species were transplanted beneath their maternal tree or another conspecific tree in the BCI forest. Mortality and growth were assessed at the end of the wet season ([~]4 months post-transplant) and at the end of the experiment ([~]7 months post-transplant). ResultsPatterns of seedling performance varied among species and were inconsistent over time. Significant effects of field environment were detected for two of the four species: at the end of the wet season, Virola surinamensis seedlings had higher survival beneath their maternal tree than other conspecific trees, while the opposite pattern was found in Ormosia macrocalyx. However, these differences disappeared by the end of the experiment. ConclusionsOur results suggest that intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur inconsistently under field conditions in tropical tree species and may have a limited role in determining seedling performance in tropical tree communities. Future studies are needed to elucidate the environmental and genetic factors that determine the incidence and direction of intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks in plant communities.\nReciprocal interactions between the sorghum root microbiome and the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica\nAuthors: Etalo, D. W.; Rybka, D.; Lombard, L.; Leite, M. F. A.; Ossowicki, A.; Dini-Andreote, F.; Arias-Giraldo, L.; Kuramae, E. E.; Crous, P. W.; Tessema, T.; Raaijmakers, J. M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560362\nThe soil microbiome plays a crucial role in protecting plants against various pests and pathogens. However, its impact on interactions between plants and parasitic weeds, such as Striga hermonthica, is poorly understood. In this study, sorghum plants susceptible to Striga were grown in 22 different field soils infested with parasite seeds. Significant variations in Striga infections were observed among the soils. When the most Striga-suppressive soil was gamma-irradiated, there was a significant increase in Striga attachments, highlighting the importance of the soil microbiome in disrupting parasite infection. In the presence of the soil microbiome, the Striga-susceptible sorghum plants performed similarly to three Striga-resistant genotypes. This effect was lost when the soil microbiome was eliminated by gamma-irradiation. Subsequent analysis revealed that Striga substantially affected the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome and that both the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome and bacteriome composition significantly correlated with Striga attachment. Interestingly, certain fungal species in the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome were only detected when Striga seeds were present. Further investigation showed that these fungal taxa originated from the Striga seeds and are known sorghum pathogens, suggesting a potential partnership between Striga and fungal pathogens to invade their shared host. Overall, our study demonstrated that the soil microbiome influences Striga infection and sorghum performance in a genotype-dependent manner, and the microbiome of Striga seeds affects the composition of the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome.\nExtraordinary levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in vertebrate animals at a New Mexico desert oasis: multiple pathways for wildlife and human exposure\nAuthors: Witt, C. C.; Gadek, C. R.; Cartron, J.-L. E.; Andersen, M. J.; Campbell, M. L.; Castro-Farias, M.; Gyllenhaal, E. F.; Johnson, A. B.; Malaney, J. L.; Montoya, K. N.; Patterson, A.; Vinciguerra, N. T.; Williamson, J. L.; Cook, J. A.; Dunnum, J. L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561778\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) threaten human and wildlife health, but their movement through food webs remains poorly understood. Contamination of the physical environment is widespread, but particularly concentrated at military installations. Here we measured 17 PFAS in wild, free-living mammals and migratory birds at Holloman Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico, USA, where wastewater catchment lakes form biodiverse oases. PFAS concentrations were among the highest ever reported in animal tissues, and high levels have persisted for at least three decades. The hazardous long carbon-chain form, perfluorooctanosulfonic acid (PFOS), was most abundant, with liver concentrations averaging tens of thousands of ng/g wet weight (ww), reaching as high 97,000 ng/g (ww) in a 1994 specimen of white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and 38,000 ng/g ww in a duck, the American wigeon (Mareca americana). Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) averaged thousands of ng/g ww in the livers of birds and house mice, but one order of magnitude lower in the livers of upland desert rodent species. PFAS levels were strikingly lower at control sites, even for highly mobile migratory species. Tissue concentrations were correlated within individuals, and consistently higher in liver than in muscle or blood. Twenty of 23 vertebrate species sampled at Holloman AFB were heavily contaminated, representing multiple trophic levels and microhabitats, and implicating a range of pathways for PFAS spread: ingestion of surface water, sediments, and dust; foraging on aquatic invertebrates and plants by secondary consumers; and preying upon small vertebrates by higher level consumers, including consumption of game species by hunters. Unlike in other aquatic systems, piscivory was not an important pathway of PFAS uptake. In sum, legacy PFAS at a desert wetland have permeated the local food web across a period of decades, severely contaminating resident and migrant animals, and likely exposing humans via game meat consumption and outdoor recreation.\nViromes vs. mixed community metagenomes: choice of method dictates interpretation of viral community ecology\nAuthors: Kosmopoulos, J. C.; Klier, K. M.; Langwig, M. V.; Tran, P. Q.; Anantharaman, K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562385\nViruses, the majority of which are uncultivated, are among the most abundant biological entities in microbiomes and ecosystems on Earth. From selfishly altering community-wide microbial physiology to driving microbiome dynamics, viruses (particularly bacteriophage) are fundamental members of microbiomes. While the number of studies leveraging viral metagenomics (viromics) for studying uncultivated viruses is growing, standards for viromics research are lacking. Viromics can leverage computational discovery of viruses from total metagenomes of all community members (hereafter metagenomes) or use physical separation of virus-specific fractions (hereafter viromes). However, differences in the recovery and interpretation of viruses from metagenomes and viromes obtained from the same samples remains understudied. Here, we compare viral communities from paired viromes and metagenomes obtained from 51 diverse samples across human gut, soil, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Overall, viral communities obtained from viromes were more abundant and species rich than those obtained from metagenomes, although there were some exceptions. Despite this, metagenomes still contained many viral genomes not detected in viromes. We also found notable differences in the predicted lytic state of viruses detected in viromes vs metagenomes at the time of sequencing. Other forms of variation observed include genome presence/absence, genome quality, and encoded protein content between viromes and metagenomes, but the magnitude of these differences varied by environment. Overall, our results here show that choice of method can lead to differing interpretations of viral community ecology. We suggest that the choice of whether to target a metagenome or virome should be dependent on the environmental context and ecological questions being asked. However, our overall recommendation to researchers investigating viral ecology and evolution is to pair both approaches to maximize their respective benefits.\nA hitchhiker's guide to Europe: mapping human-mediated dispersal of the invasive Japanese beetle\nAuthors: Borner, L.; Martinetti, D.; Poggi, S.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561184\nEarly detection of hitchhiking pests requires the identification of strategic entry points via transport. We propose a framework for achieving this in Europe using the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) as a case study. Human-mediated dispersal has been responsible for its introduction into several continents over the last century, including Europe where it is listed as a priority pest. Furthermore, interceptions far from the infested area confirm the risk of unintentional transport within continental Europe. Here, we analyse how three modes of transport - air, rail and road - connect the infested area to the rest of Europe. We ranked all European regions from most to least reachable from the infested area. We identified border regions and distant major cities that are readily reachable and observed differences between modes. We propose a composite reachability index combining the three modes, which provides a valuable tool for designing a continental surveillance strategy and prioritising highly reachable regions, as demonstrated by recent interceptions. Significance statementSpecies can be moved long distances by unintentional human transport. Such events can lead to their introduction into non-native areas where they can cause biological invasions. Using the case study of the Japanese beetle, a hitchhiker invasive insect, we propose a framework for identifying entry points for human-transported pests within Europe. We consider how the European infested area is connected to the rest of the continent by three modes of transport: air, rail and road. We propose a methodology that considers the three modes to identify potential entry points. This framework could assist authorities in designing surveillance strategies to achieve early detection of pests in Europe.\nToxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma lewisi infection in urban small mammals from Cotonou, Benin, with special emphasis on co-infection patterns\nAuthors: ETOUGBETCHE, J. R.; HOUEMENOU, G.; Missihoun, A. A.; Gauthier, P.; Dossou, H.-J.; Galal, L.; Dalecky, A.; Diagne, C.; Dobigny, G.; MERCIER, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.558972\nA growing number of studies has highlighted the importance of co-infections in eco-evolutionary processes underlying host-parasite interactions and the resulting epidemiology of zoonotic agents. Small mammals, and particularly rodents, are known to be important reservoirs of many zoonotic pathogens, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma lewisi that are responsible for toxoplasmosis and atypical trypanosomiasis in human, respectively. Laboratory experiments on rodent models have shown that primary infection with T. lewisi increases the host susceptibility to other co-infectious parasites, including T. gondii, following an alteration of the immune system. However, data on potential interactions between these parasites in wild small mammals remain scarce. In this study, we estimate the T. lewisi prevalence in 553 small mammals from four localities of Cotonou city, Benin. They were then combined with T. gondii data previously collected on the same individuals in order to investigate the influence of T. lewisi on T. gondii infection, and vice-versa, using cooccurrence tests and Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Despite quite high overall prevalence (32.5% and 15.2% for T. gondii and T. lewisi, respectively), we observed a clear and significant segregation between the two parasites. This may be explained by (i) differences in the species-specific susceptibility of small mammal host species to infection by these two parasites, with R. rattus and M. natalensis being the main reservoirs of T. lewisi while C. olivieri and M. m. domesticus are the main hosts for T. gondii; and/or by (ii) a possibly high mortality in co-infected animal in the wild. Although dedicated experimental studies are required to confirm this pattern, as they stand, our data fail to support that infection of small mammals by one of these two parasites favours widespread infection by the second one in nature.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {&#43;/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and &gt;20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Curacao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Curacaos inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabarcoding analyses have recently undergone significant development due to the power of this technique in biodiversity monitoring. However, it is still difficult to draw accurate quantitative conclusions about the ecosystems studied, mainly because of biases inherent in the environmental DNA or introduced during the experimental process. These biases alter the relationship between the amount of DNA observed and the biomass or number of individuals of the species detected. Two of the biases inherent in metabarcoding have been measured: the ratio between total DNA and target DNA concentrations, and the PCR amplification bias. A method for their correction is proposed. All experimental tests were performed on mock alpine plant communities using the marker Sper01, which is expected to have low amplification bias due to its highly conserved priming sites. Our approach combines standard quantitative PCR techniques (qPCR and digital droplet PCR) with a realistic stochastic model of PCR dynamics that accounts for PCR saturation. The model was used to estimate PCR efficiencies for each species and to infer the true species proportions of the mock communities from the read relative frequencies. The corrections are easy to implement and can be applied to previously generated DNA metabarcoding data. This work demonstrates the relative importance of the two biases considered and is an open door to quantitative metabarcoding data, although many other biases remain to be considered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PremiseSoil microbes can influence patterns of diversity in plant communities via plant-soil feedbacks. Intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur when plant genotype causes variation in soil microbial composition, resulting in differences in the performance of seedlings growing near their maternal plants versus seedlings growing near non-maternal conspecific plants. How commonly such intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur in natural plant communities is unclear, especially under variable field conditions.

MethodsWe conducted an in situ experiment with four native tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Seedlings of each species were transplanted beneath their maternal tree or another conspecific tree in the BCI forest. Mortality and growth were assessed at the end of the wet season ([~]4 months post-transplant) and at the end of the experiment ([~]7 months post-transplant).

ResultsPatterns of seedling performance varied among species and were inconsistent over time. Significant effects of field environment were detected for two of the four species: at the end of the wet season, Virola surinamensis seedlings had higher survival beneath their maternal tree than other conspecific trees, while the opposite pattern was found in Ormosia macrocalyx. However, these differences disappeared by the end of the experiment.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur inconsistently under field conditions in tropical tree species and may have a limited role in determining seedling performance in tropical tree communities. Future studies are needed to elucidate the environmental and genetic factors that determine the incidence and direction of intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks in plant communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The soil microbiome plays a crucial role in protecting plants against various pests and pathogens. However, its impact on interactions between plants and parasitic weeds, such as Striga hermonthica, is poorly understood. In this study, sorghum plants susceptible to Striga were grown in 22 different field soils infested with parasite seeds. Significant variations in Striga infections were observed among the soils. When the most Striga-suppressive soil was gamma-irradiated, there was a significant increase in Striga attachments, highlighting the importance of the soil microbiome in disrupting parasite infection. In the presence of the soil microbiome, the Striga-susceptible sorghum plants performed similarly to three Striga-resistant genotypes. This effect was lost when the soil microbiome was eliminated by gamma-irradiation. Subsequent analysis revealed that Striga substantially affected the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome and that both the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome and bacteriome composition significantly correlated with Striga attachment. Interestingly, certain fungal species in the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome were only detected when Striga seeds were present. Further investigation showed that these fungal taxa originated from the Striga seeds and are known sorghum pathogens, suggesting a potential partnership between Striga and fungal pathogens to invade their shared host. Overall, our study demonstrated that the soil microbiome influences Striga infection and sorghum performance in a genotype-dependent manner, and the microbiome of Striga seeds affects the composition of the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) threaten human and wildlife health, but their movement through food webs remains poorly understood. Contamination of the physical environment is widespread, but particularly concentrated at military installations. Here we measured 17 PFAS in wild, free-living mammals and migratory birds at Holloman Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico, USA, where wastewater catchment lakes form biodiverse oases. PFAS concentrations were among the highest ever reported in animal tissues, and high levels have persisted for at least three decades. The hazardous long carbon-chain form, perfluorooctanosulfonic acid (PFOS), was most abundant, with liver concentrations averaging tens of thousands of ng/g wet weight (ww), reaching as high 97,000 ng/g (ww) in a 1994 specimen of white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and 38,000 ng/g ww in a duck, the American wigeon (Mareca americana). Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) averaged thousands of ng/g ww in the livers of birds and house mice, but one order of magnitude lower in the livers of upland desert rodent species. PFAS levels were strikingly lower at control sites, even for highly mobile migratory species. Tissue concentrations were correlated within individuals, and consistently higher in liver than in muscle or blood. Twenty of 23 vertebrate species sampled at Holloman AFB were heavily contaminated, representing multiple trophic levels and microhabitats, and implicating a range of pathways for PFAS spread: ingestion of surface water, sediments, and dust; foraging on aquatic invertebrates and plants by secondary consumers; and preying upon small vertebrates by higher level consumers, including consumption of game species by hunters. Unlike in other aquatic systems, piscivory was not an important pathway of PFAS uptake. In sum, legacy PFAS at a desert wetland have permeated the local food web across a period of decades, severely contaminating resident and migrant animals, and likely exposing humans via game meat consumption and outdoor recreation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viruses, the majority of which are uncultivated, are among the most abundant biological entities in microbiomes and ecosystems on Earth. From selfishly altering community-wide microbial physiology to driving microbiome dynamics, viruses (particularly bacteriophage) are fundamental members of microbiomes. While the number of studies leveraging viral metagenomics (viromics) for studying uncultivated viruses is growing, standards for viromics research are lacking. Viromics can leverage computational discovery of viruses from total metagenomes of all community members (hereafter metagenomes) or use physical separation of virus-specific fractions (hereafter viromes). However, differences in the recovery and interpretation of viruses from metagenomes and viromes obtained from the same samples remains understudied. Here, we compare viral communities from paired viromes and metagenomes obtained from 51 diverse samples across human gut, soil, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Overall, viral communities obtained from viromes were more abundant and species rich than those obtained from metagenomes, although there were some exceptions. Despite this, metagenomes still contained many viral genomes not detected in viromes. We also found notable differences in the predicted lytic state of viruses detected in viromes vs metagenomes at the time of sequencing. Other forms of variation observed include genome presence/absence, genome quality, and encoded protein content between viromes and metagenomes, but the magnitude of these differences varied by environment. Overall, our results here show that choice of method can lead to differing interpretations of viral community ecology. We suggest that the choice of whether to target a metagenome or virome should be dependent on the environmental context and ecological questions being asked. However, our overall recommendation to researchers investigating viral ecology and evolution is to pair both approaches to maximize their respective benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early detection of hitchhiking pests requires the identification of strategic entry points via transport. We propose a framework for achieving this in Europe using the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) as a case study. Human-mediated dispersal has been responsible for its introduction into several continents over the last century, including Europe where it is listed as a priority pest. Furthermore, interceptions far from the infested area confirm the risk of unintentional transport within continental Europe. Here, we analyse how three modes of transport - air, rail and road - connect the infested area to the rest of Europe. We ranked all European regions from most to least reachable from the infested area. We identified border regions and distant major cities that are readily reachable and observed differences between modes. We propose a composite reachability index combining the three modes, which provides a valuable tool for designing a continental surveillance strategy and prioritising highly reachable regions, as demonstrated by recent interceptions.

Significance statementSpecies can be moved long distances by unintentional human transport. Such events can lead to their introduction into non-native areas where they can cause biological invasions. Using the case study of the Japanese beetle, a hitchhiker invasive insect, we propose a framework for identifying entry points for human-transported pests within Europe. We consider how the European infested area is connected to the rest of the continent by three modes of transport: air, rail and road. We propose a methodology that considers the three modes to identify potential entry points. This framework could assist authorities in designing surveillance strategies to achieve early detection of pests in Europe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A growing number of studies has highlighted the importance of co-infections in eco-evolutionary processes underlying host-parasite interactions and the resulting epidemiology of zoonotic agents. Small mammals, and particularly rodents, are known to be important reservoirs of many zoonotic pathogens, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma lewisi that are responsible for toxoplasmosis and atypical trypanosomiasis in human, respectively. Laboratory experiments on rodent models have shown that primary infection with T. lewisi increases the host susceptibility to other co-infectious parasites, including T. gondii, following an alteration of the immune system. However, data on potential interactions between these parasites in wild small mammals remain scarce. In this study, we estimate the T. lewisi prevalence in 553 small mammals from four localities of Cotonou city, Benin. They were then combined with T. gondii data previously collected on the same individuals in order to investigate the influence of T. lewisi on T. gondii infection, and vice-versa, using cooccurrence tests and Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Despite quite high overall prevalence (32.5% and 15.2% for T. gondii and T. lewisi, respectively), we observed a clear and significant segregation between the two parasites. This may be explained by (i) differences in the species-specific susceptibility of small mammal host species to infection by these two parasites, with R. rattus and M. natalensis being the main reservoirs of T. lewisi while C. olivieri and M. m. domesticus are the main hosts for T. gondii; and/or by (ii) a possibly high mortality in co-infected animal in the wild. Although dedicated experimental studies are required to confirm this pattern, as they stand, our data fail to support that infection of small mammals by one of these two parasites favours widespread infection by the second one in nature.</p>
