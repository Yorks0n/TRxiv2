These gaps are particularly wide in mountain regions where healthy soils are especially important for human safety and yet evidence is accumulating of ongoing degradation, posing significant threats to ecosystem functioning and human settlements. To analyse these gaps in detail, we synthesise current research on the global diversity of microorganisms, cryptogams, and invertebrates in mountain soils above the treeline. This synthesis is based on a semi-quantitative survey of the literature and an expert-based analysis. Our work reveals not only deficiencies in geographic cover but also significant gaps in taxonomic coverage, particularly among soil protists and invertebrates, and a lack of (functional and ecological) description of the uncultivated majority of prokaryotes, fungi, and protists. We subsequently build on this overview to highlight opportunities for research on mountain soils as systems of co-occurring species that interact in complex environmental matrices to fulfil critical functions and make essential contributions to life on land. Closing gaps in biodiversity research in mountain soil is crucial to enhance our understanding and to promote laws and guidelines advancing international soil biodiversity conservation targets in mountains. Addressing sparse and biased data, recognizing the impact of environmental changes on mountain ecosystems, and advocating dedicated policies are essential strategies to safeguard mountain soils and their biodiversity.

P.; Beger, M.; Carr, I. M.; Taylor, M.; Valsecchi, E.; Goodman, S. J.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572838\nMarine mammal foraging grounds are popular focal points for marine protected area (MPA) implementation, but may be temporally dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring to infer prey availability and abundance. Marine mammal distributions are assumed to be driven by their prey in foraging areas, but limited understanding of prey distributions often prevents us from exploring how shifting prey availability impacts both seasonal and long-term marine mammal distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding could enhance understanding of marine mammal habitat use in relation to their prey through simultaneous monitoring of both. However, eDNA applications focused on marine mammals or predator-prey dynamics have been limited to date. In this study, we assess spatiotemporal changes in the availability and abundance of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) prey species in a newly established MPA, employing eDNA metabarcoding. We recovered 105 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from marine vertebrates using two primer sets targeting 12S and 16S genes, along with 112 OTUs from a broader eukaryotic primer set targeting 18S rRNA. Overall, key forage fish prey species, sandeels and clupeids, were the most abundant teleost fishes detected, although their availability varied temporally and with distance from shore. We also found clear spatial partitioning between coastal bottlenose dolphins and the more pelagic minke whales and harbour porpoises, paralleling availability of their main prey species. Other species of conservation interest were also detected including the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), blue fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), and the invasive pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This study demonstrates the application of eDNA to detect spatiotemporal trends in the occurrence and abundance of cetacean predators and their prey, furthering our understanding of fine-scale habitat use within MPAs. Future, long-term monitoring of predator-prey dynamics with eDNA could improve our ability to predict climate-induced shifts in foraging grounds and enhance rapid responses with appropriate management actions.\nThe effects of phenotypic plasticity on diversification rates and adaptive evolution in simulated environments with different climatic and cost contexts\nAuthors: Barbosa Junior, E. C.; Dodonov, P.; Japyassu, H.; Vilela, B.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573714\nPhenotypic plasticity can either hinder or facilitate genetic evolution, thus affecting macroevolution. However, the mechanisms and associations of phenotypic plasticity with biodiversity patterns remain unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phenotypic plasticity on adaptive evolution in the context of climatic changes and plasticity costs, specifically examining the rates of trait evolution, speciation, extinction, and diversification. We employed an eco-evolutionary agent-based model, incorporating body temperature as a plastic trait that dynamically responds to fluctuations in environmental temperature. We found the same pattern of results for both climate and plasticity cost contexts. We found that an increase in plasticity leads to a decrease in extinction and trait evolution rates, with high plasticity serving to postpone mass extinction events. Systems with plastic species experience higher speciation rates. Additionally, as plasticity increases in systems, diversification rates also increase. Our study supports the hypothesis that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. It provides new insights into the effect of plasticity on adaptive evolution at larger scales, considering relevant mechanisms and factors such as population size, grouping, occupancy, plasticity extension, and dispersion.\nIndirect effects of habitat amount mediated by habitat configuration determine bat diversity at the landscape-scale in Peninsular Malaysia\nAuthors: Hazard, Q. C. K.; Yoh, N.; Moore, J.; Senawi, J.; Gibson, L.; Froidevaux, J. S. P.; Palmeirim, A. F.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573737\nThe impacts of fragmentation are often overlooked in landscape studies investigating how habitat loss impacts biodiversity, despite the casual relationship linking both processes. As habitat loss is the primary cause of fragmentation, understanding the inter-related effects of these twin processes on biodiversity is key to minimise biodiversity loss. Here we assess how habitat amount and configuration influence insectivorous bat assemblages, considering both the direct effects of these processes, as well as the indirect effects of habitat amount mediated through configuration. Bats were acoustically surveyed along independent gradients of habitat amount (forest cover) and configuration (number of patches and edge density) across 28 insular landscapes embedded within a Malaysian hydroelectric reservoir. Using Structural Equation Modelling, the direct and indirect effects of habitat amount were examined on bat sonotype richness, total, and guild-specific activity (forest, edge and open-space foragers). Forest cover had a direct and positive effect on sonotype richness and forest forager activity. The quadratic relationship linking edge density and forest cover was strong and overall positive, but while below 30% of forest cover, increasingly forested landscapes had increasingly high edge densities, the opposite pattern was observed in more forested landscapes. On the other hand, increasingly forested landscapes consistently harboured less patches. Owing to the overall low habitat amount in our landscapes and negative edge effects, the indirect effects of forest cover (mediated through edge density) were therefore negative on sonotype richness, outweighing any positive direct effect. The number of patches had little effect on the bat assemblage, except on total activity which was higher in landscapes harbouring more forest patches. As a result, negative indirect effects of forest cover mediated through number of patches were only observed on total activity. Our results highlight that, in natural settings, habitat amount can hardly be altered without influencing habitat configuration, thereby preventing any independent management of these threats. Minimising habitat loss is therefore essential to balance the associated prevailing negative effects of fragmentation on insectivorous bats across tropical forests.\nComplex life cycles and parasite-mediated trophic cascades drive species coexistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity\nAuthors: Hijar-Islas, A. C.; Mon Pere, N. V.; Huang, W.; Eizaguirre, C.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.571902\nEcological and evolutionary processes shape the dynamics of interacting species, yet the drivers of eco-evolutionary feedback remain elusive. Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.\nWinners in good times and bad times: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria profit from photoheterotrophy under carbon-rich and poor conditions\nAuthors: Piwosz, K.; Villena-Alemany, C.; Calkiewicz, J.; Mujakic, I.; Nahlik, V.; Dean, J.; Koblizek, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572764\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/572764v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\"\u003e View larger version (30K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137b8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114994forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d2fd6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@efae2d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are an important component of freshwater bacterioplankton. They can support their heterotrophic metabolism with energy from light, and by that enhance their growth efficiency. Based on results from cultures, it was hypothesized that photoheterotrophy provides an advantage under carbon limitation and facilitates access to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources. However, verification of these hypotheses for natural AAP communities has been lacking. Here, we conducted whole community manipulation experiments and compared the growth of AAP bacteria under carbon limited and with recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources under dark and light conditions to elucidate how they profit from photoheterotrophy. We found that it depends on the season. In spring, AAP bacteria induce photoheterotrophic metabolism under carbon limitation but they outperform heterotrophic bacteria when carbon is available. This effect seems to be driven by physiological responses rather than changes at the community level. In autumn photoheterotrophy is less beneficial. In both seasons, AAP bacteria responded negatively to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources in light. This unexpected observation may have ecosystem-level consequences as lake browning continues. In general, our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of AAP bacteria observed in pelagic environments.\nEffects of sampling methodology on phenology indices: insights from sites across India and modelling\nAuthors: Tiruvaimozhi, Y.; Teegalapalli, K.; Reddy, A.; Murali, A.; Datta, A.; Krishnan, A.; Ratnam, J.; Sankaran, M.; Ongole, S.; Kasinathan, S.; Raman, T. R. S.; Ramaswami, G.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573352\nPlant phenology is the study of timing and extent of leaf, flower, and fruit production. Phenology data are used to study drivers of cyclicity and seasonality of plant life-history stages, interactions with organisms such as pollinators, and effects of global change factors. Indices such as timing of phenological events, proportion of individuals in a particular phenophase, seasonality, and synchrony have often been used to summarise plant phenology data. However, these indices have specific utilities and limitations and may be sensitive to sampling methodology, making cross-site comparisons challenging, particularly when data collection methods vary in terms of sample size, observation frequency, and the resolution at which phenophase intensity scores/values are recorded. We use fruiting phenology data from tropical trees across five sites in India to study the effects of sampling methodology on two indices: an index of population-level synchrony (overlap), and an index of seasonality. We supplement these results with simulations of fast- and slow-changing phenologies to test for the effects of sampling methodology on these indices. We found that the overlap index is sensitive to the phenophase intensity measurement resolution--with coarser intensity measures leading to overestimation of the overlap index. The seasonality index, on the other hand, was not affected by intensity resolution. Simulations indicated that finer intensity resolution is more important than frequency of observation to accurately estimate population synchrony and seasonality for fast- and slow-changing phenophases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for study design of future tropical tree phenology research, particularly for long-term or cross-site studies.\nEmerging dynamic regimes and tipping points from finite empirical principles\nAuthors: Cobo-Lopez, S.; Witt, M.; Rohwer, F. L.; Luque, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573307\nAll dynamical systems are transient. The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.\nFirst evidence of a causal link between genetic variation and thermal adaptation in a schistosome host snail\nAuthors: Maes, T.; Verheyen, J.; Senghor, B.; Mudavanhu, A.; Schols, R.; Hellemans, B.; Geslain, E.; Volckaert, F. A. M.; Gante, H. F.; Huyse, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573866\nFreshwater snails are pivotal in transmitting schistosomiasis, a tropical parasitic disease affecting over 150 million people. The adaptive potential of these snails is a critical factor in determining how climate change and other environmental factors influence disease transmission dynamics, yet it has remained unexplored. Bulinus truncatus is the schistosome intermediate host snail with the widest geographic distribution and therefore plays a pivotal role in determining the maximum range of urogenital schistosomiasis. In this study, we assessed the local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus to temperature through an integrative approach encompassing phenotypic, ecophysiological, and genomic data. Ten snail populations from diverse thermal environments were collected in three countries, with eight populations reared in a common garden. The F2 generation (total N= 2592) was exposed to eight chronic temperature treatments and various life-history traits were recorded for over 14 weeks. Subsequently, ecophysiological analyses were conducted on the ten last surviving snails per population. Genotyping the parental generation collected in the field using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, revealed 12,875 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 4.91 % were potentially under selection. We observed a significant association between these outlier SNPs, temperature, and precipitation. Thermal adaptations in life-history traits were evident, with lower survival rates at high temperatures of warm-origin snails compensated for by higher reproduction rates. Cold-origin snails, on the other hand, exhibited higher growth rates adapted to a shorter growing season. Ecophysiological adaptations included elevated sugar and haemoglobin contents in cold-adapted snails. In contrast, warm-adapted snails displayed increased protein levels but also more oxidative damage. Furthermore, heightened phenoloxidase levels indicated a more robust immune response in snails from parasite-rich regions. The substantial local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus holds profound implications for its response to climate change, future schistosomiasis risk, and the effectiveness of schistosomiasis control measures.\nDispersal and evolution of the invasive snail Pomacea canaliculata, an intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis: A field study around its initial introduction site in China\nAuthors: Luo, D.; Zhang, H.; Gu, D.; Mu, X.; Song, H.; Yang, Y.; Xu, M.; Luo, J.; Hu, Y.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573677\nEosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an emerging infectious disease in mainland China. The invasive snail (Pomacea canaliculata) is one of the main intermediate host of the zoonotic nematode. To gain insights into the spatial distribution, phenotypic variation and dispersal pattern of the snail populations. A field survey was conducted using modified nested sampling and selecting ditches as the main habitats. Snail distribution and abundance were displayed with predictions based on an inverse distance-weighted model. Correlation and spatial autocorrelation were analyzed among the measured parameters. The findings of this study demonstrate the well-established and abundant presence of P. canaliculata in ditches. A total of 564 sampling sites were assessed, with measurements taken on 10,145 snails having shell heights greater than 1.5 cm. The average population density was determined to be 20.31 {+/-} 11.55 snails per square meter. Morphological analysis revealed an average snail body mass of 8.93 {+/-} 3.95 g, shell height of 3.38 {+/-} 0.66 cm, a sex ratio of 2.39 {+/-} 1.01 female to male, and a shell color ratio of 9.34 {+/-} 7.52 brown to yellow. Among these measurements, body mass was found to be significantly correlated with shell height (r = 0.88, p \u003c 0.01) and shell color (r = 0.55, p \u003c 0.05). Spatial-correlation analysis proved that shell height was the only factor significantly spatially autocorrelated (MI = 0.27, z = 2.20, p = 0.03), although weak autocorrelations appeared in body mass and shell color. The observed geographic variations of phenotypic traits indicated a human-mediated evolving process of the snail populations and a potential complexity of the parasite transmission system. These findings may enhance the assessment of the epidemiological health risk posed by angiostrongyliasis and inform strategies for controlling infectious snails.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Despite the importance of healthy soils for human livelihood, wellbeing, and safety, current gaps in our knowledge and understanding of biodiversity in soil are numerous, undermining conservation efforts. These gaps are particularly wide in mountain regions where healthy soils are especially important for human safety and yet evidence is accumulating of ongoing degradation, posing significant threats to ecosystem functioning and human settlements.

To analyse these gaps in detail, we synthesise current research on the global diversity of microorganisms, cryptogams, and invertebrates in mountain soils above the treeline. This synthesis is based on a semi-quantitative survey of the literature and an expert-based analysis. Our work reveals not only deficiencies in geographic cover but also significant gaps in taxonomic coverage, particularly among soil protists and invertebrates, and a lack of (functional and ecological) description of the uncultivated majority of prokaryotes, fungi, and protists. We subsequently build on this overview to highlight opportunities for research on mountain soils as systems of co-occurring species that interact in complex environmental matrices to fulfil critical functions and make essential contributions to life on land.

Closing gaps in biodiversity research in mountain soil is crucial to enhance our understanding and to promote laws and guidelines advancing international soil biodiversity conservation targets in mountains. Addressing sparse and biased data, recognizing the impact of environmental changes on mountain ecosystems, and advocating dedicated policies are essential strategies to safeguard mountain soils and their biodiversity.

        <p class="abstract">Marine mammal foraging grounds are popular focal points for marine protected area (MPA) implementation, but may be temporally dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring to infer prey availability and abundance. Marine mammal distributions are assumed to be driven by their prey in foraging areas, but limited understanding of prey distributions often prevents us from exploring how shifting prey availability impacts both seasonal and long-term marine mammal distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding could enhance understanding of marine mammal habitat use in relation to their prey through simultaneous monitoring of both. However, eDNA applications focused on marine mammals or predator-prey dynamics have been limited to date. In this study, we assess spatiotemporal changes in the availability and abundance of minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) prey species in a newly established MPA, employing eDNA metabarcoding. We recovered 105 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from marine vertebrates using two primer sets targeting 12S and 16S genes, along with 112 OTUs from a broader eukaryotic primer set targeting 18S rRNA. Overall, key forage fish prey species, sandeels and clupeids, were the most abundant teleost fishes detected, although their availability varied temporally and with distance from shore. We also found clear spatial partitioning between coastal bottlenose dolphins and the more pelagic minke whales and harbour porpoises, paralleling availability of their main prey species. Other species of conservation interest were also detected including the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), blue fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), and the invasive pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This study demonstrates the application of eDNA to detect spatiotemporal trends in the occurrence and abundance of cetacean predators and their prey, furthering our understanding of fine-scale habitat use within MPAs. Future, long-term monitoring of predator-prey dynamics with eDNA could improve our ability to predict climate-induced shifts in foraging grounds and enhance rapid responses with appropriate management actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phenotypic plasticity can either hinder or facilitate genetic evolution, thus affecting macroevolution. However, the mechanisms and associations of phenotypic plasticity with biodiversity patterns remain unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phenotypic plasticity on adaptive evolution in the context of climatic changes and plasticity costs, specifically examining the rates of trait evolution, speciation, extinction, and diversification. We employed an eco-evolutionary agent-based model, incorporating body temperature as a plastic trait that dynamically responds to fluctuations in environmental temperature. We found the same pattern of results for both climate and plasticity cost contexts. We found that an increase in plasticity leads to a decrease in extinction and trait evolution rates, with high plasticity serving to postpone mass extinction events. Systems with plastic species experience higher speciation rates. Additionally, as plasticity increases in systems, diversification rates also increase. Our study supports the hypothesis that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. It provides new insights into the effect of plasticity on adaptive evolution at larger scales, considering relevant mechanisms and factors such as population size, grouping, occupancy, plasticity extension, and dispersion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impacts of fragmentation are often overlooked in landscape studies investigating how habitat loss impacts biodiversity, despite the casual relationship linking both processes. As habitat loss is the primary cause of fragmentation, understanding the inter-related effects of these twin processes on biodiversity is key to minimise biodiversity loss. Here we assess how habitat amount and configuration influence insectivorous bat assemblages, considering both the direct effects of these processes, as well as the indirect effects of habitat amount mediated through configuration. Bats were acoustically surveyed along independent gradients of habitat amount (forest cover) and configuration (number of patches and edge density) across 28 insular landscapes embedded within a Malaysian hydroelectric reservoir. Using Structural Equation Modelling, the direct and indirect effects of habitat amount were examined on bat sonotype richness, total, and guild-specific activity (forest, edge and open-space foragers). Forest cover had a direct and positive effect on sonotype richness and forest forager activity. The quadratic relationship linking edge density and forest cover was strong and overall positive, but while below 30% of forest cover, increasingly forested landscapes had increasingly high edge densities, the opposite pattern was observed in more forested landscapes. On the other hand, increasingly forested landscapes consistently harboured less patches. Owing to the overall low habitat amount in our landscapes and negative edge effects, the indirect effects of forest cover (mediated through edge density) were therefore negative on sonotype richness, outweighing any positive direct effect. The number of patches had little effect on the bat assemblage, except on total activity which was higher in landscapes harbouring more forest patches. As a result, negative indirect effects of forest cover mediated through number of patches were only observed on total activity. Our results highlight that, in natural settings, habitat amount can hardly be altered without influencing habitat configuration, thereby preventing any independent management of these threats. Minimising habitat loss is therefore essential to balance the associated prevailing negative effects of fragmentation on insectivorous bats across tropical forests.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecological and evolutionary processes shape the dynamics of interacting species, yet the drivers of eco-evolutionary feedback remain elusive. Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.</p>

They can support their heterotrophic metabolism with energy from light, and by that enhance their growth efficiency. Based on results from cultures, it was hypothesized that photoheterotrophy provides an advantage under carbon limitation and facilitates access to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources. However, verification of these hypotheses for natural AAP communities has been lacking. Here, we conducted whole community manipulation experiments and compared the growth of AAP bacteria under carbon limited and with recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources under dark and light conditions to elucidate how they profit from photoheterotrophy. We found that it depends on the season. In spring, AAP bacteria induce photoheterotrophic metabolism under carbon limitation but they outperform heterotrophic bacteria when carbon is available. This effect seems to be driven by physiological responses rather than changes at the community level. In autumn photoheterotrophy is less beneficial. In both seasons, AAP bacteria responded negatively to recalcitrant or low-energy carbon sources in light. This unexpected observation may have ecosystem-level consequences as lake browning continues. In general, our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of AAP bacteria observed in pelagic environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant phenology is the study of timing and extent of leaf, flower, and fruit production. Phenology data are used to study drivers of cyclicity and seasonality of plant life-history stages, interactions with organisms such as pollinators, and effects of global change factors. Indices such as timing of phenological events, proportion of individuals in a particular phenophase, seasonality, and synchrony have often been used to summarise plant phenology data. However, these indices have specific utilities and limitations and may be sensitive to sampling methodology, making cross-site comparisons challenging, particularly when data collection methods vary in terms of sample size, observation frequency, and the resolution at which phenophase intensity scores/values are recorded. We use fruiting phenology data from tropical trees across five sites in India to study the effects of sampling methodology on two indices: an index of population-level synchrony (overlap), and an index of seasonality. We supplement these results with simulations of fast- and slow-changing phenologies to test for the effects of sampling methodology on these indices. We found that the overlap index is sensitive to the phenophase intensity measurement resolution--with coarser intensity measures leading to overestimation of the overlap index. The seasonality index, on the other hand, was not affected by intensity resolution. Simulations indicated that finer intensity resolution is more important than frequency of observation to accurately estimate population synchrony and seasonality for fast- and slow-changing phenophases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for study design of future tropical tree phenology research, particularly for long-term or cross-site studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All dynamical systems are transient. The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Freshwater snails are pivotal in transmitting schistosomiasis, a tropical parasitic disease affecting over 150 million people. The adaptive potential of these snails is a critical factor in determining how climate change and other environmental factors influence disease transmission dynamics, yet it has remained unexplored. Bulinus truncatus is the schistosome intermediate host snail with the widest geographic distribution and therefore plays a pivotal role in determining the maximum range of urogenital schistosomiasis. In this study, we assessed the local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus to temperature through an integrative approach encompassing phenotypic, ecophysiological, and genomic data. Ten snail populations from diverse thermal environments were collected in three countries, with eight populations reared in a common garden. The F2 generation (total N= 2592) was exposed to eight chronic temperature treatments and various life-history traits were recorded for over 14 weeks. Subsequently, ecophysiological analyses were conducted on the ten last surviving snails per population. Genotyping the parental generation collected in the field using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, revealed 12,875 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 4.91 % were potentially under selection. We observed a significant association between these outlier SNPs, temperature, and precipitation. Thermal adaptations in life-history traits were evident, with lower survival rates at high temperatures of warm-origin snails compensated for by higher reproduction rates. Cold-origin snails, on the other hand, exhibited higher growth rates adapted to a shorter growing season. Ecophysiological adaptations included elevated sugar and haemoglobin contents in cold-adapted snails. In contrast, warm-adapted snails displayed increased protein levels but also more oxidative damage. Furthermore, heightened phenoloxidase levels indicated a more robust immune response in snails from parasite-rich regions. The substantial local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus holds profound implications for its response to climate change, future schistosomiasis risk, and the effectiveness of schistosomiasis control measures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an emerging infectious disease in mainland China. The invasive snail (Pomacea canaliculata) is one of the main intermediate host of the zoonotic nematode. To gain insights into the spatial distribution, phenotypic variation and dispersal pattern of the snail populations. A field survey was conducted using modified nested sampling and selecting ditches as the main habitats. Snail distribution and abundance were displayed with predictions based on an inverse distance-weighted model. Correlation and spatial autocorrelation were analyzed among the measured parameters. The findings of this study demonstrate the well-established and abundant presence of P. canaliculata in ditches. A total of 564 sampling sites were assessed, with measurements taken on 10,145 snails having shell heights greater than 1.5 cm. The average population density was determined to be 20.31 {&#43;/-} 11.55 snails per square meter. Morphological analysis revealed an average snail body mass of 8.93 {&#43;/-} 3.95 g, shell height of 3.38 {&#43;/-} 0.66 cm, a sex ratio of 2.39 {&#43;/-} 1.01 female to male, and a shell color ratio of 9.34 {&#43;/-} 7.52 brown to yellow. Among these measurements, body mass was found to be significantly correlated with shell height (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01) and shell color (r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.05). Spatial-correlation analysis proved that shell height was the only factor significantly spatially autocorrelated (MI = 0.27, z = 2.20, p = 0.03), although weak autocorrelations appeared in body mass and shell color. The observed geographic variations of phenotypic traits indicated a human-mediated evolving process of the snail populations and a potential complexity of the parasite transmission system. These findings may enhance the assessment of the epidemiological health risk posed by angiostrongyliasis and inform strategies for controlling infectious snails.</p>
