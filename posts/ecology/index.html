In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.\nContribution of carbon inputs to soil carbon accumulation cannot be neglected\nAuthors: He, X.; Abramoff, R.; Abs, E.; Georgiou, K.; Zhang, H.; Goll, D. S.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549330\nIn a recently published paper (1), the authors report that microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is the primary determinant of global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and that the relative impact of plant carbon inputs on SOC is minor. While soil microbes undoubtedly play an important role in soil organic carbon cycling, we are concerned about the robustness of the approach taken by Tao et al. (1) and highlight potential biases in their analyses that may lead to misleading, model-dependent results.\nIncreased thermal tolerance under anoxic conditions in an extremophile fish from hot sulfur springs in Mexico\nAuthors: Pacher, K.; Hernandez-Roman, N.; Juarez-Lopez, A.; Jimenez-Jimenez, J. E.; Lukas, J.; Sevinchan, Y.; Krause, J.; Arias-Rodriguez, L.; Bierbach, D.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550037\nThe thermal ecology of ectotherm animals has gained considerable attention in the face of human induced climate change. Particularly in aquatic species the experimental assessment of critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) may help to predict possible effects of global warming on habitat suitability and ultimately species survival. Here we present data on the thermal limits of two endemic and endangered extremophile fish species, inhabiting a geothermally-heated and sulfur-rich spring system in Southern Mexico: The sulfur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria) and the widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma). Besides physiological challenges induced by toxic hydrogen sulfide and related severe hypoxia during the day, water temperatures have been previously reported to exceed those of nearby clearwater streams. We now present temperature data for various locations and years in the sulphur spring complex and conducted laboratory thermal tolerance tests (CTmin and CTmax) both under normoxic as well as sever hypoxic conditions in both species. Average CTmax limits did not differ between species under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly P. sulphuraria was found to reach a higher critical temperature (CTmax = 43.2{degrees}C) when tested under hypoxic conditions, while G. eurystoma on average had a lower CTmax when oxygen was absent. Based on this data we calculated both species thermal safety margins and used a TDT (thermal death time) model framework to relate our experimental data to observed temperatures in the natural habitat. Our findings suggest, that both species live near their thermal limits during the annual dry season and are locally already exposed to temperatures above their critical thermal limits. We discuss these findings in the light of possible physiological adaptions of the sulfur-adapted fish species and the anthropogenic threats for this unique system.\ntidysdm: leveraging the flexibility of tidymodels for Species Distribution Modelling in R\nAuthors: Leonardi, M.; Colucci, M.; Manica, A.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550358\nIn species distribution modelling (SDM), it is common practice to explore multiple machine-learning algorithms and combine their results into ensembles. This is no easy task in R: different algorithms were developed independently, with inconsistent syntax and data structures. Specialised SDM packages integrate multiple algorithms by creating a complex interface between the user (providing a unified input and receiving a unified output), and the back-end code (that tackles the specific needs depending on the algorithm). This requires a lot of work to create and maintain the right interface, and it prevents an easy integration of other methods that may become available. Here we present tidysdm, an R package that solves this problem by taking advantage of the tidymodels universe. Being part of the tidyverse, (i) it has standardised grammar and data structures providing a coherent interface for modelling, (ii) includes packages designed for fitting, tuning, and validating various models, and (iii) allows easy integration of new algorithms and methods. tidysdm allows easy, flexible and quick species distribution modelling by supporting standard algorithms, including additional SDM-oriented functions, and giving the opportunity of using any algorithm or procedure to fit, tune and validate a large number of different models. Additionally, it provides further functions to easily fit models based on paleo/time-scattered data. The package includes two vignettes detailing standard procedures for present-day and time-scattered data. These vignettes also showcase the integration with pastclim (Leonardi et al. 2023) to allow easier access to palaeoclimatic data series, if needed, but users can bring in their own climatic data in standard formats.\nSources of prey availability data alter interpretation of outputs from prey choice null networks\nAuthors: Cuff, J. P.; Tercel, M. P.; Windsor, F. M.; Hawthorne, B. S.; Hamback, P. A.; Bell, J. R.; Symondson, W. O.; Vaughan, I. P.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.549927\nO_LINull models provide an invaluable baseline against which to test fundamental ecological hypotheses and highlight patterns in foraging choices that cannot be explained by neutral processes or sampling artefacts. In this way, null models can advance our understanding beyond simplistic dietary descriptions to identify drivers of interactions. This method, however, requires estimates of resource availability, which are generally imperfect representations of highly dynamic systems. Optimising method selection is crucial for study design, but the precise effects of different resource availability data on the efficacy of null models are poorly understood. C_LIO_LIUsing spider-prey networks as a model, we used prey abundance (suction sample) and activity density (sticky trap) data, and combinations of the two, to simulate null networks. We compared null diet composition, network properties (e.g., connectance and nestedness) and deviations of simulations from metabarcoding-based spider dietary data (to ascertain how different prey availability data alter ecological interpretation. C_LIO_LIDifferent sampling methods produced different null networks and inferred distinct prey selectivity. Null networks based on prey abundance and combined frequency-of-occurrence data more closely resembled the observed diet composition, and those based on prey abundance, activity density and proportionally combined data generated network properties most like dietary metabarcoding networks. C_LIO_LIWe show that survey method choice impacts all aspects of null network analyses, the precise effects varying between methods but ultimately altering ecological interpretation by increasing disparity in network properties or trophic niches between null and directly constructed networks. Merging datasets can generate more complete prey availability data but is not a panacea because it introduces different biases. The choice of method should reflect the research hypotheses and study system being investigated. Ultimately, survey methods should emulate the foraging mode of the focal predator as closely as possible, informed by the known ecology, natural history and behaviour of the predator.

G.; Erez, A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550682\nMicrobes grow in a wide variety of environments and must balance growth and stress resistance. Despite the prevalence of such trade-offs, understanding of their role in non-steady environments is limited. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model of \"growth debt\", where microbes grow rapidly initially, paying later with slower growth or heightened mortality. We first compare our model to a classical chemostat experiment, validating our proposed dynamics and quantifying Escherichia colis stress resistance dynamics. Extending the chemostat theory to include serial-dilution cultures, we derive phase diagrams for the persistence of \"debtor\" microbes. We find that debtors cannot coexist with non-debtors if \"payment\" is increased mortality but can coexist if it lowers enzyme affinity. Surprisingly, weak noise considerably extends the persistence of resistance elements, pertinent for antibiotic management. Our microbial debt theory, broadly applicable across many environments, bridges the gap between chemostat and serial dilution systems.\nMacroecological laws in experimental microbial systems\nAuthors: Shoemaker, W. R.; Sanchez, A.; Grilli, J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550281\nHistorically, ecology has benefited by characterizing statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities. This approach, known as macroecology, has achieved considerable success in microbial ecology in recent years, having identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models that do not require interactions between community members. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role in the fields development, as the manipulation of high-replication time-series has revealed novel forces that govern community dynamics. However, there remains a gap between microbial experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems. Here, we work to bridge the gap between the experimental manipulation of communities and their macroecological effects. Using high-replication time-series of experimental microbial communities, we demonstrate that macroecological laws observed in nature can be readily recapitulated in a laboratory setting and unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We find that demographic manipulations and their effect on community-level variation can alter empirical patterns in a manner that diverges from our predictions, though the predictive capacity of the SLM can be restored by incorporating explicit experimental details. Finally, we demonstrate the extent that experimental manipulations are capable of altering macroecological patterns under the SLM, establishing a demarcation between macroecological effects we can and cannot observe in a laboratory setting.\nThe ecological consequences of microbial metabolic strategies in fluctuating environments\nAuthors: Wang, Z.; Goyal, A.; Maslov, S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550395\nMicrobes adopt a variety of metabolic strategies to consume resources in fluctuating environments, but most work has focused on understanding these strategies in the context of isolated species, rather than diverse natural communities. We systematically measure the feasibility, dynamical and structural stability of multispecies microbial communities adopting different metabolic strategies. Our results reveal key distinctions between the ecological properties of different metabolic strategies, showing that communities containing sequential utilizers are more resilient to resource fluctuations, but are less feasible than co-utilizing communities.\nFunctional traits fail to predict long-term responses to climate change\nAuthors: Ash, J. D.; Li, D.; Johnson, S. E.; Rogers, D. A.; Waller, D. M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550868\nAimEnvironmental conditions strongly affect the distribution and abundance of species via complex forces. Shifts in environmental conditions and differences in the speed and scale of these effects complicate our efforts to infer how species will respond to future environmental change. We test how 18 functional traits affect plant species responses to gradients in environmental conditions and 50-year shifts in climate. LocationWe analyzed 50-year shifts in the distribution and abundance of 153 plant species distributed across 284 sites in Wisconsin, USA. Time period1950s to 2000s. Major taxa studiedVascular plants (much of the flora of NE North America). MethodsWe used random forest and integrated hierarchical mixed models to test how plant abundances (and 50-year changes in abundance) track gradients in overstory, soil, and climatic conditions. ResultsWithin study periods, plant abundances reflect gradients in environmental conditions. Leaf traits affected local abundance (both directly and via trait-environment interactions) in the 1950s and 2000s. Strong soil and temperature effects in the 1950s have weakened while precipitation effects have strengthened. Although we expected these models to also predict how plants would respond to shifts in climate, they did not. Main conclusionsLags in species responses, increases in the stochastic forces affecting community assembly, and other forces limit the ability of models fitted to static data (e.g., space-for-time substitutions) to predict how plant species will respond to long-term shifts in environmental conditions. We must therefore be cautious about applying trait-based species distribution models to predict how climate change will affect species distributions and community structure.\nGlobal meta-analysis reveals overall benefits of silvopastoral systems for biodiversity\nAuthors: Perez-Alvarez, R.; Chara, J.; Snyder, L. D.; Bonatti, M.; Sieber, S.; Martin, E. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551160\nDomestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the world's terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A central challenge in community ecology is predicting the effects of abiotic factors on community assembly. In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In a recently published paper (1), the authors report that microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is the primary determinant of global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and that the relative impact of plant carbon inputs on SOC is minor. While soil microbes undoubtedly play an important role in soil organic carbon cycling, we are concerned about the robustness of the approach taken by Tao et al. (1) and highlight potential biases in their analyses that may lead to misleading, model-dependent results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The thermal ecology of ectotherm animals has gained considerable attention in the face of human induced climate change. Particularly in aquatic species the experimental assessment of critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) may help to predict possible effects of global warming on habitat suitability and ultimately species survival. Here we present data on the thermal limits of two endemic and endangered extremophile fish species, inhabiting a geothermally-heated and sulfur-rich spring system in Southern Mexico: The sulfur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria) and the widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma). Besides physiological challenges induced by toxic hydrogen sulfide and related severe hypoxia during the day, water temperatures have been previously reported to exceed those of nearby clearwater streams. We now present temperature data for various locations and years in the sulphur spring complex and conducted laboratory thermal tolerance tests (CTmin and CTmax) both under normoxic as well as sever hypoxic conditions in both species. Average CTmax limits did not differ between species under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly P. sulphuraria was found to reach a higher critical temperature (CTmax = 43.2{degrees}C) when tested under hypoxic conditions, while G. eurystoma on average had a lower CTmax when oxygen was absent. Based on this data we calculated both species thermal safety margins and used a TDT (thermal death time) model framework to relate our experimental data to observed temperatures in the natural habitat. Our findings suggest, that both species live near their thermal limits during the annual dry season and are locally already exposed to temperatures above their critical thermal limits. We discuss these findings in the light of possible physiological adaptions of the sulfur-adapted fish species and the anthropogenic threats for this unique system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In species distribution modelling (SDM), it is common practice to explore multiple machine-learning algorithms and combine their results into ensembles. This is no easy task in R: different algorithms were developed independently, with inconsistent syntax and data structures. Specialised SDM packages integrate multiple algorithms by creating a complex interface between the user (providing a unified input and receiving a unified output), and the back-end code (that tackles the specific needs depending on the algorithm). This requires a lot of work to create and maintain the right interface, and it prevents an easy integration of other methods that may become available.

Here we present tidysdm, an R package that solves this problem by taking advantage of the tidymodels universe. Being part of the tidyverse, (i) it has standardised grammar and data structures providing a coherent interface for modelling, (ii) includes packages designed for fitting, tuning, and validating various models, and (iii) allows easy integration of new algorithms and methods.

tidysdm allows easy, flexible and quick species distribution modelling by supporting standard algorithms, including additional SDM-oriented functions, and giving the opportunity of using any algorithm or procedure to fit, tune and validate a large number of different models. Additionally, it provides further functions to easily fit models based on paleo/time-scattered data.

The package includes two vignettes detailing standard procedures for present-day and time-scattered data. These vignettes also showcase the integration with pastclim (Leonardi et al. 2023) to allow easier access to palaeoclimatic data series, if needed, but users can bring in their own climatic data in standard formats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LINull models provide an invaluable baseline against which to test fundamental ecological hypotheses and highlight patterns in foraging choices that cannot be explained by neutral processes or sampling artefacts. In this way, null models can advance our understanding beyond simplistic dietary descriptions to identify drivers of interactions. This method, however, requires estimates of resource availability, which are generally imperfect representations of highly dynamic systems. Optimising method selection is crucial for study design, but the precise effects of different resource availability data on the efficacy of null models are poorly understood.
C_LIO_LIUsing spider-prey networks as a model, we used prey abundance (suction sample) and activity density (sticky trap) data, and combinations of the two, to simulate null networks. We compared null diet composition, network properties (e.g., connectance and nestedness) and deviations of simulations from metabarcoding-based spider dietary data (to ascertain how different prey availability data alter ecological interpretation.
C_LIO_LIDifferent sampling methods produced different null networks and inferred distinct prey selectivity. Null networks based on prey abundance and combined frequency-of-occurrence data more closely resembled the observed diet composition, and those based on prey abundance, activity density and proportionally combined data generated network properties most like dietary metabarcoding networks.
C_LIO_LIWe show that survey method choice impacts all aspects of null network analyses, the precise effects varying between methods but ultimately altering ecological interpretation by increasing disparity in network properties or trophic niches between null and directly constructed networks. Merging datasets can generate more complete prey availability data but is not a panacea because it introduces different biases. The choice of method should reflect the research hypotheses and study system being investigated. Ultimately, survey methods should emulate the foraging mode of the focal predator as closely as possible, informed by the known ecology, natural history and behaviour of the predator.

        <p class="abstract">Microbes grow in a wide variety of environments and must balance growth and stress resistance. Despite the prevalence of such trade-offs, understanding of their role in non-steady environments is limited. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model of &#34;growth debt&#34;, where microbes grow rapidly initially, paying later with slower growth or heightened mortality. We first compare our model to a classical chemostat experiment, validating our proposed dynamics and quantifying Escherichia colis stress resistance dynamics. Extending the chemostat theory to include serial-dilution cultures, we derive phase diagrams for the persistence of &#34;debtor&#34; microbes. We find that debtors cannot coexist with non-debtors if &#34;payment&#34; is increased mortality but can coexist if it lowers enzyme affinity. Surprisingly, weak noise considerably extends the persistence of resistance elements, pertinent for antibiotic management. Our microbial debt theory, broadly applicable across many environments, bridges the gap between chemostat and serial dilution systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Historically, ecology has benefited by characterizing statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities. This approach, known as macroecology, has achieved considerable success in microbial ecology in recent years, having identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models that do not require interactions between community members. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role in the fields development, as the manipulation of high-replication time-series has revealed novel forces that govern community dynamics. However, there remains a gap between microbial experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems. Here, we work to bridge the gap between the experimental manipulation of communities and their macroecological effects. Using high-replication time-series of experimental microbial communities, we demonstrate that macroecological laws observed in nature can be readily recapitulated in a laboratory setting and unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We find that demographic manipulations and their effect on community-level variation can alter empirical patterns in a manner that diverges from our predictions, though the predictive capacity of the SLM can be restored by incorporating explicit experimental details. Finally, we demonstrate the extent that experimental manipulations are capable of altering macroecological patterns under the SLM, establishing a demarcation between macroecological effects we can and cannot observe in a laboratory setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbes adopt a variety of metabolic strategies to consume resources in fluctuating environments, but most work has focused on understanding these strategies in the context of isolated species, rather than diverse natural communities. We systematically measure the feasibility, dynamical and structural stability of multispecies microbial communities adopting different metabolic strategies. Our results reveal key distinctions between the ecological properties of different metabolic strategies, showing that communities containing sequential utilizers are more resilient to resource fluctuations, but are less feasible than co-utilizing communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimEnvironmental conditions strongly affect the distribution and abundance of species via complex forces. Shifts in environmental conditions and differences in the speed and scale of these effects complicate our efforts to infer how species will respond to future environmental change. We test how 18 functional traits affect plant species responses to gradients in environmental conditions and 50-year shifts in climate.

LocationWe analyzed 50-year shifts in the distribution and abundance of 153 plant species distributed across 284 sites in Wisconsin, USA.

Time period1950s to 2000s.

Major taxa studiedVascular plants (much of the flora of NE North America).

MethodsWe used random forest and integrated hierarchical mixed models to test how plant abundances (and 50-year changes in abundance) track gradients in overstory, soil, and climatic conditions.

ResultsWithin study periods, plant abundances reflect gradients in environmental conditions. Leaf traits affected local abundance (both directly and via trait-environment interactions) in the 1950s and 2000s. Strong soil and temperature effects in the 1950s have weakened while precipitation effects have strengthened. Although we expected these models to also predict how plants would respond to shifts in climate, they did not.

Main conclusionsLags in species responses, increases in the stochastic forces affecting community assembly, and other forces limit the ability of models fitted to static data (e.g., space-for-time substitutions) to predict how plant species will respond to long-term shifts in environmental conditions. We must therefore be cautious about applying trait-based species distribution models to predict how climate change will affect species distributions and community structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Domestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the world&#39;s terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.</p>
