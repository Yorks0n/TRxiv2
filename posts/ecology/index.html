C.\nScore: 36.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559203\nFive years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.\nBringing circuit theory into spatial occupancy models to assess landscape connectivity\nAuthors: Kervellec, M.; Couturier, T.; Bauduin, S.; Chenesseau, D.; Defos du Rau, P.; Drouet-Hoguet, N.; Duchamp, C.; Steinmetz, J.; Vandel, J.-M.; Gimenez, O.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559320\nConnectivity shapes species distribution across fragmented landscapes. Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.\nDeep learning to extract the meteorological by-catch of wildlife cameras\nAuthors: Alison, J.; Payne, S.; Alexander, J.

T.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.558780\nMicroclimate - proximal climatic variation at scales of meters and minutes - can exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. However, most microclimate studies are temperature-centric, and do not consider meteorological factors such as sunshine, hail and snow. Meanwhile, remote cameras have become a primary tool to monitor wild plants and animals, even at micro-scales, with deep learning tools to rapidly convert images into ecological data. However, deep learning applications for wildlife imagery have focused exclusively on living subjects. Here, we identify an overlooked opportunity to extract latent, yet ecologically relevant, meteorological information. We produce an annotated image dataset of micrometeorological conditions across 49 wildlife cameras in South Africas Maloti-Drakensberg and the Swiss Alps. We train ensemble deep learning models to classify conditions as overcast, sunshine, hail or snow. Our best model achieves 91.7% accuracy on test cameras not seen during training. Furthermore, we show how effective accuracy is raised to 96% by disregarding 14.1% of classifications where ensemble member models did not reach a consensus. Unlike previous studies we test model performance in remote and novel locations, distinguishing overcast and sunny conditions in Svalbard, Norway with 79.3% accuracy (93.9% consensus accuracy). Our model rapidly classifies sunshine, snow and hail in almost 2 million unlabeled images. Resulting micrometeorological data illustrated common seasonal patterns of summer hailstorms and autumn snowfalls across mountains in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, daily patterns of sunshine and shade diverged between sites, impacting daily temperature cycles. Crucially, we leverage micrometeorological data to demonstrate that (1) experimental warming using open-top chambers shortens early snow events in autumn, and (2) image-derived sunshine marginally outperforms sensor-derived temperature when predicting bumblebee foraging. These methods generate novel micrometeorological variables in synchrony with biological recordings, enabling new insights from an increasingly global network of wildlife cameras.\nSurvey of white-footed mice in Connecticut, USA reveals low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and infection with divergent betacoronaviruses\nAuthors: Earnest, R.; Hahn, A.

D.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559030\nDiverse mammalian species display susceptibility to and infection with SARS-CoV-2. Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named Peromyscus coronavirus-1 and -2. Both belong to the Betacoronavirus 1 species and are [~]90% identical to the closest known relative, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk. However, the discovery of divergent, non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses expands the diversity of known rodent coronaviruses and further investigation is required to understand their transmission extent.\nA tipping point in West Antarctica in 2023's circumpolar 5-sigma event? a glimpse from the emperor penguin's perspective\nAuthors: Kruger, L.; Vianna, J. A.; Le Bohec, C.; Cardenas, C. A.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559910\nEmperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.\nEvaluating goodness-of-fit of animal movement models using lineups\nAuthors: Fieberg, J.; Signer, J.; Freeman, S.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559591\nModels of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.\nSediment source and dose influence the larval performance of the threatened coral Orbicella faveolata\nAuthors: Serrano, X.; Rosales, S. M.; Miller, M. W.; Palacio-Castro, A. M.; Williamson, O. M.; Gomez, A.; Baker, A. C.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559035\nThe effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.\nSeasonality of host-seeking Ixodes ricinus nymph abundance in relation to climate\nAuthors: Hoch, T.; Madouasse, A.; Jacquot, M.; Wongnak, P.; Beugnet, F.; Bournez, L.; Huard, F.; Moutailler, S.; Plantard, O.; Poux, V.; Rene-Martellet, M.; Vayssier-Taussat, M.; Verheyden, H.; Vourc'h, G.; Chalvet-Monfray, K.; Agoulon, A.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.25.501416\nThere is growing concern about climate change and its impact on human health. Specifically, global warming could increase the probability of emerging infectious diseases, notably because of changes in the geographical and seasonal distributions of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. For example, the range of Ixodes ricinus, the most common and widespread tick species in Europe, is currently expanding northward and at higher altitudes. However, little is known about the seasonal variation in tick abundance in different climates. Seasonality of I. ricinus is often based on expert opinions while field surveys are usually limited in time. Our objective was to describe seasonal variations in I. ricinus abundance under different climates. To this end, a seven-year longitudinal study, with monthly collections of I. ricinus host-seeking nymphs, was carried out in France, in six locations corresponding to different climates. Tick data were log-transformed and grouped between years so as to obtain seasonal variations for a typical year. Daily average temperature was measured during the study period. Seasonal patterns of nymph abundance were established for the six different locations using linear harmonic regression. Model parameters were estimated separately for each location. Seasonal patterns appeared different depending on the climate considered. Western temperate sites showed an early spring peak, a summer minimum and a moderate autumn and winter abundance. More continental sites showed a later peak in spring, and a minimum in winter. The peak occurred in summer for the mountainous site, with an absence of ticks in winter. In all cases except the mountainous site, the timing of the spring peak could be related to the sum of degree days since the beginning of the year. Winter abundance was positively correlated to the corresponding temperature. Our results highlight clear patterns in the different sites corresponding to different climates, which allow further forecast of tick seasonality under changing climate conditions.\nThe Atlantic Forest of South America: spatiotemporal dynamics of remaining vegetation and implications for conservation\nAuthors: Vancine, M. H.; Muylaert, R. L.; Niebuhr, B. B.; Oshima, J. E. d. F.; Tonetti, V.; Bernardo, R.; De Angelo, C.; Rosa, M. R.; Grohmann, C. H.; Ribeiro, M. C.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558076\nThe Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (\u003e500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (\u003c50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is \u003c90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250- 830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (\u003e10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future. HighlightsO_LIThere is 23% forest and 40% natural vegetation cover remaining in the Atlantic Forest. C_LIO_LIBetween 1986-2020, native forest cover decreased by 2.4% and natural vegetation by 3.6%.

The soft tick Ornithodoros moubata is a hematophagous ectoparasite of Suidae, best known for transmitting the African swine fever virus. Its bacterial microbiota is characterized by a high prevalence of Francisella-like and Rickettsia endosymbionts. The present study aims to better understand the potential influence of these two major members of the tick microbiota on the reproductive fitness of O. moubata. A total of 132 adult female ticks were treated with antibiotics using gentamycin or rifampicin added to the blood meal. Half of the ticks were also supplemented with B vitamins to address the nutritional role of endosymbionts. Over two periods of 50 days, several traits related to the reproductive fitness were monitored to investigate the importance of Francisella and Rickettsia for these traits. It appeared that most of the reproductive parameters considered were not affected. However, antibiotic treatments induced an increase in the tick survival, indicating a potential fitness cost of harboring endosymbionts during the tick reproductive cycle. Similarly, 366 first stage nymphs of Ornithodoros moubata were exposed to the same treatments for molecular quantification of both endosymbionts. Results from qPCR suggested that the treatments had a bacteriostatic effect on endosymbionts without completely eliminating neither Francisella-like endosymbiont nor Rickettsia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Five years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Connectivity shapes species distribution across fragmented landscapes. Assessing landscape resistance to dispersal is challenging because dispersal events are rare and difficult to detect especially for elusive species. To address these issues, spatial occupancy models have been developed to integrate the resistance surface concept of landscape ecology and model patch occupancy dynamics through colonization and extinction while accounting for imperfect species detection. However, the most recent approach is based on least-cost path distances which assume that individuals disperse along the optimal route. Here, we develop a new spatial occupancy model that incorporates commute distances derived from circuit theory to model dispersal across sites. Our approach allows for explicit estimation of landscape connectivity and direct measure of uncertainty from detection/non-detection data. To illustrate our approach, we study the recolonisation of two carnivores in France, and quantify the degree to which rivers facilitate Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) dispersal and highways impede Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) recolonisation. Overall, spatial occupancy models provide a flexible framework to acccommodate any distance metric designed to align with species dispersal ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microclimate - proximal climatic variation at scales of meters and minutes - can exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. However, most microclimate studies are temperature-centric, and do not consider meteorological factors such as sunshine, hail and snow. Meanwhile, remote cameras have become a primary tool to monitor wild plants and animals, even at micro-scales, with deep learning tools to rapidly convert images into ecological data. However, deep learning applications for wildlife imagery have focused exclusively on living subjects. Here, we identify an overlooked opportunity to extract latent, yet ecologically relevant, meteorological information.

We produce an annotated image dataset of micrometeorological conditions across 49 wildlife cameras in South Africas Maloti-Drakensberg and the Swiss Alps. We train ensemble deep learning models to classify conditions as overcast, sunshine, hail or snow. Our best model achieves 91.7% accuracy on test cameras not seen during training. Furthermore, we show how effective accuracy is raised to 96% by disregarding 14.1% of classifications where ensemble member models did not reach a consensus. Unlike previous studies we test model performance in remote and novel locations, distinguishing overcast and sunny conditions in Svalbard, Norway with 79.3% accuracy (93.9% consensus accuracy).

Our model rapidly classifies sunshine, snow and hail in almost 2 million unlabeled images. Resulting micrometeorological data illustrated common seasonal patterns of summer hailstorms and autumn snowfalls across mountains in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, daily patterns of sunshine and shade diverged between sites, impacting daily temperature cycles. Crucially, we leverage micrometeorological data to demonstrate that (1) experimental warming using open-top chambers shortens early snow events in autumn, and (2) image-derived sunshine marginally outperforms sensor-derived temperature when predicting bumblebee foraging. These methods generate novel micrometeorological variables in synchrony with biological recordings, enabling new insights from an increasingly global network of wildlife cameras.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Diverse mammalian species display susceptibility to and infection with SARS-CoV-2. Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named Peromyscus coronavirus-1 and -2. Both belong to the Betacoronavirus 1 species and are [~]90% identical to the closest known relative, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk. However, the discovery of divergent, non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses expands the diversity of known rodent coronaviruses and further investigation is required to understand their transmission extent.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emperor penguins are one of the seabird species most vulnerable to climate change in Antarctica, as they depend on stable sea ice for breeding and molting. Recent extremes of warming have taken to the lowest records of sea ice in West Antarctica in 2022 and 2023, raising concerns to the extent that emperor penguins have been affected. We evaluated historical satellite data (1985-2022) of sea ice around the 10 emperor penguin breeding colonies, identified so far along the coast of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and compared them to recent sea ice cover (2022-2023) to identify where and when critical thresholds of sea ice cover have been crossed. We found that the sea ice retreated below the critical thresholds in 2022-2023 during the chick-rearing and in some cases failed to return at the start of the following breeding season, hence likely affecting 9 of the 10 emperor penguin colonies in the region. This is an unprecedented climatic phenomena affecting breeding habitat of emperor penguin colonies over a large area, potentially affecting numerically important colonies in West Antarctica.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Models of animal movement are frequently fit to animal location data to understand how animals respond to and interact with local environmental features. Several open-source software packages are available for analyzing animal movements and can facilitate parameter estimation, yet there are relatively few methods available for evaluating model goodness-of-fit. We describe how a simple graphical technique, the lineup protocol, can be used to evaluate goodness-of-fit of integrated step-selection analyses and hidden Markov models, but the method can be applied much more broadly. We leverage the ability to simulate data from fitted models, and demonstrate the approach using both methods applied to fisher (Pekania pennanti) data. A variety of responses and movement metrics can be used to evaluate models, and the lineup protocol can be tailored to focus on specific model assumptions or movement features that are of primary interest. Although it is possible to evaluate goodness-of-fit using a formal hypothesis test, the method can also be used in a more exploratory fashion (e.g., to visualize variability in model behavior across stochastic simulations or identify areas where the model could be improved). We provide coded examples and two vignettes to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and encourage movement ecologists to consider how their models will be applied when choosing appropriate graphical responses for evaluating goodness-of-fit.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The effects of turbidity and sedimentation stress on early life stages of corals are poorly understood, particularly in Atlantic species. Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, O. faveolata larvae exposed to high doses of either sediment type (Port or Reef) exhibited reduced survival and settlement rates, but only the Port sediments resulted in adverse effects in the low-dose treatment. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbiomes than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbiomes between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is growing concern about climate change and its impact on human health. Specifically, global warming could increase the probability of emerging infectious diseases, notably because of changes in the geographical and seasonal distributions of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. For example, the range of Ixodes ricinus, the most common and widespread tick species in Europe, is currently expanding northward and at higher altitudes. However, little is known about the seasonal variation in tick abundance in different climates. Seasonality of I. ricinus is often based on expert opinions while field surveys are usually limited in time. Our objective was to describe seasonal variations in I. ricinus abundance under different climates. To this end, a seven-year longitudinal study, with monthly collections of I. ricinus host-seeking nymphs, was carried out in France, in six locations corresponding to different climates. Tick data were log-transformed and grouped between years so as to obtain seasonal variations for a typical year. Daily average temperature was measured during the study period. Seasonal patterns of nymph abundance were established for the six different locations using linear harmonic regression. Model parameters were estimated separately for each location. Seasonal patterns appeared different depending on the climate considered. Western temperate sites showed an early spring peak, a summer minimum and a moderate autumn and winter abundance. More continental sites showed a later peak in spring, and a minimum in winter. The peak occurred in summer for the mountainous site, with an absence of ticks in winter. In all cases except the mountainous site, the timing of the spring peak could be related to the sum of degree days since the beginning of the year. Winter abundance was positively correlated to the corresponding temperature. Our results highlight clear patterns in the different sites corresponding to different climates, which allow further forecast of tick seasonality under changing climate conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (&gt;500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (&lt;50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is &lt;90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250- 830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (&gt;10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future.

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOver the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the crucial role of the tick microbiome in tick biology. The soft tick Ornithodoros moubata is a hematophagous ectoparasite of Suidae, best known for transmitting the African swine fever virus. Its bacterial microbiota is characterized by a high prevalence of Francisella-like and Rickettsia endosymbionts. The present study aims to better understand the potential influence of these two major members of the tick microbiota on the reproductive fitness of O. moubata. A total of 132 adult female ticks were treated with antibiotics using gentamycin or rifampicin added to the blood meal. Half of the ticks were also supplemented with B vitamins to address the nutritional role of endosymbionts. Over two periods of 50 days, several traits related to the reproductive fitness were monitored to investigate the importance of Francisella and Rickettsia for these traits. It appeared that most of the reproductive parameters considered were not affected. However, antibiotic treatments induced an increase in the tick survival, indicating a potential fitness cost of harboring endosymbionts during the tick reproductive cycle. Similarly, 366 first stage nymphs of Ornithodoros moubata were exposed to the same treatments for molecular quantification of both endosymbionts. Results from qPCR suggested that the treatments had a bacteriostatic effect on endosymbionts without completely eliminating neither Francisella-like endosymbiont nor Rickettsia.</p>
