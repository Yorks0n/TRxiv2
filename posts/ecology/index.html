This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed. C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data. C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.

R.; Santana, S. E.; Davalos, L. M.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576112\nUnder an adaptive hypothesis, the reciprocal influence between mutualistic plants and frugivores is expected to result in dispersal syndromes comprising both frugivore and plant traits that structure fruit consumption. Tests of this adaptive hypothesis, however, focus on traits of either fruits or frugivores but not both and often ignore within-species variation. To overcome these limitations, we analyze traits for the mutualistic ecological network comprising Carollia bats that feed on and disperse Piper seeds. For these analyses, we use generalized joint attribute modeling (GJAM), a Bayesian modeling approach that simultaneously accounts for multiple sources of variance across trait types. In support of the adaptive hypothesis and indicating niche partitioning among Carollia bats, we find differential consumption of a suite of Piper species influenced by bat traits such as body size; however, Piper morphological traits had no effect on bat consumption. Slow evolutionary rates, dispersal by other vertebrates, and unexamined fruit traits, such as Piper chemical bouquets, may explain the lack of association between bat Piper consumption and fruit morphological traits. We have identified a potential asymmetric influence of frugivore traits on plant-frugivore interactions, providing a template for future trait analyses of plant-animal networks.\nTransoceanic pathogen circulation in the age of sail and steam\nAuthors: Blackmore, E. N.; Lloyd-Smith, J. O.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573813\nIn the centuries following Christopher Columbuss 1492 journey to the Americas, transoceanic voyages opened unprecedented pathways for global pathogen circulation. Yet no biological transfer is a single, discrete event. We use mathematical modeling to quantify historical risk of shipborne pathogen introduction, exploring the respective contributions of journey time, ship size, population susceptibility, transmission intensity, density dependence, and pathogen biology. We contextualize our results using port arrivals data from San Francisco, 1850-1852, and from a selection of historically significant voyages, 1492-1918. We offer numerical estimates of introduction risk across historically-realistic journey times and ship population sizes, and show that steam travel and shipping regimes that involved frequent, large-scale movement of people both substantially increased risk of transoceanic pathogen circulation.\nModelling biological and resource fluxes in fluvial meta-ecosystems\nAuthors: Talluto, M.; del Campo, R.; Estevez, E.; Fuss, T.; Thuile Bistarelli, L.; Martini, J.; Singer, G. A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575367\nMeta-ecosystem theory predicts that cross-ecosystem flows of energy, nutrients, and organisms have important implications for local community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Developments in the theory also have the potential to enhance our under-standing of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Meta-ecosystem theory is particularly well-suited to the study of rivers, because water flow forces strong spatial interrelationships among connected ecosystems. However, models that address flows of both resources and organisms and explicitly link both are lacking. We present a model and associated R-package for cross-ecosystem flows of both resources and organisms that can be used to predict their distribution in river networks, as well as meta-ecosystem functioning. The model incorporates feedbacks between these two crucial components. To illustrate the capabilities of the model, we present an in silico experiment and analysis, as well as providing sample code.\nLiming pasture soils in the Amazon region promotes low-affinity methane oxidation by type I and II methanotrophs\nAuthors: Fonseca de Souza, L.; Nakamura, F. M.; Kroeger, M.; Obregon, D.; de Moraes, M. T.; Vicente, M. G.; Moreira, M. Z.; Pellizari, V. H.; Tsai, S. M.; Nusslein, K.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575838\nIn the Amazon Forest region, cattle pastures are the main land use subsequent to deforestation. This land-use change affects the soil microbial community and methane fluxes, shifting the soil from a methane sink to a source. Soil physical and chemical attributes are changed due to slash-and-burn processes, including an increased soil pH after forest-to-pasture conversion. Without amendments, the pasture soils can become acidic again resulting in many cases in soil degradation. Liming is a standard management practice to increase soil pH while decreasing Al3+ availability. Liming is important to recover these degraded lands and increase soil fertility, but its impact on soil methane cycling in tropical soils is unknown. Here we investigated the role of soil pH on methane uptake under high concentrations of the gas. The top layer of forest (pH 4.1) and adjacent pasture soils (pH 4.8) from the Eastern Amazon were subjected to liming treatment (final pH 5.8) and incubated with [~]10,000 ppm of 13CH4 for 24 days to label DNA with 13C. Soil DNA was evaluated with Stable Isotopic Probing (SIP-DNA), methanotrophic abundance was quantified (pmoA gene), and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed. Liming increased the methane uptake in both forest ([~]10%) and pasture ([~]25%) soils. Methanotrophs Methylocaldum sp. (type I) and Beijerinckaceae (type II) were identified to actively incorporate carbon from methane in limed pasture soils. In limed forest soils, Nitrososphaeraceae, Lysobacter sp., and Acidothermus sp. were identified as 13C-enriched taxa. The enrichment of the archaeal family Nitrososphaeraceae, known as ammonia oxidizers, is correlated with an increase of ammonia monooxygenase genes, which code for an enzyme complex with wide substrate specificity that can also perform methane oxidation. In conclusion, liming Amazonian pasture soils not only contributes to the fertility and recovery of degraded areas but also has the potential to improve the oxidation of methane at high concentrations of this gas.\nBiomechanical properties of defence vibrations produced by bees\nAuthors: Vallejo-Marin, M.; Field, D. L.; Fornoni, J.; Montesinos, D.; Dominguez, C. A.; Baltazar, I.; Vallejo, G. C.; Woodrow, C.; Ayala, R.; Jafferis, N.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575671\nAbstractBees use thoracic vibrations produced by their indirect flight muscles for powering wingbeats in flight, but also during mating, pollination, defence, and nest building. Previous work on non-flight vibrations has mostly focused on acoustic (airborne vibrations) and spectral properties (frequency domain). However, mechanical properties such as the vibrations acceleration amplitude are important in some behaviours, e.g., during buzz pollination, where higher amplitude vibrations remove more pollen from flowers. Bee vibrations have been studied in only a handful of species and we know very little about how they vary among species. Here, we conduct the largest survey to date of the biomechanical properties of non-flight bee buzzes. We focus on defence buzzes as they can be induced experimentally and provide a common currency to compare among taxa. We analysed 15,000 buzzes produced by 306 individuals in 65 species and six families from Mexico, Scotland, and Australia. We found a strong association between body size and the acceleration amplitude of bee buzzes. Comparison of genera that buzz-pollinate and those that do not suggests that buzz-pollinating bees produce vibrations with higher acceleration amplitude. We found no relationship between bee size and the fundamental frequency of defence buzzes. Although our results suggest that body size is a major determinant of the amplitude of non-flight vibrations, we also observed considerable variation in vibration properties among bees of equivalent size and even within individuals. Both morphology and behaviour thus affect the biomechanical properties of non-flight buzzes. Summary statementAnalyses across 65 bee taxa in three continents indicates that body size is a major determinant of the acceleration amplitude but not the oscillation frequency of non-flight thoracic vibrations.\nPervasive sublethal effects of agrochemicals as contributing factors to insect decline\nAuthors: Gandara, L.; Jacoby, R.; Laurent, F.; Spatuzzi, M.; Vlachopoulos, N.; Borst, N. O.; Ekmen, G.; Potel, C. M.; Garrido-Rodriguez, M.; Boehmert, A. L.; Misunou, N.; Bartmanski, B. J.; Li, X. C.; Kutra, D.; Heriche, J.-K.; Tischer, C.; Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, M.; Ingham, V. A.; Savitski, M.; Masson, J.-B.; Zimmermann, M.; Crocker, J.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575373\nInsect biomass is declining across the globe at an alarming rate. Climate change and the widespread use of pesticides have been hypothesized as two underlying drivers. However, the lack of systematic experimental studies across chemicals and species limits our causal understanding of this problem. Here, we employed a chemical library encompassing 1024 different molecules--including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors --to investigate how insect populations are affected by varying concentrations of pesticides, focusing on sublethal doses. Using a controlled laboratory pipeline for Drosophila melanogaster, we found that 57% of these chemicals affect the behavior of larvae at sublethal concentrations, and an even higher proportion compromises long-term survivability after acute exposure. Consistent with these results, we observed that exposure to chemicals at doses orders of magnitude below lethality induced widespread phosphorylation changes across the larval proteome. The effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the ambient temperature was increased by four degrees. We also tested the synergistic effects of multiple chemicals at doses found widely in nature and observed fitness-reducing changes in larval developmental time, behavior, and reproduction. Finally, we expanded our investigation to additional fly species, mosquitos, and butterflies and detected similar behavioral alterations triggered by pesticides at sublethal concentrations. Our results provide experimental evidence that strongly suggests sublethal doses of agrochemicals coupled with changes in environmental temperatures are contributing to the global decline in insect populations. We anticipate that our assays can contribute to improving chemical safety assessment, better protect the environment, secure food supplies, and safeguard animal and human health, as well as understand our rapidly changing world.\nSand flies around Tona, an artificial water reservoir in Bucaramanga (Santander, Colombia): diversity, spatiotemporal frequency, and efficacy of four sampling methods\nAuthors: Rengifo Correa, L.; Castillo, R. M.; Cuadros-Martinez, J.; Galati, E. A. B.; Duque, J. E.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576224\nCharacterizing the sand fly diversity is crucial for an effective design of control strategies for Leishmaniasis. We aimed to characterize the sand fly biodiversity around the Tona Reservoir (Santander, Colombia) and to compare the performance of four sampling methods. A sampling of insects was performed in 2017 in the most preserved and least preserved areas close to the Tona Reservoir, using Torre Vigia-UIS and HomeTrap-UIS, two sticky traps previously designed by our working group, CDC, and Bg-Sentinel traps. We collected 268 Phlebotominae specimens, most with CDC (47.8%) and Torre Vigia-UIS (30.2%) traps. Some specimens (47%) could not be determined because of their preservation status; these samples came mostly from the sticky traps. We found 16 sand fly morphospecies, of which 12 were determined to species level. Here, we report two new records for Santander: Pintomyia youngi (Feliciangeli and Murillo, 1987) and Lutzomyia ceferinoi (Ortiz and Alvarez, 1963). We also collected some confirmed vectors of Leishmania: Pi. youngi, Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu, 1931), and Lu. longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912). The highest diversity was collected in the most disturbed area (15 spp.), and in the rainy season (April, 12 spp.). Pintomyia youngi distribution was broad through the Tona Reservoir in all the sampled periods, and we suggest tracking it to infer leishmaniasis risk in the Tona Reservoir. Torre Vigia-UIS seems a valuable tool for vector control, but we do not recommend it for biodiversity studies.\nIntegrating complexity in population modelling: from matrix to dynamic models using the jellyfish Carybdea marsupialis\nAuthors: Flores-Garcia, A.; Dobson, J. Y.; Fonfria, E. S.; Garcia-Garcia, D.; Bordehore, C.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575756\nMatrix models are widely used in population ecology studies and are valuable for analysing population dynamics. Nonetheless, this approach is somewhat rigid in terms of generating complex scenarios. Starting from the values of the transition matrix, we can build a dynamic model to incorporate more biological-based reality into the model (e.g. polyp stage) and provide a higher flexibility in generating scenarios. As an example, we used the transition matrix calculated for a time series data of a population of the box jellyfish Carybdea marsupialis (L. 1758) in the Western Mediterranean in a previously published study. Dynamic models can help us to better understand the complex relationships that drive populations, test different hypotheses and compare scenarios. The dynamic model was developed in STELLA Architect, calibrated and optimised and it has been used to simulate various scenarios of ecological interest, including a decline in food supply, jellyfish removal strategies, changes in drift currents and changes in substrate availability for planulae to settle. A sensitivity analysis showed that polyp strobilation rate and strobilation pattern were two of the most sensitive variables. This matrix-to-dynamic model approach could be useful to integrate more biological complexity into population models and, in turn, obtain a better fit to the field data.\nAssessing the dynamics of Mycobacterium bovis infection in three French badger populations\nAuthors: Calenge, C.; Payne, A.; Reveillaud, E.; Richomme, C.; Girard, S.; Desvaux, S.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.543041\nThe Sylvatub system is a national surveillance program established in 2011 in France to monitor infections caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the main etiologic agent of bovine tuberculosis, in wild species. This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">O_LIEcological and ecosystem monitoring is rapidly shifting towards using environmental DNA (eDNA) data, particularly in aquatic systems. This approach enables a combined coverage of biodiversity across all major organismal groups and the assessment of ecological indices. Yet, most current approaches are not exploiting the full potential of eDNA data, largely interpreting results in a localized perspective. In riverine networks, by explicitly modelling hydrological transport and associated DNA decay, hydrology-based models enable upscaling eDNA-based diversity information, providing spatially integrated inference. To capitalize from these unprecedented biodiversity data and translate into space-filling biodiversity projections, a streamlined implementation is needed.
C_LIO_LIHere, we introduce the eDITH R-package, implementing the eDITH model to project biodiversity across riverine networks with minimal prior information. eDITH couples a species distribution model relating a local taxons eDNA shedding rate in streamwater to environmental covariates, a mass balance expressing the eDNA concentration at a rivers cross-section as a weighted sum of upstream contributions, and an observational model accounting for uncertainties in eDNA measurements. By leveraging on spatially replicated eDNA measurements and minimal hydromorphological data, eDITH enables disentangling the various upstream eDNA sources, and produces space-filling maps of a taxons spatial distribution at any chosen resolution. eDITH is applicable to both eDNA concentration and metabarcoding data, and to any taxon whose DNA can be retrieved in streamwater.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides user-friendly functions for single-run execution and fitting of eDITH to eDNA data with both Bayesian methods (via the BayesianTools package) and non-linear optimization. An interface to the DHARMa package allows model validation via posterior predictive checks. Necessary preliminary steps such as watershed delineation and hydrological characterization are implemented via the rivnet package. We illustrate eDITHs workflow and functionalities with two case studies from published fish eDNA data.
C_LIO_LIThe eDITH package provides a user-friendly implementation of eDITH, specifically intended for ecologists and conservation biologists. It can be used without previous modelling knowledge but also allows customization for experienced users. Ultimately, eDITH allows upscaling eDNA biodiversity data for any river globally, transforming how state and change of biodiversity in riverine systems can be tracked at high resolution in a highly versatile manner.

        <p class="abstract">Under an adaptive hypothesis, the reciprocal influence between mutualistic plants and frugivores is expected to result in dispersal syndromes comprising both frugivore and plant traits that structure fruit consumption. Tests of this adaptive hypothesis, however, focus on traits of either fruits or frugivores but not both and often ignore within-species variation. To overcome these limitations, we analyze traits for the mutualistic ecological network comprising Carollia bats that feed on and disperse Piper seeds. For these analyses, we use generalized joint attribute modeling (GJAM), a Bayesian modeling approach that simultaneously accounts for multiple sources of variance across trait types. In support of the adaptive hypothesis and indicating niche partitioning among Carollia bats, we find differential consumption of a suite of Piper species influenced by bat traits such as body size; however, Piper morphological traits had no effect on bat consumption. Slow evolutionary rates, dispersal by other vertebrates, and unexamined fruit traits, such as Piper chemical bouquets, may explain the lack of association between bat Piper consumption and fruit morphological traits. We have identified a potential asymmetric influence of frugivore traits on plant-frugivore interactions, providing a template for future trait analyses of plant-animal networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the centuries following Christopher Columbuss 1492 journey to the Americas, transoceanic voyages opened unprecedented pathways for global pathogen circulation. Yet no biological transfer is a single, discrete event. We use mathematical modeling to quantify historical risk of shipborne pathogen introduction, exploring the respective contributions of journey time, ship size, population susceptibility, transmission intensity, density dependence, and pathogen biology. We contextualize our results using port arrivals data from San Francisco, 1850-1852, and from a selection of historically significant voyages, 1492-1918. We offer numerical estimates of introduction risk across historically-realistic journey times and ship population sizes, and show that steam travel and shipping regimes that involved frequent, large-scale movement of people both substantially increased risk of transoceanic pathogen circulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Meta-ecosystem theory predicts that cross-ecosystem flows of energy, nutrients, and organisms have important implications for local community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Developments in the theory also have the potential to enhance our under-standing of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Meta-ecosystem theory is particularly well-suited to the study of rivers, because water flow forces strong spatial interrelationships among connected ecosystems. However, models that address flows of both resources and organisms and explicitly link both are lacking. We present a model and associated R-package for cross-ecosystem flows of both resources and organisms that can be used to predict their distribution in river networks, as well as meta-ecosystem functioning. The model incorporates feedbacks between these two crucial components. To illustrate the capabilities of the model, we present an in silico experiment and analysis, as well as providing sample code.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the Amazon Forest region, cattle pastures are the main land use subsequent to deforestation. This land-use change affects the soil microbial community and methane fluxes, shifting the soil from a methane sink to a source. Soil physical and chemical attributes are changed due to slash-and-burn processes, including an increased soil pH after forest-to-pasture conversion. Without amendments, the pasture soils can become acidic again resulting in many cases in soil degradation. Liming is a standard management practice to increase soil pH while decreasing Al3&#43; availability. Liming is important to recover these degraded lands and increase soil fertility, but its impact on soil methane cycling in tropical soils is unknown. Here we investigated the role of soil pH on methane uptake under high concentrations of the gas. The top layer of forest (pH 4.1) and adjacent pasture soils (pH 4.8) from the Eastern Amazon were subjected to liming treatment (final pH 5.8) and incubated with [~]10,000 ppm of 13CH4 for 24 days to label DNA with 13C. Soil DNA was evaluated with Stable Isotopic Probing (SIP-DNA), methanotrophic abundance was quantified (pmoA gene), and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed. Liming increased the methane uptake in both forest ([~]10%) and pasture ([~]25%) soils. Methanotrophs Methylocaldum sp. (type I) and Beijerinckaceae (type II) were identified to actively incorporate carbon from methane in limed pasture soils. In limed forest soils, Nitrososphaeraceae, Lysobacter sp., and Acidothermus sp. were identified as 13C-enriched taxa. The enrichment of the archaeal family Nitrososphaeraceae, known as ammonia oxidizers, is correlated with an increase of ammonia monooxygenase genes, which code for an enzyme complex with wide substrate specificity that can also perform methane oxidation. In conclusion, liming Amazonian pasture soils not only contributes to the fertility and recovery of degraded areas but also has the potential to improve the oxidation of methane at high concentrations of this gas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractBees use thoracic vibrations produced by their indirect flight muscles for powering wingbeats in flight, but also during mating, pollination, defence, and nest building. Previous work on non-flight vibrations has mostly focused on acoustic (airborne vibrations) and spectral properties (frequency domain). However, mechanical properties such as the vibrations acceleration amplitude are important in some behaviours, e.g., during buzz pollination, where higher amplitude vibrations remove more pollen from flowers. Bee vibrations have been studied in only a handful of species and we know very little about how they vary among species. Here, we conduct the largest survey to date of the biomechanical properties of non-flight bee buzzes. We focus on defence buzzes as they can be induced experimentally and provide a common currency to compare among taxa. We analysed 15,000 buzzes produced by 306 individuals in 65 species and six families from Mexico, Scotland, and Australia. We found a strong association between body size and the acceleration amplitude of bee buzzes. Comparison of genera that buzz-pollinate and those that do not suggests that buzz-pollinating bees produce vibrations with higher acceleration amplitude. We found no relationship between bee size and the fundamental frequency of defence buzzes. Although our results suggest that body size is a major determinant of the amplitude of non-flight vibrations, we also observed considerable variation in vibration properties among bees of equivalent size and even within individuals. Both morphology and behaviour thus affect the biomechanical properties of non-flight buzzes.

Summary statementAnalyses across 65 bee taxa in three continents indicates that body size is a major determinant of the acceleration amplitude but not the oscillation frequency of non-flight thoracic vibrations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insect biomass is declining across the globe at an alarming rate. Climate change and the widespread use of pesticides have been hypothesized as two underlying drivers. However, the lack of systematic experimental studies across chemicals and species limits our causal understanding of this problem. Here, we employed a chemical library encompassing 1024 different molecules--including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors --to investigate how insect populations are affected by varying concentrations of pesticides, focusing on sublethal doses. Using a controlled laboratory pipeline for Drosophila melanogaster, we found that 57% of these chemicals affect the behavior of larvae at sublethal concentrations, and an even higher proportion compromises long-term survivability after acute exposure. Consistent with these results, we observed that exposure to chemicals at doses orders of magnitude below lethality induced widespread phosphorylation changes across the larval proteome. The effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the ambient temperature was increased by four degrees. We also tested the synergistic effects of multiple chemicals at doses found widely in nature and observed fitness-reducing changes in larval developmental time, behavior, and reproduction. Finally, we expanded our investigation to additional fly species, mosquitos, and butterflies and detected similar behavioral alterations triggered by pesticides at sublethal concentrations. Our results provide experimental evidence that strongly suggests sublethal doses of agrochemicals coupled with changes in environmental temperatures are contributing to the global decline in insect populations. We anticipate that our assays can contribute to improving chemical safety assessment, better protect the environment, secure food supplies, and safeguard animal and human health, as well as understand our rapidly changing world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Characterizing the sand fly diversity is crucial for an effective design of control strategies for Leishmaniasis. We aimed to characterize the sand fly biodiversity around the Tona Reservoir (Santander, Colombia) and to compare the performance of four sampling methods. A sampling of insects was performed in 2017 in the most preserved and least preserved areas close to the Tona Reservoir, using Torre Vigia-UIS and HomeTrap-UIS, two sticky traps previously designed by our working group, CDC, and Bg-Sentinel traps. We collected 268 Phlebotominae specimens, most with CDC (47.8%) and Torre Vigia-UIS (30.2%) traps. Some specimens (47%) could not be determined because of their preservation status; these samples came mostly from the sticky traps. We found 16 sand fly morphospecies, of which 12 were determined to species level. Here, we report two new records for Santander: Pintomyia youngi (Feliciangeli and Murillo, 1987) and Lutzomyia ceferinoi (Ortiz and Alvarez, 1963). We also collected some confirmed vectors of Leishmania: Pi. youngi, Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu, 1931), and Lu. longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912). The highest diversity was collected in the most disturbed area (15 spp.), and in the rainy season (April, 12 spp.). Pintomyia youngi distribution was broad through the Tona Reservoir in all the sampled periods, and we suggest tracking it to infer leishmaniasis risk in the Tona Reservoir. Torre Vigia-UIS seems a valuable tool for vector control, but we do not recommend it for biodiversity studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Matrix models are widely used in population ecology studies and are valuable for analysing population dynamics. Nonetheless, this approach is somewhat rigid in terms of generating complex scenarios. Starting from the values of the transition matrix, we can build a dynamic model to incorporate more biological-based reality into the model (e.g. polyp stage) and provide a higher flexibility in generating scenarios. As an example, we used the transition matrix calculated for a time series data of a population of the box jellyfish Carybdea marsupialis (L. 1758) in the Western Mediterranean in a previously published study. Dynamic models can help us to better understand the complex relationships that drive populations, test different hypotheses and compare scenarios. The dynamic model was developed in STELLA Architect, calibrated and optimised and it has been used to simulate various scenarios of ecological interest, including a decline in food supply, jellyfish removal strategies, changes in drift currents and changes in substrate availability for planulae to settle. A sensitivity analysis showed that polyp strobilation rate and strobilation pattern were two of the most sensitive variables. This matrix-to-dynamic model approach could be useful to integrate more biological complexity into population models and, in turn, obtain a better fit to the field data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Sylvatub system is a national surveillance program established in 2011 in France to monitor infections caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the main etiologic agent of bovine tuberculosis, in wild species. This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.</p>
