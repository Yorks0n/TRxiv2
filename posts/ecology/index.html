Climate change and the widespread use of pesticides have been hypothesized as two underlying drivers. However, the lack of systematic experimental studies across chemicals and species limits our causal understanding of this problem. Here, we employed a chemical library encompassing 1024 different molecules (including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors) to investigate how insect populations are affected by varying concentrations of pesticides, focusing on sublethal doses. Using a controlled laboratory pipeline for Drosophila melanogaster, we found that 57% of these chemicals affect the behavior of larvae at sublethal concentrations, and an even higher proportion compromises long-term survivability after acute exposure. Consistent with these results, we observed that exposure to chemicals at doses orders of magnitude below lethality induced widespread phosphorylation changes across the larval proteome. The effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the ambient temperature was increased by four degrees. We also tested the synergistic effects of multiple chemicals at doses found widely in nature and observed fitness-reducing changes in larval developmental time, behavior, and reproduction. Finally, we expanded our investigation to additional fly species, mosquitos, and butterflies and detected similar behavioral alterations triggered by pesticides at sublethal concentrations. Our results provide experimental evidence that strongly suggests sublethal doses of agrochemicals coupled with changes in environmental temperatures are contributing to the global decline in insect populations. We anticipate that our assays can contribute to improving chemical safety assessment, better protect the environment, secure food supplies, and safeguard animal and human health, as well as understand our rapidly changing world.\nStep selection analysis with non-linear and random effects in mgcv\nAuthors: Klappstein, N. J.; Michelot, T.; Fieberg, J.; Pedersen, E. J.; Field, C.; Mills Flemming, J.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574363\nStep selection analysis is used to jointly describe animal movement patterns and habitat preferences. Recent work has extended this framework to model inter-individual differences, account for unexplained structure in animals space use, and capture temporally-varying patterns of movement and habitat selection.In this paper, we formulate step selection functions with penalised smooths (similar to generalised additive models) to unify new and existing extensions, and conveniently implement the models in the popular, open-source mgcv R package. We explore non-linear patterns of movement and habitat selection, and use the equivalence between penalised smoothing splines and random effects to implement individual-level and spatial random effects. This framework can also be used to fit varying-coefficient models to account for temporally or spatially-heterogeneous patterns of selection (e.g., resulting from behavioural variation), or any other non-linear interactions between drivers of the animals movement decisions. We provide the necessary technical details to understand several key special cases of smooths and their implementation in mgcv, showcase the ecological relevance using two illustrative examples, and provide R code (available at https://github.com/NJKlappstein/smoothSSF) to facilitate the adoption of these methods. This paper is a broad overview of how smooth effects can be applied to increase the flexibility and biological realism of step selection analysis.\nTaking identity-by-descent analysis into the wild: Estimating realized relatedness in free-ranging macaques\nAuthors: Freudiger, A.; Jovanovic, V.

L.; Ruiz-Lambides, A.; Tung, J.; Nowick, K.; Ringbauer, H.; Widdig, A.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574911\nBiological relatedness is a key consideration in studies of behavior, population structure, and trait evolution. Except for parent-offspring dyads, pedigrees capture relatedness imperfectly. The number and length of DNA segments that are identical-by-descent (IBD) yield the most precise estimates of relatedness. Here, we leverage novel methods for estimating locus-specific IBD from low coverage whole genome resequencing data to demonstrate the feasibility and value of resolving fine-scaled gradients of relatedness in free-living animals. Using primarily 4-6x coverage data from a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with available long-term pedigree data, we show that we can call the number and length of IBD segments across the genome with high accuracy even at 0.5x coverage. The resulting estimates demonstrate substantial variation in genetic relatedness within kin classes, leading to overlapping distributions between kin classes. They identify cryptic genetic relatives that are not represented in the pedigree and reveal elevated recombination rates in females relative to males, which allows us to discriminate maternal and paternal kin using genotype data alone. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the ability to understand the predictors and consequences of genetic relatedness in natural populations, contributing to our understanding of a fundamental component of population structure in the wild.\nEvaluating key evidence and formulating regulatory alternatives regarding the UK Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill\nAuthors: Challender, D.; 't Sas-Rolfes, M.; Dickman, A.; Hare, D.; Hart, A.; Hoffmann, M.; Mallon, D.; Mandisodza-Chikerema, R.; Roe, D.\nScore: 124.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544826\nPublic policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as \"trophy hunting\" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.\nSeasonal dynamics and drivers of microbial communities in a temperate dimictic lake: insights from metabarcoding and machine learning\nAuthors: Karlicki, M.; Bednarska, A.; Halakuc, P.; Maciszewski, K.; Karnkowska, A.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575328\nMicrobial communities, consisting of prokaryotes and protists, play a central role in ecological processes in aquatic environments. To understand these communities, metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to assess their taxonomic composition and to track spatio-temporal dynamics in both marine and freshwater environments. While previous research has primarily focused on marine ecosystems, it is important to study microbial communities in freshwater environments, which are characterised by high diversity and susceptibility to rapid environmental change. In temperate lakes, despite extensive research on temporal changes in physico-chemical factors and microscopic studies of plankton, there is a notable research gap regarding their eukaryotic microbial communities. Our study fills this gap by investigating the diversity and seasonal changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in Lake Ro[s] (Poland), a representative temperate lake characterised by two mixing episodes in spring and autumn and pronounced stratification in summer. Our metabarcoding analysis revealed that both the bacterial and protist communities exhibit distinct seasonal patterns that are not necessarily shaped by dominant taxa. To decipher the drivers of the seasonal communities, we used machine learning and statistical methods and identified crucial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) specific to each season. In addition, we identified a distinct community in the anoxic hypolimnion. We have also shown that the key factors shaping the community composition in Lake Ro[s] are temperature, oxygen and silicon concentration. Understanding these community structures and the underlying factors is crucial in the context of climate change, which might affect mixing patterns and lead to prolonged stratification. Given the pronounced seasonal shifts observed in these communities, we can anticipate that climate change will profoundly impact the functioning of temperate dimictic lakes.\nBiomechanical properties of defence vibrations produced by bees\nAuthors: Vallejo-Marin, M.; Field, D. L.; Fornoni, J.; Montesinos, D.; Dominguez, C. A.; Baltazar, I.; Vallejo, G. C.; Woodrow, C.; Ayala, R.; Jafferis, N.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575671\nBees use thoracic vibrations produced by their indirect flight muscles for powering wingbeats in flight, but also during mating, pollination, defence, and nest building. Previous work on non-flight vibrations has mostly focused on acoustic (airborne vibrations) and spectral properties (frequency domain). However, mechanical properties such as the vibration's acceleration amplitude are important in some behaviours, e.g., during buzz pollination, where higher amplitude vibrations remove more pollen from flowers. Bee vibrations have been studied in only a handful of species and we know very little about how they vary among species. Here, we conduct the largest survey to date of the biomechanical properties of non-flight bee buzzes. We focus on defence buzzes as they can be induced experimentally and provide a common currency to compare among taxa. We analysed 15,000 buzzes produced by 306 individuals in 65 species and six families from Mexico, Scotland, and Australia. We found a strong association between body size and the acceleration amplitude of bee buzzes. Comparison of genera that buzz-pollinate and those that do not suggests that buzz-pollinating bees produce vibrations with higher acceleration amplitude. We found no relationship between bee size and the fundamental frequency of defence buzzes. Although our results suggest that body size is a major determinant of the amplitude of non-flight vibrations, we also observed considerable variation in vibration properties among bees of equivalent size and even within individuals. Both morphology and behaviour thus affect the biomechanical properties of non-flight buzzes.\nA multi-host mechanistic model of African swine fever emergence and control in Romania\nAuthors: Hayes, B. H.; Vergne, T.; Rose, N.; Mortasivu, C.; Andraud, M.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574784\nAfrican swine fever (ASF) has devastating effects on swine production, farmer livelihood, animal welfare, and biodiversity. Extremely difficult to control, epidemic management is further complicated when spillover between domestic pig and wild boar populations is suspected. To quantify ASF viral transmission between domestic pigs and wild boar, a spatially-explicit stochastic mechanistic model was constructed using village centroids to represent aggregated backyard pig herds and a hexagonal raster of forest coverage to represent wild boar abundance. The model was parameterized to the initial six months of the ongoing Romanian epidemic through approximate Bayesian computation. It was estimated that a median of 69.4% (interquartile range: 53.0-80.0%) of domestic pig herd cases came from other infected domestic pig herds while 20.4% (11.2-33.8%) originated from infected wild boar sources, and 8.4% (4.7-14.2%) stemmed from external sources not explicitly represented. Also, 31.9% of infected wild boar habitat (16.7-56.2%) originated from domestic pig herds and 68.1% (43.8-83.3%) came from neighboring infected wild boar populations. Furthermore, it was found that habitats with a forest coverage greater than 15% were 2.6 times more infectious and 5.3 times more susceptible than other habitats. All alternative control scenarios, including culling domestic pig herds upon local domestic pig or wild boar case detection, improved epidemic outcomes, with the greatest decrease in final epidemic size being observed from the reactive culling of entire villages following case detection. These results can be used to further inform policy recommendations in ASF-epidemic regions. Significance StatementThe current African swine fever (ASF) pandemic is devastating to affected nations, and quantifying transmission parameters is critical to informing control strategies. Disease spillover between wild and domestic hosts further complicates control efforts, yet the influence of spillover events on epidemic propagation remains unknown. Using the context of Romania--one of the European nations with the most severe epidemic and where spillover transmission is strongly suspected--we show that targeting spillover mechanisms is critical for achieving holistic disease control, and then demonstrate the impact of alternative control scenarios had they been enacted. These results can inform control strategy policy decisions in the many nations at-risk for or actively experiencing ASF epidemics.\nNeutral speciation in realistic populations\nAuthors: Nelson, E. D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575124\nde Aguiar et al. have shown that basic patterns of species diversity found in nature can be described by a simple neutral model of speciation in which species emerge as a consequence of local mating and mate preference for genetic similarity. Their results have been cited as support for the neutral theory of biodiversity. However, because the mutation rates considered in their work are much larger than those experienced by living organisms, there is still some question as to whether speciation will occur in the neutral model under realistic conditions. Here, I develop a variant of the neutral model that includes a realistic mechanism for organism dispersal. I explore speciation in the model for a class of mobile organisms (butterflies), and I find that speciation does occur under conditions consistent with butterfly populations, albeit on narrow landscapes. The model also appears to exhibit scaling behavior -- specifically, if the model is \"scaled up\" by increasing the area of the landscape while holding its length to width ratio and population density constant, the number of species tends to an asymptotic value. The results suggest that it is possible to infer speciation patterns in large populations by simulating much smaller, computationally tractable populations.\nLarge language models help facilitate the automated synthesis of information on potential pest controllers\nAuthors: Scheepens, D.; Millard, J.; Farrell, M.; Newbold, T.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575330\nThe body of ecological literature, which informs much of our knowledge of the global loss of biodiversity, has been experiencing rapid growth in recent decades. The increasing difficulty to synthesise this literature manually has simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text mining methods. Within the domain of deep learning, large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years by virtue of great leaps in progress and a wide range of potential applications, however, quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of GPT-4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest controllers from abstracts of a body of literature on biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero-shot prompt. Our results show that the performance of GPT-4 is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art tools used for taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location extraction tasks. On a held-out test set, we show that species and geographic locations are extracted with F1-scores of 99.8% and 95.3%, respectively, and highlight that the model is able to distinguish very effectively between the primary roles of interest (predators, parasitoids and pests). Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the model to effectively extract and predict taxonomic information across various taxonomic ranks, and to automatically correct spelling mistakes. However, we do report a small number of cases of fabricated information (hallucinations). As a result of the current lack of specialised, pre-trained ecological language models, general-purpose LLMs may provide a promising way forward in ecology. Combined with tailored prompt engineering, such models can be employed for a wide range of text mining tasks in ecology, with the potential to greatly reduce time spent on manual screening and labelling of the literature.\nRevisiting the invasion paradox: resistance-richness relationship is driven by augmentation and displacement trends\nAuthors: Zhu, Y.; Momeni, B.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575455\nHost-associated resident microbiota can protect their host from pathogen, a community-level trait called colonization resistance. The effect of the diversity of the resident community in previous studies has shown contradictory results, with higher diversity either strengthening or weakening colonization resistance. To control the confounding factors that may lead to such contradictions, we use mathematical simulations that focus on species interactions and their impact on colonization resistance. We use a mediator-explicit model that accounts for metabolite-mediated interactions to perform in silico invasion experiments. Our results state that colonization resistance often does not have a monotonic relationship with the species richness of the resident community. Instead, colonization outcomes are often the consequence of two underlying trends as the richness of the resident community increases: a decrease in instances of augmentation (invader species added, without driving out resident species) and an increase in instances of displacement (invader species added, driving out some of the resident species). We observe these two underlying trends hold consistently under different parameters, regardless of the number of compounds that mediate interactions between species or the proportion of the facilitative versus inhibitory interactions among species. Our results provide an explanation for the seemingly contradictory trend in the resistance-diversity relationship in previous reports.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Insect biomass is declining across the globe at an alarming rate. Climate change and the widespread use of pesticides have been hypothesized as two underlying drivers. However, the lack of systematic experimental studies across chemicals and species limits our causal understanding of this problem. Here, we employed a chemical library encompassing 1024 different molecules (including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors) to investigate how insect populations are affected by varying concentrations of pesticides, focusing on sublethal doses. Using a controlled laboratory pipeline for Drosophila melanogaster, we found that 57% of these chemicals affect the behavior of larvae at sublethal concentrations, and an even higher proportion compromises long-term survivability after acute exposure. Consistent with these results, we observed that exposure to chemicals at doses orders of magnitude below lethality induced widespread phosphorylation changes across the larval proteome. The effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the ambient temperature was increased by four degrees. We also tested the synergistic effects of multiple chemicals at doses found widely in nature and observed fitness-reducing changes in larval developmental time, behavior, and reproduction. Finally, we expanded our investigation to additional fly species, mosquitos, and butterflies and detected similar behavioral alterations triggered by pesticides at sublethal concentrations. Our results provide experimental evidence that strongly suggests sublethal doses of agrochemicals coupled with changes in environmental temperatures are contributing to the global decline in insect populations. We anticipate that our assays can contribute to improving chemical safety assessment, better protect the environment, secure food supplies, and safeguard animal and human health, as well as understand our rapidly changing world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Step selection analysis is used to jointly describe animal movement patterns and habitat preferences. Recent work has extended this framework to model inter-individual differences, account for unexplained structure in animals space use, and capture temporally-varying patterns of movement and habitat selection.In this paper, we formulate step selection functions with penalised smooths (similar to generalised additive models) to unify new and existing extensions, and conveniently implement the models in the popular, open-source mgcv R package. We explore non-linear patterns of movement and habitat selection, and use the equivalence between penalised smoothing splines and random effects to implement individual-level and spatial random effects. This framework can also be used to fit varying-coefficient models to account for temporally or spatially-heterogeneous patterns of selection (e.g., resulting from behavioural variation), or any other non-linear interactions between drivers of the animals movement decisions. We provide the necessary technical details to understand several key special cases of smooths and their implementation in mgcv, showcase the ecological relevance using two illustrative examples, and provide R code (available at https://github.com/NJKlappstein/smoothSSF) to facilitate the adoption of these methods. This paper is a broad overview of how smooth effects can be applied to increase the flexibility and biological realism of step selection analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological relatedness is a key consideration in studies of behavior, population structure, and trait evolution. Except for parent-offspring dyads, pedigrees capture relatedness imperfectly. The number and length of DNA segments that are identical-by-descent (IBD) yield the most precise estimates of relatedness. Here, we leverage novel methods for estimating locus-specific IBD from low coverage whole genome resequencing data to demonstrate the feasibility and value of resolving fine-scaled gradients of relatedness in free-living animals. Using primarily 4-6x coverage data from a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population with available long-term pedigree data, we show that we can call the number and length of IBD segments across the genome with high accuracy even at 0.5x coverage. The resulting estimates demonstrate substantial variation in genetic relatedness within kin classes, leading to overlapping distributions between kin classes. They identify cryptic genetic relatives that are not represented in the pedigree and reveal elevated recombination rates in females relative to males, which allows us to discriminate maternal and paternal kin using genotype data alone. Our findings represent a breakthrough in the ability to understand the predictors and consequences of genetic relatedness in natural populations, contributing to our understanding of a fundamental component of population structure in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Public policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as &#34;trophy hunting&#34; is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {&#43;/-} 66.53 (mean {&#43;/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {&#43;/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial communities, consisting of prokaryotes and protists, play a central role in ecological processes in aquatic environments. To understand these communities, metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to assess their taxonomic composition and to track spatio-temporal dynamics in both marine and freshwater environments. While previous research has primarily focused on marine ecosystems, it is important to study microbial communities in freshwater environments, which are characterised by high diversity and susceptibility to rapid environmental change. In temperate lakes, despite extensive research on temporal changes in physico-chemical factors and microscopic studies of plankton, there is a notable research gap regarding their eukaryotic microbial communities. Our study fills this gap by investigating the diversity and seasonal changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in Lake Ro[s] (Poland), a representative temperate lake characterised by two mixing episodes in spring and autumn and pronounced stratification in summer. Our metabarcoding analysis revealed that both the bacterial and protist communities exhibit distinct seasonal patterns that are not necessarily shaped by dominant taxa. To decipher the drivers of the seasonal communities, we used machine learning and statistical methods and identified crucial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) specific to each season. In addition, we identified a distinct community in the anoxic hypolimnion. We have also shown that the key factors shaping the community composition in Lake Ro[s] are temperature, oxygen and silicon concentration. Understanding these community structures and the underlying factors is crucial in the context of climate change, which might affect mixing patterns and lead to prolonged stratification. Given the pronounced seasonal shifts observed in these communities, we can anticipate that climate change will profoundly impact the functioning of temperate dimictic lakes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bees use thoracic vibrations produced by their indirect flight muscles for powering wingbeats in flight, but also during mating, pollination, defence, and nest building. Previous work on non-flight vibrations has mostly focused on acoustic (airborne vibrations) and spectral properties (frequency domain). However, mechanical properties such as the vibration&#39;s acceleration amplitude are important in some behaviours, e.g., during buzz pollination, where higher amplitude vibrations remove more pollen from flowers. Bee vibrations have been studied in only a handful of species and we know very little about how they vary among species. Here, we conduct the largest survey to date of the biomechanical properties of non-flight bee buzzes. We focus on defence buzzes as they can be induced experimentally and provide a common currency to compare among taxa. We analysed 15,000 buzzes produced by 306 individuals in 65 species and six families from Mexico, Scotland, and Australia. We found a strong association between body size and the acceleration amplitude of bee buzzes. Comparison of genera that buzz-pollinate and those that do not suggests that buzz-pollinating bees produce vibrations with higher acceleration amplitude. We found no relationship between bee size and the fundamental frequency of defence buzzes. Although our results suggest that body size is a major determinant of the amplitude of non-flight vibrations, we also observed considerable variation in vibration properties among bees of equivalent size and even within individuals. Both morphology and behaviour thus affect the biomechanical properties of non-flight buzzes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">African swine fever (ASF) has devastating effects on swine production, farmer livelihood, animal welfare, and biodiversity. Extremely difficult to control, epidemic management is further complicated when spillover between domestic pig and wild boar populations is suspected. To quantify ASF viral transmission between domestic pigs and wild boar, a spatially-explicit stochastic mechanistic model was constructed using village centroids to represent aggregated backyard pig herds and a hexagonal raster of forest coverage to represent wild boar abundance. The model was parameterized to the initial six months of the ongoing Romanian epidemic through approximate Bayesian computation. It was estimated that a median of 69.4% (interquartile range: 53.0-80.0%) of domestic pig herd cases came from other infected domestic pig herds while 20.4% (11.2-33.8%) originated from infected wild boar sources, and 8.4% (4.7-14.2%) stemmed from external sources not explicitly represented. Also, 31.9% of infected wild boar habitat (16.7-56.2%) originated from domestic pig herds and 68.1% (43.8-83.3%) came from neighboring infected wild boar populations. Furthermore, it was found that habitats with a forest coverage greater than 15% were 2.6 times more infectious and 5.3 times more susceptible than other habitats. All alternative control scenarios, including culling domestic pig herds upon local domestic pig or wild boar case detection, improved epidemic outcomes, with the greatest decrease in final epidemic size being observed from the reactive culling of entire villages following case detection. These results can be used to further inform policy recommendations in ASF-epidemic regions.

Significance StatementThe current African swine fever (ASF) pandemic is devastating to affected nations, and quantifying transmission parameters is critical to informing control strategies. Disease spillover between wild and domestic hosts further complicates control efforts, yet the influence of spillover events on epidemic propagation remains unknown. Using the context of Romania--one of the European nations with the most severe epidemic and where spillover transmission is strongly suspected--we show that targeting spillover mechanisms is critical for achieving holistic disease control, and then demonstrate the impact of alternative control scenarios had they been enacted. These results can inform control strategy policy decisions in the many nations at-risk for or actively experiencing ASF epidemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">de Aguiar et al. have shown that basic patterns of species diversity found in nature can be described by a simple neutral model of speciation in which species emerge as a consequence of local mating and mate preference for genetic similarity. Their results have been cited as support for the neutral theory of biodiversity. However, because the mutation rates considered in their work are much larger than those experienced by living organisms, there is still some question as to whether speciation will occur in the neutral model under realistic conditions. Here, I develop a variant of the neutral model that includes a realistic mechanism for organism dispersal. I explore speciation in the model for a class of mobile organisms (butterflies), and I find that speciation does occur under conditions consistent with butterfly populations, albeit on narrow landscapes. The model also appears to exhibit scaling behavior -- specifically, if the model is &#34;scaled up&#34; by increasing the area of the landscape while holding its length to width ratio and population density constant, the number of species tends to an asymptotic value. The results suggest that it is possible to infer speciation patterns in large populations by simulating much smaller, computationally tractable populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The body of ecological literature, which informs much of our knowledge of the global loss of biodiversity, has been experiencing rapid growth in recent decades. The increasing difficulty to synthesise this literature manually has simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text mining methods. Within the domain of deep learning, large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years by virtue of great leaps in progress and a wide range of potential applications, however, quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of GPT-4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest controllers from abstracts of a body of literature on biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero-shot prompt. Our results show that the performance of GPT-4 is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art tools used for taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location extraction tasks. On a held-out test set, we show that species and geographic locations are extracted with F1-scores of 99.8% and 95.3%, respectively, and highlight that the model is able to distinguish very effectively between the primary roles of interest (predators, parasitoids and pests). Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the model to effectively extract and predict taxonomic information across various taxonomic ranks, and to automatically correct spelling mistakes. However, we do report a small number of cases of fabricated information (hallucinations). As a result of the current lack of specialised, pre-trained ecological language models, general-purpose LLMs may provide a promising way forward in ecology. Combined with tailored prompt engineering, such models can be employed for a wide range of text mining tasks in ecology, with the potential to greatly reduce time spent on manual screening and labelling of the literature.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Host-associated resident microbiota can protect their host from pathogen, a community-level trait called colonization resistance. The effect of the diversity of the resident community in previous studies has shown contradictory results, with higher diversity either strengthening or weakening colonization resistance. To control the confounding factors that may lead to such contradictions, we use mathematical simulations that focus on species interactions and their impact on colonization resistance. We use a mediator-explicit model that accounts for metabolite-mediated interactions to perform in silico invasion experiments. Our results state that colonization resistance often does not have a monotonic relationship with the species richness of the resident community. Instead, colonization outcomes are often the consequence of two underlying trends as the richness of the resident community increases: a decrease in instances of augmentation (invader species added, without driving out resident species) and an increase in instances of displacement (invader species added, driving out some of the resident species). We observe these two underlying trends hold consistently under different parameters, regardless of the number of compounds that mediate interactions between species or the proportion of the facilitative versus inhibitory interactions among species. Our results provide an explanation for the seemingly contradictory trend in the resistance-diversity relationship in previous reports.</p>
