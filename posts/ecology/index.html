While soil microbes undoubtedly play an important role in soil organic carbon cycling, we are concerned about the robustness of the approach taken by Tao et al.

E.; Lukas, J.; Sevinchan, Y.; Krause, J.; Arias-Rodriguez, L.; Bierbach, D.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550037\nThe thermal ecology of ectotherm animals has gained considerable attention in the face of human induced climate change. Particularly in aquatic species the experimental assessment of critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) may help to predict possible effects of global warming on habitat suitability and ultimately species survival. Here we present data on the thermal limits of two endemic and endangered extremophile fish species, inhabiting a geothermally-heated and sulfur-rich spring system in Southern Mexico: The sulfur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria) and the widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma). Besides physiological challenges induced by toxic hydrogen sulfide and related severe hypoxia during the day, water temperatures have been previously reported to exceed those of nearby clearwater streams. We now present temperature data for various locations and years in the sulphur spring complex and conducted laboratory thermal tolerance tests (CTmin and CTmax) both under normoxic as well as sever hypoxic conditions in both species. Average CTmax limits did not differ between species under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly P. sulphuraria was found to reach a higher critical temperature (CTmax = 43.2{degrees}C) when tested under hypoxic conditions, while G. eurystoma on average had a lower CTmax when oxygen was absent. Based on this data we calculated both species thermal safety margins and used a TDT (thermal death time) model framework to relate our experimental data to observed temperatures in the natural habitat. Our findings suggest, that both species live near their thermal limits during the annual dry season and are locally already exposed to temperatures above their critical thermal limits. We discuss these findings in the light of possible physiological adaptions of the sulfur-adapted fish species and the anthropogenic threats for this unique system.\ntidysdm: leveraging the flexibility of tidymodels for Species Distribution Modelling in R\nAuthors: Leonardi, M.; Colucci, M.; Manica, A.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550358\nIn species distribution modelling (SDM), it is common practice to explore multiple machine-learning algorithms and combine their results into ensembles. This is no easy task in R: different algorithms were developed independently, with inconsistent syntax and data structures. Specialised SDM packages integrate multiple algorithms by creating a complex interface between the user (providing a unified input and receiving a unified output), and the back-end code (that tackles the specific needs depending on the algorithm). This requires a lot of work to create and maintain the right interface, and it prevents an easy integration of other methods that may become available. Here we present tidysdm, an R package that solves this problem by taking advantage of the tidymodels universe. Being part of the tidyverse, (i) it has standardised grammar and data structures providing a coherent interface for modelling, (ii) includes packages designed for fitting, tuning, and validating various models, and (iii) allows easy integration of new algorithms and methods. tidysdm allows easy, flexible and quick species distribution modelling by supporting standard algorithms, including additional SDM-oriented functions, and giving the opportunity of using any algorithm or procedure to fit, tune and validate a large number of different models. Additionally, it provides further functions to easily fit models based on paleo/time-scattered data. The package includes two vignettes detailing standard procedures for present-day and time-scattered data. These vignettes also showcase the integration with pastclim (Leonardi et al. 2023) to allow easier access to palaeoclimatic data series, if needed, but users can bring in their own climatic data in standard formats.\nSources of prey availability data alter interpretation of outputs from prey choice null networks\nAuthors: Cuff, J. P.; Tercel, M. P.; Windsor, F. M.; Hawthorne, B. S.; Hamback, P. A.; Bell, J. R.; Symondson, W. O.; Vaughan, I. P.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.549927\nO_LINull models provide an invaluable baseline against which to test fundamental ecological hypotheses and highlight patterns in foraging choices that cannot be explained by neutral processes or sampling artefacts. In this way, null models can advance our understanding beyond simplistic dietary descriptions to identify drivers of interactions. This method, however, requires estimates of resource availability, which are generally imperfect representations of highly dynamic systems. Optimising method selection is crucial for study design, but the precise effects of different resource availability data on the efficacy of null models are poorly understood. C_LIO_LIUsing spider-prey networks as a model, we used prey abundance (suction sample) and activity density (sticky trap) data, and combinations of the two, to simulate null networks. We compared null diet composition, network properties (e.g., connectance and nestedness) and deviations of simulations from metabarcoding-based spider dietary data (to ascertain how different prey availability data alter ecological interpretation. C_LIO_LIDifferent sampling methods produced different null networks and inferred distinct prey selectivity. Null networks based on prey abundance and combined frequency-of-occurrence data more closely resembled the observed diet composition, and those based on prey abundance, activity density and proportionally combined data generated network properties most like dietary metabarcoding networks. C_LIO_LIWe show that survey method choice impacts all aspects of null network analyses, the precise effects varying between methods but ultimately altering ecological interpretation by increasing disparity in network properties or trophic niches between null and directly constructed networks. Merging datasets can generate more complete prey availability data but is not a panacea because it introduces different biases. The choice of method should reflect the research hypotheses and study system being investigated. Ultimately, survey methods should emulate the foraging mode of the focal predator as closely as possible, informed by the known ecology, natural history and behaviour of the predator.

Computational and lab-scaled experiments [2, 3, 4] have suggested that information about the source distance may be encoded in odor signal statistics, yet it is unclear whether useful and continuous distance estimates can be made under real-world flow conditions. Here we analyze odor signals from outdoor experiments with a sensor moving across large spatial scales in desert and forest environments to show that odor signal statistics can yield useful estimates of distance. The probability distribution of statistics from individual whiffs (contiguous odor sequences) are correlated with distance, but their correlation coefficient is poor. However, we show that a useful estimate of distance can be found by incorporating whiff statistics from time history of [~]10-seconds, resulting in a strong correlation of R2 [~]0.70. We identified whiff concentration and duration to be the most informative features. By combining distance estimates from a linear model with wind-relative motion dynamics, we were able to estimate source distance in a 60x60 m2 area with median errors of 3-8 meters, a distance at which point odor sources are within visual range for animals such as mosquitoes [5, 6]. Finally, we show that such estimates are only feasible if odor signal information is recorded at temporal resolutions of[\u0026ge;] 20 Hz. Together, our results provide a compelling case for how odor signal statistics could be used by animals, or man-made machines, to optimize plume tracking decisions at large spatial scales with natural wind.\nStructured demographic buffering: A framework to explore the environment drivers and demographic mechanisms underlying demographic buffering\nAuthors: Gascoigne, S.

Decades of work exploring how environmental stochasticity influences population dynamics have highlighted the ability of some natural populations to limit the negative effects of environmental stochasticity, one of these strategies being demographic buffering. Whilst various methods exist to quantify demographic buffering, we still do not know which environment factors and demographic characteristics are most responsible for the demographic buffering observed in natural populations. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the relative effects of three key drivers of demographic buffering: environment components (e.g., temporal autocorrelation and variance), population structure, and demographic rates (e.g., progression and fertility). Using Integral Projection Models, we explore how these drivers impact the demographic buffering abilities of three plant species with different life histories and demonstrate how our approach successfully characterises a populations capacity to demographically buffer against environmental stochasticity in a changing world.\nField margins as substitute habitat for the conservation of birds in agricultural wetlands\nAuthors: Mallet, P.; Bechet, A.; Sirami, C.; Mesleard, F.; Blanchon, T.; Calatayud, F.; Dagonet, T.; Gaget, E.; Leray, C.; Galewski, T.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2022.05.05.490780\nBreeding birds in agricultural landscapes have declined considerably since the 1950s and the beginning of agricultural intensification in Europe. Given the increasing pressure on agricultural land, it is necessary to identify conservation measures that consume little productive land. We tested the compensation hypothesis which states that field margins may represent substitute habitats for bird species in agricultural wetlands. We monitored bird species in 86 crop fields in rice paddy landscapes of Camargue (southern France), a wetland of international importance for birds. We investigated whether the area of three types of field margins (reed strips, grass strips and hedgerows) within a 500 meter buffer around the centroid of each crop fields had an effect on the abundance of bird species from three groups defined based on their primary habitat (reedbeds, grasslands, and forest edge species). We controlled for the area of each type of semi-natural habitat (wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands), crop diversity (rice, wheat, alfalfa, rape, and market gardening) and mean crop field size. Results show partial support of the compensation hypothesis with species-dependent responses to primary and substitute habitat area. Some species within the reedbed and grassland bird guilds are favored by the area of their primary habitat as well as by the area of field margins, in line with the compensation hypothesis. Eurasian reed warbler is favored by the area of both wetlands and reed strips. Corn bunting is favored by grassland and grass strip areas. We could not confirm the compensation hypothesis for other species. However, this may be due to the fact that most of these species did not respond to their primary habitat. These results therefore suggest that field margins may represent substitute habitats for some species but further studies, in contexts where species are strongly associated with their primary habitat, would be needed to confirm the generality of this hypothesis. Our results also suggest that species response to increasing the area of a field margin type may vary among guilds and even within guilds. Therefore, it may be difficult to favor all species within a given landscape and management actions may need to be tailored to whichever species are locally associated with the highest conservation priority. To tackle this challenge, it may be necessary to design landscape management actions at different spatial scales.\nFungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana - Diversity, functions, and publicly available cultures for experimental exploration\nAuthors: Estermann, A. H.; Teixeira Pereira Bassiardis, J.; Loos, A.; Solbach, M. D.; Bonkowski, M.; Hess, S.; Dumack, K.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548669\nIn the context of the soil food web, the transfer of plant-fixed energy and carbon to higher trophic levels has traditionally been attributed to two main energy channels: the fungal energy channel and the bacterial energy channel. Historically, protists were overlooked in the fungal energy channel, which was believed to be controlled by fungivorous microarthropods and nematodes. In this study, we investigated fungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings revealed a notable abundance and diversity of protists that have developed specialized strategies to overcome the protective cell wall of fungi. Among the identified species were two Vampyrellida (Rhizaria) species, namely Theratromyxa weberi and Platyreta germanica, as well as one Arcellinida (Amoebozoa) species, called Cryptodifflugia oviformis. While T. weberi typically consumed entire fungal cells, the other two species perforated fungal cell walls and extracted the cellular contents. We elucidate the feeding strategies and dietary ranges of the amoebae, highlighting the non-uniform nature of fungivory in protists, as different taxa have evolved distinct approaches to access fungi as a food source. Moreover, we provide publicly available cultures of these protists to facilitate further experimental investigations within the research community.\nCoupling remote sensing and eDNA to monitor environmental impact: A pilot to quantify the environmental benefits of sustainable agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon\nAuthors: Dyson, K.; Nicolau, A.

Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificacao Florestal e Agricola (IMAFLORA) near Sao Felix do Xingu, in Para, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called TerraBio. Our results suggest that, due to IMAFLORAs shaded cocoa projects, over 400 acres were restored in the intervention area and the community composition of arthropods in shaded cocoa is closer to second-growth forests than that of pastures. In reviewing the coupled approach, we found multiple aspects worked well, and we conclude by presenting multiple lessons learned.\nThe ecological consequences of microbial metabolic strategies in fluctuating environments\nAuthors: Wang, Z.; Goyal, A.; Maslov, S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550395\nMicrobes adopt a variety of metabolic strategies to consume resources in fluctuating environments, but most work has focused on understanding these strategies in the context of isolated species, rather than diverse natural communities. We systematically measure the feasibility, dynamical and structural stability of multispecies microbial communities adopting different metabolic strategies. Our results reveal key distinctions between the ecological properties of different metabolic strategies, showing that communities containing sequential utilizers are more resilient to resource fluctuations, but are less feasible than co-utilizing communities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In a recently published paper (1), the authors report that microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is the primary determinant of global soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and that the relative impact of plant carbon inputs on SOC is minor. While soil microbes undoubtedly play an important role in soil organic carbon cycling, we are concerned about the robustness of the approach taken by Tao et al. (1) and highlight potential biases in their analyses that may lead to misleading, model-dependent results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The thermal ecology of ectotherm animals has gained considerable attention in the face of human induced climate change. Particularly in aquatic species the experimental assessment of critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) may help to predict possible effects of global warming on habitat suitability and ultimately species survival. Here we present data on the thermal limits of two endemic and endangered extremophile fish species, inhabiting a geothermally-heated and sulfur-rich spring system in Southern Mexico: The sulfur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria) and the widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma). Besides physiological challenges induced by toxic hydrogen sulfide and related severe hypoxia during the day, water temperatures have been previously reported to exceed those of nearby clearwater streams. We now present temperature data for various locations and years in the sulphur spring complex and conducted laboratory thermal tolerance tests (CTmin and CTmax) both under normoxic as well as sever hypoxic conditions in both species. Average CTmax limits did not differ between species under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly P. sulphuraria was found to reach a higher critical temperature (CTmax = 43.2{degrees}C) when tested under hypoxic conditions, while G. eurystoma on average had a lower CTmax when oxygen was absent. Based on this data we calculated both species thermal safety margins and used a TDT (thermal death time) model framework to relate our experimental data to observed temperatures in the natural habitat. Our findings suggest, that both species live near their thermal limits during the annual dry season and are locally already exposed to temperatures above their critical thermal limits. We discuss these findings in the light of possible physiological adaptions of the sulfur-adapted fish species and the anthropogenic threats for this unique system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In species distribution modelling (SDM), it is common practice to explore multiple machine-learning algorithms and combine their results into ensembles. This is no easy task in R: different algorithms were developed independently, with inconsistent syntax and data structures. Specialised SDM packages integrate multiple algorithms by creating a complex interface between the user (providing a unified input and receiving a unified output), and the back-end code (that tackles the specific needs depending on the algorithm). This requires a lot of work to create and maintain the right interface, and it prevents an easy integration of other methods that may become available.

Here we present tidysdm, an R package that solves this problem by taking advantage of the tidymodels universe. Being part of the tidyverse, (i) it has standardised grammar and data structures providing a coherent interface for modelling, (ii) includes packages designed for fitting, tuning, and validating various models, and (iii) allows easy integration of new algorithms and methods.

tidysdm allows easy, flexible and quick species distribution modelling by supporting standard algorithms, including additional SDM-oriented functions, and giving the opportunity of using any algorithm or procedure to fit, tune and validate a large number of different models. Additionally, it provides further functions to easily fit models based on paleo/time-scattered data.

The package includes two vignettes detailing standard procedures for present-day and time-scattered data. These vignettes also showcase the integration with pastclim (Leonardi et al. 2023) to allow easier access to palaeoclimatic data series, if needed, but users can bring in their own climatic data in standard formats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LINull models provide an invaluable baseline against which to test fundamental ecological hypotheses and highlight patterns in foraging choices that cannot be explained by neutral processes or sampling artefacts. In this way, null models can advance our understanding beyond simplistic dietary descriptions to identify drivers of interactions. This method, however, requires estimates of resource availability, which are generally imperfect representations of highly dynamic systems. Optimising method selection is crucial for study design, but the precise effects of different resource availability data on the efficacy of null models are poorly understood.
C_LIO_LIUsing spider-prey networks as a model, we used prey abundance (suction sample) and activity density (sticky trap) data, and combinations of the two, to simulate null networks. We compared null diet composition, network properties (e.g., connectance and nestedness) and deviations of simulations from metabarcoding-based spider dietary data (to ascertain how different prey availability data alter ecological interpretation.
C_LIO_LIDifferent sampling methods produced different null networks and inferred distinct prey selectivity. Null networks based on prey abundance and combined frequency-of-occurrence data more closely resembled the observed diet composition, and those based on prey abundance, activity density and proportionally combined data generated network properties most like dietary metabarcoding networks.
C_LIO_LIWe show that survey method choice impacts all aspects of null network analyses, the precise effects varying between methods but ultimately altering ecological interpretation by increasing disparity in network properties or trophic niches between null and directly constructed networks. Merging datasets can generate more complete prey availability data but is not a panacea because it introduces different biases. The choice of method should reflect the research hypotheses and study system being investigated. Ultimately, survey methods should emulate the foraging mode of the focal predator as closely as possible, informed by the known ecology, natural history and behaviour of the predator.

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOdor plumes in turbulent environments are intermittent and sparse, yet many animals effectively navigate to odor sources to find food [1]. Computational and lab-scaled experiments [2, 3, 4] have suggested that information about the source distance may be encoded in odor signal statistics, yet it is unclear whether useful and continuous distance estimates can be made under real-world flow conditions. Here we analyze odor signals from outdoor experiments with a sensor moving across large spatial scales in desert and forest environments to show that odor signal statistics can yield useful estimates of distance. The probability distribution of statistics from individual whiffs (contiguous odor sequences) are correlated with distance, but their correlation coefficient is poor. However, we show that a useful estimate of distance can be found by incorporating whiff statistics from time history of [~]10-seconds, resulting in a strong correlation of R2 [~]0.70. We identified whiff concentration and duration to be the most informative features. By combining distance estimates from a linear model with wind-relative motion dynamics, we were able to estimate source distance in a 60x60 m2 area with median errors of 3-8 meters, a distance at which point odor sources are within visual range for animals such as mosquitoes [5, 6]. Finally, we show that such estimates are only feasible if odor signal information is recorded at temporal resolutions of[&amp;ge;] 20 Hz. Together, our results provide a compelling case for how odor signal statistics could be used by animals, or man-made machines, to optimize plume tracking decisions at large spatial scales with natural wind.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental stochasticity is a key determinant of population viability. Decades of work exploring how environmental stochasticity influences population dynamics have highlighted the ability of some natural populations to limit the negative effects of environmental stochasticity, one of these strategies being demographic buffering. Whilst various methods exist to quantify demographic buffering, we still do not know which environment factors and demographic characteristics are most responsible for the demographic buffering observed in natural populations. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the relative effects of three key drivers of demographic buffering: environment components (e.g., temporal autocorrelation and variance), population structure, and demographic rates (e.g., progression and fertility). Using Integral Projection Models, we explore how these drivers impact the demographic buffering abilities of three plant species with different life histories and demonstrate how our approach successfully characterises a populations capacity to demographically buffer against environmental stochasticity in a changing world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Breeding birds in agricultural landscapes have declined considerably since the 1950s and the beginning of agricultural intensification in Europe. Given the increasing pressure on agricultural land, it is necessary to identify conservation measures that consume little productive land. We tested the compensation hypothesis which states that field margins may represent substitute habitats for bird species in agricultural wetlands. We monitored bird species in 86 crop fields in rice paddy landscapes of Camargue (southern France), a wetland of international importance for birds. We investigated whether the area of three types of field margins (reed strips, grass strips and hedgerows) within a 500 meter buffer around the centroid of each crop fields had an effect on the abundance of bird species from three groups defined based on their primary habitat (reedbeds, grasslands, and forest edge species). We controlled for the area of each type of semi-natural habitat (wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands), crop diversity (rice, wheat, alfalfa, rape, and market gardening) and mean crop field size. Results show partial support of the compensation hypothesis with species-dependent responses to primary and substitute habitat area. Some species within the reedbed and grassland bird guilds are favored by the area of their primary habitat as well as by the area of field margins, in line with the compensation hypothesis. Eurasian reed warbler is favored by the area of both wetlands and reed strips. Corn bunting is favored by grassland and grass strip areas. We could not confirm the compensation hypothesis for other species. However, this may be due to the fact that most of these species did not respond to their primary habitat. These results therefore suggest that field margins may represent substitute habitats for some species but further studies, in contexts where species are strongly associated with their primary habitat, would be needed to confirm the generality of this hypothesis. Our results also suggest that species response to increasing the area of a field margin type may vary among guilds and even within guilds. Therefore, it may be difficult to favor all species within a given landscape and management actions may need to be tailored to whichever species are locally associated with the highest conservation priority. To tackle this challenge, it may be necessary to design landscape management actions at different spatial scales.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the context of the soil food web, the transfer of plant-fixed energy and carbon to higher trophic levels has traditionally been attributed to two main energy channels: the fungal energy channel and the bacterial energy channel. Historically, protists were overlooked in the fungal energy channel, which was believed to be controlled by fungivorous microarthropods and nematodes. In this study, we investigated fungivorous protists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings revealed a notable abundance and diversity of protists that have developed specialized strategies to overcome the protective cell wall of fungi. Among the identified species were two Vampyrellida (Rhizaria) species, namely Theratromyxa weberi and Platyreta germanica, as well as one Arcellinida (Amoebozoa) species, called Cryptodifflugia oviformis. While T. weberi typically consumed entire fungal cells, the other two species perforated fungal cell walls and extracted the cellular contents. We elucidate the feeding strategies and dietary ranges of the amoebae, highlighting the non-uniform nature of fungivory in protists, as different taxa have evolved distinct approaches to access fungi as a food source. Moreover, we provide publicly available cultures of these protists to facilitate further experimental investigations within the research community.</p>

Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificacao Florestal e Agricola (IMAFLORA) near Sao Felix do Xingu, in Para, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called TerraBio. Our results suggest that, due to IMAFLORAs shaded cocoa projects, over 400 acres were restored in the intervention area and the community composition of arthropods in shaded cocoa is closer to second-growth forests than that of pastures. In reviewing the coupled approach, we found multiple aspects worked well, and we conclude by presenting multiple lessons learned.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbes adopt a variety of metabolic strategies to consume resources in fluctuating environments, but most work has focused on understanding these strategies in the context of isolated species, rather than diverse natural communities. We systematically measure the feasibility, dynamical and structural stability of multispecies microbial communities adopting different metabolic strategies. Our results reveal key distinctions between the ecological properties of different metabolic strategies, showing that communities containing sequential utilizers are more resilient to resource fluctuations, but are less feasible than co-utilizing communities.</p>
