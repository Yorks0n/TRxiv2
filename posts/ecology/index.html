E.; Brookes, V.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553798\nThe geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.\nSimulating animal space use from fitted integrated Step-Selection Functions (iSSF)\nAuthors: Signer, J.; Fieberg, J.; Reineking, B.; Schlaegel, U.; Smith, B. J.; Balkenhol, N.; Avgar, T.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552754\nO_LIA standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data. C_LIO_LIIntegrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths. C_LIO_LIHere, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package). C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity.

There is a need for targeted conservation initiatives such as the demarcation of landscape connections, defined as areas that encompass environmental variables that promote the natural movement of individuals between populations, which can facilitate gene flow. Landscape connections can mitigate genetic isolation, genetic drift, and inbreeding, which can occur in isolated populations in protected areas. Promoting gene flow can reduce the risk of extirpation often associated with isolated populations. Here we develop and test models for identifying landscape connections among African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations by combining habitat suitability modeling with gene flow estimates across a large region including seven countries. We find a pronounced non-linear response to unsuitable habitat, consistent with previous studies showing that non-transformed habitat models are poor predictors of gene flow. We generated a landscape connections map that considers both suitable habitats based on telemetry occurrence data and gene flow estimated as the inverse of individual genetic distance, delineating areas that are important for maintaining elephant population connectivity. Our approach represents a novel framework for developing spatially and genetically informed conservation strategies for elephants and many other taxa distributed across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes.\nFive years later, with double the demographic data, naked mole-rat mortality rates continue to defy Gompertzian laws by not increasing with age\nAuthors: Ruby, J. G.; Smith, M.; Buffenstein, R.\nScore: 30.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.27.534424\nThe naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a mouse-sized rodent species, notable for its eusociality and long lifespan. Previously, we reported that demographic aging, i.e., the exponential increase of mortality hazard that accompanies advancing age in mammals and other organisms, does not occur in naked mole-rats (Ruby et al, 2018). The demographic data supporting that conclusion had taken over three decades to accumulate, starting with the original rearing of H.glaber in captivity. In the five years following that study, we [~]doubled our quantity of demographic data. Here, we re-evaluated our prior conclusions in light of these new data and found them to be supported and indeed strengthened. We additionally provided insight into the social dynamics of captive H.glaber with data and analyses of body weight and colony size versus mortality. Finally, we provide a phylogenetically-proximal comparator in the form of lifespan data from our Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) colony and demographic meta-analysis of those data along with published data from Ansells mole-rat (Fukomys anselli). We found Fukomys mortality hazard to increase gradually with age, an observation with implications on the evolution of exceptional lifespan among mole-rats and the ecological factors that may have accompanied that evolution.\nEmerging Threat of Ranavirus: Prevalence, Genetic Diversity, and Climatic Drivers of Ranavirus (Family Iridoviridae) in ectothermic vertebrates of Asia\nAuthors: Herath, J.; Sun, D.; Ellepola, G.; Subramaniam, K.; Meegaskumbura, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553946\nRanavirus disease, caused by viruses within the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), is considered a globally emerging infectious disease linked to mass mortality events in both wild and cultured ectothermic vertebrates. Surveillance work is however limited in Asia hence prevalence and the dynamics of the disease remains poorly understood. To understand disease burden and the potential biotic and abiotic drivers in southern China region, we conducted a systematic surveillance of the ranavirus across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region (GAR). For this, we used a multifaceted approach involving screening of amphibians and other potential reservoirs, diagnostic tests, phylogenetic analyses, prevalence estimation, co-infection assessments, and climatic niche analyses. Over one thousand individuals were sampled across 25 sampling sites. We found ninety-two individuals from 18 species of ectothermic vertebrates to be infected with ranavirus. Two lineages were responsible - Rana nigromaculata ranavirus and Tiger frog virus were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) gene fragment. We also found evidence of a co-infection with ranavirus and Bd that can be highly detrimental to host populations; possibly the first such documentation in Asia. Our niche modelling analysis suggests that precipitation and seasonality play an important role in ranavirus prevalence in Guangxi region - southwestern, southeastern, central and northeastern regions of GAR can be considered to be optimum habitats for ranaviruses. Infection rates in wild frog species have reached 100% in some areas, even in nature reserves. Our research also indicates that culture facilities and pet farms are frequently infected, serving as likely vectors for the regional and global spread of ranaviruses. The knowledge generated suggests the need for systematic surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, and control of international animal trade to prevent further transmission and protection of biodiversity and aquaculture industries across Asia.\nInteractions between temperature and nutrients determine the population dynamics of primary producers\nAuthors: Bieg, C.; Vasseur, D.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554290\nGlobal change is rapidly and fundamentally altering many of the processes regulating the flux of energy throughout ecosystems and although researchers now understand the effect of temperature on key rates (such as aquatic primary productivity), the theoretical foundation needed to generate forecasts of biomass dynamics and extinction risk remains underdeveloped. We develop new theory that describes the interconnected effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton populations and show that the thermal response of equilibrium biomass (i.e., carrying capacity) always peaks at a lower temperature than for productivity (i.e., growth rate). This difference results from trade-offs between the thermal responses of growth, death, and per-capita impact on the nutrient pool, making this thermal mismatch highly general and applicable to widely used population models. We further show that non-equilibrium dynamics depend on the pace of environmental change relative to underlying vital rates, and that populations respond to variable environments differently at high vs. low temperatures due to thermal asymmetries.\nMonitoring Lake Okeechobee Harmful Algal Bloom populations and dynamics with a long-duration Autonomous Surface Vehicle\nAuthors: Ruiz-Xomchuk, V.; Duncan, S.; McFarland, M. N.; Beckler, J. S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554529\nThis article describes the main findings of a full year of continuous operation of a 2-meter Autonomous Sail and Solar Surface Drone, the Nav2 (Navocean Inc.), as part of a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) monitoring program in Lake Okeechobee. The Nav2 was equipped with a set of water quality and atmospheric sensors, that recorded high frequency measurements ({inverted exclamation} 1 min) and transmitted near real-time information to allow reporting through a web portal for assessment and operation responses. Major findings include detection of HABs early in the year through chlorophyll (chl-a) and phycocyanin (phyco) fluorometric measurements, as well as different spatial scales of variability in the algal patches. The 24/7 high resolution monitoring allowed detection of patch motion and discrimination between growth and motion along a transect. Furthermore, the platform can potentially fingerprint specific HAB species based on the relatively fine-scale spatial expression of the phyco to chl-a ratio, which essentially captures the bloom macrostructure (e.g. surface scums versus more uniform sub-surface waves over 0.1 - 1 km scale). Sensor outputs, when converted to concentrations based on calibrated with pure laboratory standards, did not accurately yield true chl-a or phyco values when compared to validation samples, likely due to the high turbidity of the lake. However, routine solid-state validations of fluorometric measurements proved useful for assessing consistency in optical sensors to check for sensor drift (e.g. to due biofouling), which was not significant. Overall this demonstration shows that the Nav2 can uniquely and reliably provide in situ HAB and environmental monitoring capabilities in a large, turbid, shallow lake. We envision that platform as an innovative technology for water resource managers by providing turn-key long-duration baseline environmental data (hands-off waypoint navigation), early warnings of HABs for protecting human health, and for HAB mitigation monitoring.\nTemperature and intraspecific variation affect host-parasite interactions\nAuthors: Ismail, S.; Farner, J.; Couper, L.; Mordecai, E. A.; Lyberger, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554680\nParasites play key roles in regulating aquatic ecosystems, yet the impact of climate warming on their ecology and disease transmission remains poorly understood. Isolating the effect of warming is challenging as transmission involves multiple interacting species and potential intraspecific variation in temperature responses of one or more of these species. Here, we leverage a wide-ranging mosquito species and its facultative parasite as a model system to investigate the impact of temperature on host-parasite interactions and disease transmission. We conducted a common garden experiment measuring parasite growth and infection rates at seven temperatures using 12 field-collected parasite populations and a single mosquito population. We find that both free-living growth rates and infection rates varied with temperature, which were highest at 18-24.5C and 13C, respectively. Further, we find intraspecific variation in peak performance temperature reflecting patterns of local thermal adaptation-parasite populations from warmer source environments typically had higher thermal optima for free-living growth rates. For infection rates, we found a significant interaction between parasite population and nonlinear effects of temperature. These findings underscore the need to consider both host and parasite thermal responses, as well as intraspecific variation in thermal responses, when predicting the impacts of climate change on disease in aquatic ecosystems.\nSpatial patterns in the diet of Gyps vultures in India and their implications for conservation\nAuthors: Ghosh-Harihar, M.; Yadav, N.; Gurung, N.; C.S., D.; B., S.; C.K., V.; Prakash, V.; Green, R. E.; Ramakrishnan, U.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554114\nDietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in \u003e95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.\nMeta-omic profiling reveals ubiquity of genes encoding for the high value nitrogen rich biopolymer cyanophycin in activated sludge microbiomes\nAuthors: Farmer, M.; Raj, R.; Tarpeh, W.; Tyo, K.; Wells, G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.553871\nRecovering nitrogen (N) from municipal wastewater is a promising approach to prevent nutrient pollution, reduce energy use, and transition towards a circular N bioeconomy, but remains a technologically challenging endeavor. Existing N recovery techniques are optimized for high-strength, low-volume wastewater. Therefore, developing methods to concentrate dilute N from mainstream wastewater will bridge the gap between existing technologies and practical implementation. The N-rich biopolymer cyanophycin is a promising candidate for N bioconcentration and recovery due to its solubility characteristics and potential for high levels of accumulation in a limited number of bacterial isolates. However, the cyanophycin synthesis pathway is poorly explored in natural and engineered microbiomes. In this study, we analyzed over 3700 publicly available metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and found that the cyanophycin synthesis gene cphA was ubiquitous across common activated sludge bacteria. Surprisingly, we found that cphA was present in all analyzed genomes of the common phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAO) Ca. Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera, suggesting potential for simultaneous N and P bioconcentration in the same organisms. Using metatranscriptomic data, we also confirmed the expression of cphA in lab-scale bioreactors enriched with PAO. Our findings suggest that cyanophycin synthesis is a ubiquitous metabolic pathway in activated sludge microbiomes and therefore may have potential for integration in existing biological nutrient removal and recovery processes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for future evaluations of combined N and P bioaccumulation, with the ultimate goal of advancing widespread adoption of nutrient recovery from municipal wastewater.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIA standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data.
C_LIO_LIIntegrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package).
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity.

        <p class="abstract">Across Africa, space for conservation is sometimes limited to formally protected areas that have become progressively more isolated. There is a need for targeted conservation initiatives such as the demarcation of landscape connections, defined as areas that encompass environmental variables that promote the natural movement of individuals between populations, which can facilitate gene flow. Landscape connections can mitigate genetic isolation, genetic drift, and inbreeding, which can occur in isolated populations in protected areas. Promoting gene flow can reduce the risk of extirpation often associated with isolated populations. Here we develop and test models for identifying landscape connections among African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations by combining habitat suitability modeling with gene flow estimates across a large region including seven countries. We find a pronounced non-linear response to unsuitable habitat, consistent with previous studies showing that non-transformed habitat models are poor predictors of gene flow. We generated a landscape connections map that considers both suitable habitats based on telemetry occurrence data and gene flow estimated as the inverse of individual genetic distance, delineating areas that are important for maintaining elephant population connectivity. Our approach represents a novel framework for developing spatially and genetically informed conservation strategies for elephants and many other taxa distributed across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a mouse-sized rodent species, notable for its eusociality and long lifespan. Previously, we reported that demographic aging, i.e., the exponential increase of mortality hazard that accompanies advancing age in mammals and other organisms, does not occur in naked mole-rats (Ruby et al, 2018). The demographic data supporting that conclusion had taken over three decades to accumulate, starting with the original rearing of H.glaber in captivity. In the five years following that study, we [~]doubled our quantity of demographic data. Here, we re-evaluated our prior conclusions in light of these new data and found them to be supported and indeed strengthened. We additionally provided insight into the social dynamics of captive H.glaber with data and analyses of body weight and colony size versus mortality. Finally, we provide a phylogenetically-proximal comparator in the form of lifespan data from our Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) colony and demographic meta-analysis of those data along with published data from Ansells mole-rat (Fukomys anselli). We found Fukomys mortality hazard to increase gradually with age, an observation with implications on the evolution of exceptional lifespan among mole-rats and the ecological factors that may have accompanied that evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ranavirus disease, caused by viruses within the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), is considered a globally emerging infectious disease linked to mass mortality events in both wild and cultured ectothermic vertebrates. Surveillance work is however limited in Asia hence prevalence and the dynamics of the disease remains poorly understood. To understand disease burden and the potential biotic and abiotic drivers in southern China region, we conducted a systematic surveillance of the ranavirus across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region (GAR). For this, we used a multifaceted approach involving screening of amphibians and other potential reservoirs, diagnostic tests, phylogenetic analyses, prevalence estimation, co-infection assessments, and climatic niche analyses. Over one thousand individuals were sampled across 25 sampling sites. We found ninety-two individuals from 18 species of ectothermic vertebrates to be infected with ranavirus. Two lineages were responsible - Rana nigromaculata ranavirus and Tiger frog virus were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) gene fragment. We also found evidence of a co-infection with ranavirus and Bd that can be highly detrimental to host populations; possibly the first such documentation in Asia. Our niche modelling analysis suggests that precipitation and seasonality play an important role in ranavirus prevalence in Guangxi region - southwestern, southeastern, central and northeastern regions of GAR can be considered to be optimum habitats for ranaviruses. Infection rates in wild frog species have reached 100% in some areas, even in nature reserves. Our research also indicates that culture facilities and pet farms are frequently infected, serving as likely vectors for the regional and global spread of ranaviruses. The knowledge generated suggests the need for systematic surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, and control of international animal trade to prevent further transmission and protection of biodiversity and aquaculture industries across Asia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global change is rapidly and fundamentally altering many of the processes regulating the flux of energy throughout ecosystems and although researchers now understand the effect of temperature on key rates (such as aquatic primary productivity), the theoretical foundation needed to generate forecasts of biomass dynamics and extinction risk remains underdeveloped. We develop new theory that describes the interconnected effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton populations and show that the thermal response of equilibrium biomass (i.e., carrying capacity) always peaks at a lower temperature than for productivity (i.e., growth rate). This difference results from trade-offs between the thermal responses of growth, death, and per-capita impact on the nutrient pool, making this thermal mismatch highly general and applicable to widely used population models. We further show that non-equilibrium dynamics depend on the pace of environmental change relative to underlying vital rates, and that populations respond to variable environments differently at high vs. low temperatures due to thermal asymmetries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This article describes the main findings of a full year of continuous operation of a 2-meter Autonomous Sail and Solar Surface Drone, the Nav2 (Navocean Inc.), as part of a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) monitoring program in Lake Okeechobee. The Nav2 was equipped with a set of water quality and atmospheric sensors, that recorded high frequency measurements ({inverted exclamation} 1 min) and transmitted near real-time information to allow reporting through a web portal for assessment and operation responses. Major findings include detection of HABs early in the year through chlorophyll (chl-a) and phycocyanin (phyco) fluorometric measurements, as well as different spatial scales of variability in the algal patches. The 24/7 high resolution monitoring allowed detection of patch motion and discrimination between growth and motion along a transect. Furthermore, the platform can potentially fingerprint specific HAB species based on the relatively fine-scale spatial expression of the phyco to chl-a ratio, which essentially captures the bloom macrostructure (e.g. surface scums versus more uniform sub-surface waves over 0.1 - 1 km scale). Sensor outputs, when converted to concentrations based on calibrated with pure laboratory standards, did not accurately yield true chl-a or phyco values when compared to validation samples, likely due to the high turbidity of the lake. However, routine solid-state validations of fluorometric measurements proved useful for assessing consistency in optical sensors to check for sensor drift (e.g. to due biofouling), which was not significant. Overall this demonstration shows that the Nav2 can uniquely and reliably provide in situ HAB and environmental monitoring capabilities in a large, turbid, shallow lake. We envision that platform as an innovative technology for water resource managers by providing turn-key long-duration baseline environmental data (hands-off waypoint navigation), early warnings of HABs for protecting human health, and for HAB mitigation monitoring.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parasites play key roles in regulating aquatic ecosystems, yet the impact of climate warming on their ecology and disease transmission remains poorly understood. Isolating the effect of warming is challenging as transmission involves multiple interacting species and potential intraspecific variation in temperature responses of one or more of these species. Here, we leverage a wide-ranging mosquito species and its facultative parasite as a model system to investigate the impact of temperature on host-parasite interactions and disease transmission. We conducted a common garden experiment measuring parasite growth and infection rates at seven temperatures using 12 field-collected parasite populations and a single mosquito population. We find that both free-living growth rates and infection rates varied with temperature, which were highest at 18-24.5C and 13C, respectively. Further, we find intraspecific variation in peak performance temperature reflecting patterns of local thermal adaptation-parasite populations from warmer source environments typically had higher thermal optima for free-living growth rates. For infection rates, we found a significant interaction between parasite population and nonlinear effects of temperature. These findings underscore the need to consider both host and parasite thermal responses, as well as intraspecific variation in thermal responses, when predicting the impacts of climate change on disease in aquatic ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary analyses are particularly useful for developing conservation programmes for species threatened by resource depletion, poisoning and environmental pollution. Gyps vultures in South Asia represent one such case, having undergone a population collapse caused by feeding on carcasses of cattle treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. Following a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, populations of vultures remain low and mostly concentrated near protected areas. Understanding the role of protected areas in the recovery of these critically endangered species requires analyses of spatial variation in their diet. We used faecal metabarcoding to investigate the spatial variation in the diet of Gyps vultures across four landscapes from sites located inside and outside protected areas. We collected faecal 642 samples, of which 419 yielded adequate molecular data to identify the vulture species and 30 molecular operational taxonomic units corresponding to at least 28 diet species. The diet was dominated by large ungulates and varied across landscapes, protection status and vulture species, with the observed variation largely explained by differential intake of wild and domestic species. Domestic livestock was present in &gt;95% of the samples from central, west and north India, but 77% of the samples had only wild species in south India. This variation was explained by livestock density within 100 km radius of the sampling site. Our results imply that protected areas may not offer a respite from possibility of diclofenac-poisoning across most parts of the country and efforts should continue unabated to remove nephrotoxic drugs from veterinary use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recovering nitrogen (N) from municipal wastewater is a promising approach to prevent nutrient pollution, reduce energy use, and transition towards a circular N bioeconomy, but remains a technologically challenging endeavor. Existing N recovery techniques are optimized for high-strength, low-volume wastewater. Therefore, developing methods to concentrate dilute N from mainstream wastewater will bridge the gap between existing technologies and practical implementation. The N-rich biopolymer cyanophycin is a promising candidate for N bioconcentration and recovery due to its solubility characteristics and potential for high levels of accumulation in a limited number of bacterial isolates. However, the cyanophycin synthesis pathway is poorly explored in natural and engineered microbiomes. In this study, we analyzed over 3700 publicly available metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and found that the cyanophycin synthesis gene cphA was ubiquitous across common activated sludge bacteria. Surprisingly, we found that cphA was present in all analyzed genomes of the common phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAO) Ca.  Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera, suggesting potential for simultaneous N and P bioconcentration in the same organisms. Using metatranscriptomic data, we also confirmed the expression of cphA in lab-scale bioreactors enriched with PAO. Our findings suggest that cyanophycin synthesis is a ubiquitous metabolic pathway in activated sludge microbiomes and therefore may have potential for integration in existing biological nutrient removal and recovery processes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for future evaluations of combined N and P bioaccumulation, with the ultimate goal of advancing widespread adoption of nutrient recovery from municipal wastewater.</p>
