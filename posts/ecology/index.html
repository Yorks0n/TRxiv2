E.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566377\nEarth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston \u0026 Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.\nEvaluating diversionary feeding as a method to resolve conservation conflicts in a recovering ecosystem\nAuthors: Bamber, J.; Kortland, K.; Sutherland, C.; Payo-Payo, A.; Lambin, X.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566200\nO_LIThe recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery. C_LIO_LIWe evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped. C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year. C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.

M.\nScore: 128.4, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.560707\nHuman decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

E.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567078\nMicrobiomes often benefit plants, conferring resistance to pathogens, improving stress tolerance, or promoting plant growth. As potential plant mutualists, however, microbiomes are not a single organism but a community of species with complex interactions among microbial taxa and between microbes and their shared host. The nature of ecological interactions among microbes in the microbiome can have important consequences for the net effects of microbiomes on hosts. Here, we compared the effects of individual microbial strains and 10-strain synthetic communities on microbial productivity and host growth using the common duckweed Lemna minor and a synthetic, simplified version of its native microbiome. Except for Pseudomonas protegens, which was a mutualist when tested alone, all of the single strains we tested were commensals on hosts, benefiting from plant presence but not increasing host growth relative to uninoculated controls. However, 10-strain synthetic microbial communities increased both microbial productivity and duckweed growth more than the average single-strain inoculation and uninoculated controls, meaning that host-microbiome mutualisms can emerge from community interactions among microbes on hosts. The effects of community inoculation were sub-additive, suggesting at least some competition among microbes in the duckweed microbiome. We also investigated the relationship between L. minor fitness and that of its microbes, providing some of the first empirical estimates of broad fitness alignment between plants and members of their microbiomes; hosts grew faster with more productive microbes or microbiomes.\nSmall dams drive Anopheles abundance during the dry season in a high malaria burden area of Malawi\nAuthors: Zembere, K.; Jones, C. M.; Mthawanji, R.; Nkolokosa, C.; Kamwezi, R.; Kalonde, P. K.; Stanton, M. C.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567025\nThis study explores the influence of small dams on the exposure to malaria vectors during the dry season in Kasungu district, Malawi, an area recently identified as high priority for malaria interventions by the National Malaria Control Programme. Small dam impoundments provide communities with a continuous supply of water for domestic and agricultural activities across sub-Saharan Africa and are considered vital to food security and climate change resilience. However, these permanent water bodies also create ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes in typically arid landscapes. The study focuses on a specific dam impoundment and its vicinity, aiming to assess its spatial and temporal influence on indoor vector densities. Throughout May to August 2021, CDC light traps were used to measure indoor mosquito densities for two consecutive nights per month in three communities located at increasing distances from the dam (0km, ~1km, ~2km). Simultaneously, drone imagery was captured for each community, enabling the identification of additional standing water within approximately 400 meters of selected households. Larval sampling was carried out within the impoundment periphery and in additional water bodies identified in the drone imagery. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were employed to analyse the indoor Anopheles abundance data, estimating the effects of household structure (open/closed eaves), month, temperature, and water proximity on malaria vector exposure. Throughout 685 trapping nights, a total of 1,256 mosquitoes were captured, with 33% (412) being female Anopheles. Among these, 91% were morphologically identified as An. funestus s.l., and 5% as An. gambiae s.l. Catches progressively declines in each consecutive trapping month as the environment became drier. This decline was much slower in Malangano, the community next to the dam, with abundance being notably higher in June and July. Further, the majority of An. gambiae s.l. were caught in May, with none identified in July and August. Anopheles larvae were found both in the impoundment and other smaller water bodies such as irrigation wells in each survey month, however the presence of these smaller water bodies did not have a significant impact on adult female mosquito catches in the GLMM. The study concludes that proximity to the dam impoundment was the primary driver of differences between survey communities with the abundance in Chikhombwe (~1km away) and Chiponde (~2km away) being 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) lower than Malangano respectively after adjusting for other factors. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions, such as larval source management or housing improvements, near small dams to mitigate malaria transmission risks during the dry season. Further research is needed to develop cost-effective strategies for vector control within and around these impoundments.\nCovert RNA viruses in medflies differ in their mode of transmission and tissue tropism\nAuthors: Hernandez-Pelegrin, L.; Huditz, H. I.; Castillo, P. G.; de Ruijter, N. C. A.; van Oers, M. M.; Herrero, S.; Ros, V. I. D.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566245\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the presence of covert viral infections in insects. These infections can be transmitted in insect populations via two main routes: vertical from parents to offspring, or horizontal between nonrelated individuals. Thirteen covert RNA viruses have been described in the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). Some of these viruses are established in different laboratory-reared and wild medfly populations, although variations in the viral repertoire and viral levels have been observed at different time points. To better understand these viral dynamics, we characterized the prevalence and levels of covert RNA viruses in two medfly strains, assessed the route of transmission of these viruses, and explored their distribution in medfly adult tissues. Altogether, our results indicated that the different RNA viruses found in medflies vary in their preferred route of transmission. Two iflaviruses and a narnavirus are predominantly transmitted through vertical transmission via the female, while a nodavirus and a nora virus exhibited a preference for horizontal transmission. Overall, our results give valuable insights into the viral tropism and transmission of RNA viruses in the medfly, contributing to the understanding of viral dynamics in insect populations.\nIndividual tree crown maps for the National Ecological Observatory Network\nAuthors: Weinstein, B.; Marconi, S.; Zare, A.; Bohlman, S.; Singh, A.; Graves, S.

P.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563626\nThe ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales allows an unprecedented view of forest ecosystems, forest restoration and responses to disturbance. To create detailed maps of tree species, airborne remote sensing can cover areas containing millions of trees at high spatial resolution. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual tree species using ground truthed data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees for 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network. Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1km^2 shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of six species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species. All predictions were uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. These data can be used to study forest macro-ecology, functional ecology, and responses to anthropogenic change.\nPhotosymbiosis reduces the environmental stress response under a heat challenge in a facultatively symbiotic coral\nAuthors: Wuitchik, D. M.; Aichelman, H. E.; Atherton, K. F.; Brown, C. M.; Chen, X.; DiRoberts, L.; Pelose, G. E.; Tramonte, C. A.; Davies, S. W.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566890\nThe symbiosis between corals of the order Scleractinia and dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is sensitive to environmental stress. The oxidative bleaching hypothesis posits that extreme temperatures lead to accumulation of photobiont-derived reactive oxygen species ROS, which exacerbates the coral environmental stress response (ESR). To understand how photosymbiosis modulates coral ESRs, these responses must be explored in hosts in and out of symbiosis. We leveraged the facultatively symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata, which offers an opportunity to uncouple the ESR across its two symbiotic states (symbiotic, aposymbiotic). Colonies of both symbiotic states were exposed to three temperature treatments for 15 days: i) control (static 18{degrees}C), ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 32{degrees}C), and iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 6{degrees}C) after which host gene expression was profiled. Cold challenged corals elicited widespread differential expression, however, there were no differences between symbiotic states. In contrast, symbiotic colonies exhibited greater gene expression plasticity under heat challenge, including enrichment of cell cycle pathways involved in controlling photobiont growth. Counter to the oxidative bleaching hypothesis, this plasticity did not include signatures of stress, and rather a dampened ESR under heat challenge was observed, suggesting that photobionts reduce the hosts ESR under elevated temperatures in A. poculata.\nQuantifying potential abiotic drivers of the nurse-plant effect in two dominant shrub species of the northern Chihuahuan Desert\nAuthors: Ferrenberg, S.; Faist, A.; Osborne, B.; Lee, S.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567462\nAggregations of plants surrounded by areas without vegetation cover in dryland ecosystems are thought to arise when larger plants facilitate the recruitment and/or performance of smaller protege plants--a phenomenon referred to as the nurse-plant effect. While numerous drivers can generate a nurse-plant effect, efforts to quantify multiple drivers simultaneously are rare. After verifying a higher density of proteges beneath the foundational shrubs Larrea tridentata and Prosopis glandulosa, multiple potential mechanisms underlying the nurse-plant effect were quantified in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico. Comparisons of properties under shrub canopies relative to unvegetated interspaces revealed significantly greater concentrations of soil nutrients and lower photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperatures beneath shrubs but consistently higher soil moisture in interspaces despite a greater water holding capacity in soils beneath shrubs. Nutrient concentrations were greater, on average, in soils beneath P. glandulosa than L. tridentata but protege plant numbers did not significantly differ among the species. Further, in L. tridentata and P. glandulosa, canopy size was positively related to levels of understory shading, and canopy size of P. glandulosa was also positively related to soil nitrogen and microbial biomass. Results of this study suggest that a majority of the variance in the abiotic nurse-plant effect of this low-latitude system is explained by radiation interception and the concomitant reduction in temperatures experienced by protege plants as opposed to direct effects of shrubs on soil water availability. As global change pressures intensify in drylands, a loss of perennial plant cover through mortality or dieback in canopies could have substantial, negative effects on soil biogeochemical pools and plant diversity. Additional quantification of the spatial and temporal variance in different mechanisms driving the nurse-plant effect across environmental and climatic gradients is needed to improve our understanding of plant community dynamics in dryland ecosystems.\nThe majority of Germany's small agricultural streams are in poor ecological status\nAuthors: von Goenner, J.; Groening, J.; Grescho, V.; Neuer, L.; Haensch, V. G.; Laue, B.; Molsberger-Lange, E.; Wilharm, E.; Liess, M.; Bonn, A.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564349\nAgricultural pesticides, nutrients, and habitat degradation are major causes of insect declines in lowland streams. To effectively conserve and restore stream habitats, standardized stream monitoring data and societal support for freshwater protection are needed. Here, we sampled 137 small stream sites across Germany, 83% of which were located in agricultural catchments, with more than 900 citizen scientists in 96 monitoring groups. Sampling was carried out according to Water Framework Directive standards as part of the citizen science freshwater monitoring program FLOW in spring and summer 2021, 2022 and 2023. The biological indicator SPEARpesticides was used to assess pesticide exposure and effects based on benthic invertebrate community composition. Overall, 58% of the monitored agricultural stream sites did not achieve a good ecological status in terms of macroinvertebrate community composition and indicated high pesticide exposure (SPEARpesticides status class: 29% moderate, 19% poor, 11% bad). The indicated pesticide pressure in streams was related to the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment area (R2=0.23, p\u003c0.001). With regards to hydromorphology, monitoring results revealed that 65% of the agricultural stream sites failed to reach a good status. The data base produced by citizen science groups was characterized by a high degree of accuracy. This was quantified by a comparative survey of SPEARpesticides index (R2=0.79, p\u003c0.001) and hydromorphology index values (R2=0.72, p\u003c0.001) by citizen scientists and professionals. Such citizen-driven monitoring of the status of watercourses could play a crucial role in monitoring and implementing the objective of the European Water Framework Directive, thus contributing to restoring and protecting freshwater ecosystems.

        <p class="abstract">Earth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston &amp; Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIThe recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.
C_LIO_LIWe evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped.
C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.
C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.

        <p class="abstract">Human decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have-nots&#34;, with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

        <p class="abstract">Microbiomes often benefit plants, conferring resistance to pathogens, improving stress tolerance, or promoting plant growth. As potential plant mutualists, however, microbiomes are not a single organism but a community of species with complex interactions among microbial taxa and between microbes and their shared host. The nature of ecological interactions among microbes in the microbiome can have important consequences for the net effects of microbiomes on hosts. Here, we compared the effects of individual microbial strains and 10-strain synthetic communities on microbial productivity and host growth using the common duckweed Lemna minor and a synthetic, simplified version of its native microbiome. Except for Pseudomonas protegens, which was a mutualist when tested alone, all of the single strains we tested were commensals on hosts, benefiting from plant presence but not increasing host growth relative to uninoculated controls. However, 10-strain synthetic microbial communities increased both microbial productivity and duckweed growth more than the average single-strain inoculation and uninoculated controls, meaning that host-microbiome mutualisms can emerge from community interactions among microbes on hosts. The effects of community inoculation were sub-additive, suggesting at least some competition among microbes in the duckweed microbiome. We also investigated the relationship between L. minor fitness and that of its microbes, providing some of the first empirical estimates of broad fitness alignment between plants and members of their microbiomes; hosts grew faster with more productive microbes or microbiomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study explores the influence of small dams on the exposure to malaria vectors during the dry season in Kasungu district, Malawi, an area recently identified as high priority for malaria interventions by the National Malaria Control Programme. Small dam impoundments provide communities with a continuous supply of water for domestic and agricultural activities across sub-Saharan Africa and are considered vital to food security and climate change resilience. However, these permanent water bodies also create ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes in typically arid landscapes. The study focuses on a specific dam impoundment and its vicinity, aiming to assess its spatial and temporal influence on indoor vector densities. Throughout May to August 2021, CDC light traps were used to measure indoor mosquito densities for two consecutive nights per month in three communities located at increasing distances from the dam (0km, ~1km, ~2km). Simultaneously, drone imagery was captured for each community, enabling the identification of additional standing water within approximately 400 meters of selected households. Larval sampling was carried out within the impoundment periphery and in additional water bodies identified in the drone imagery. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were employed to analyse the indoor Anopheles abundance data, estimating the effects of household structure (open/closed eaves), month, temperature, and water proximity on malaria vector exposure. Throughout 685 trapping nights, a total of 1,256 mosquitoes were captured, with 33% (412) being female Anopheles. Among these, 91% were morphologically identified as An. funestus s.l., and 5% as An. gambiae s.l. Catches progressively declines in each consecutive trapping month as the environment became drier. This decline was much slower in Malangano, the community next to the dam, with abundance being notably higher in June and July. Further, the majority of An. gambiae s.l. were caught in May, with none identified in July and August. Anopheles larvae were found both in the impoundment and other smaller water bodies such as irrigation wells in each survey month, however the presence of these smaller water bodies did not have a significant impact on adult female mosquito catches in the GLMM. The study concludes that proximity to the dam impoundment was the primary driver of differences between survey communities with the abundance in Chikhombwe (~1km away) and Chiponde (~2km away) being 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) lower than Malangano respectively after adjusting for other factors. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions, such as larval source management or housing improvements, near small dams to mitigate malaria transmission risks during the dry season. Further research is needed to develop cost-effective strategies for vector control within and around these impoundments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of covert viral infections in insects. These infections can be transmitted in insect populations via two main routes: vertical from parents to offspring, or horizontal between nonrelated individuals. Thirteen covert RNA viruses have been described in the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). Some of these viruses are established in different laboratory-reared and wild medfly populations, although variations in the viral repertoire and viral levels have been observed at different time points. To better understand these viral dynamics, we characterized the prevalence and levels of covert RNA viruses in two medfly strains, assessed the route of transmission of these viruses, and explored their distribution in medfly adult tissues. Altogether, our results indicated that the different RNA viruses found in medflies vary in their preferred route of transmission. Two iflaviruses and a narnavirus are predominantly transmitted through vertical transmission via the female, while a nodavirus and a nora virus exhibited a preference for horizontal transmission. Overall, our results give valuable insights into the viral tropism and transmission of RNA viruses in the medfly, contributing to the understanding of viral dynamics in insect populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales allows an unprecedented view of forest ecosystems, forest restoration and responses to disturbance. To create detailed maps of tree species, airborne remote sensing can cover areas containing millions of trees at high spatial resolution. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual tree species using ground truthed data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees for 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network. Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1km^2 shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of six species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species. All predictions were uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. These data can be used to study forest macro-ecology, functional ecology, and responses to anthropogenic change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The symbiosis between corals of the order Scleractinia and dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is sensitive to environmental stress. The oxidative bleaching hypothesis posits that extreme temperatures lead to accumulation of photobiont-derived reactive oxygen species ROS, which exacerbates the coral environmental stress response (ESR). To understand how photosymbiosis modulates coral ESRs, these responses must be explored in hosts in and out of symbiosis. We leveraged the facultatively symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata, which offers an opportunity to uncouple the ESR across its two symbiotic states (symbiotic, aposymbiotic). Colonies of both symbiotic states were exposed to three temperature treatments for 15 days: i) control (static 18{degrees}C), ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 32{degrees}C), and iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 6{degrees}C) after which host gene expression was profiled. Cold challenged corals elicited widespread differential expression, however, there were no differences between symbiotic states. In contrast, symbiotic colonies exhibited greater gene expression plasticity under heat challenge, including enrichment of cell cycle pathways involved in controlling photobiont growth. Counter to the oxidative bleaching hypothesis, this plasticity did not include signatures of stress, and rather a dampened ESR under heat challenge was observed, suggesting that photobionts reduce the hosts ESR under elevated temperatures in A. poculata.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aggregations of plants surrounded by areas without vegetation cover in dryland ecosystems are thought to arise when larger plants facilitate the recruitment and/or performance of smaller protege plants--a phenomenon referred to as the nurse-plant effect. While numerous drivers can generate a nurse-plant effect, efforts to quantify multiple drivers simultaneously are rare. After verifying a higher density of proteges beneath the foundational shrubs Larrea tridentata and Prosopis glandulosa, multiple potential mechanisms underlying the nurse-plant effect were quantified in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico. Comparisons of properties under shrub canopies relative to unvegetated interspaces revealed significantly greater concentrations of soil nutrients and lower photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperatures beneath shrubs but consistently higher soil moisture in interspaces despite a greater water holding capacity in soils beneath shrubs. Nutrient concentrations were greater, on average, in soils beneath P. glandulosa than L. tridentata but protege plant numbers did not significantly differ among the species. Further, in L. tridentata and P. glandulosa, canopy size was positively related to levels of understory shading, and canopy size of P. glandulosa was also positively related to soil nitrogen and microbial biomass. Results of this study suggest that a majority of the variance in the abiotic nurse-plant effect of this low-latitude system is explained by radiation interception and the concomitant reduction in temperatures experienced by protege plants as opposed to direct effects of shrubs on soil water availability. As global change pressures intensify in drylands, a loss of perennial plant cover through mortality or dieback in canopies could have substantial, negative effects on soil biogeochemical pools and plant diversity. Additional quantification of the spatial and temporal variance in different mechanisms driving the nurse-plant effect across environmental and climatic gradients is needed to improve our understanding of plant community dynamics in dryland ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Agricultural pesticides, nutrients, and habitat degradation are major causes of insect declines in lowland streams. To effectively conserve and restore stream habitats, standardized stream monitoring data and societal support for freshwater protection are needed. Here, we sampled 137 small stream sites across Germany, 83% of which were located in agricultural catchments, with more than 900 citizen scientists in 96 monitoring groups. Sampling was carried out according to Water Framework Directive standards as part of the citizen science freshwater monitoring program FLOW in spring and summer 2021, 2022 and 2023. The biological indicator SPEARpesticides was used to assess pesticide exposure and effects based on benthic invertebrate community composition. Overall, 58% of the monitored agricultural stream sites did not achieve a good ecological status in terms of macroinvertebrate community composition and indicated high pesticide exposure (SPEARpesticides status class: 29%  moderate, 19%  poor, 11%  bad). The indicated pesticide pressure in streams was related to the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment area (R2=0.23, p&lt;0.001). With regards to hydromorphology, monitoring results revealed that 65% of the agricultural stream sites failed to reach a good status. The data base produced by citizen science groups was characterized by a high degree of accuracy. This was quantified by a comparative survey of SPEARpesticides index (R2=0.79, p&lt;0.001) and hydromorphology index values (R2=0.72, p&lt;0.001) by citizen scientists and professionals. Such citizen-driven monitoring of the status of watercourses could play a crucial role in monitoring and implementing the objective of the European Water Framework Directive, thus contributing to restoring and protecting freshwater ecosystems.
