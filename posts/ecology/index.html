Location: Europe. Time period: Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 127,000 years ago) to present. Major taxa studied: wild, large ([\u0026ge;]10 kg) terrestrial mammals. Methods: we assessed the distribution of 48 European megafauna species during the LIG using hindcasting modelling and fossil records. Then, we estimated the decline in megafauna community diversity and potential trait-based functional effects from the LIG to the present, accounting for climate differences between the two periods. Results: from the LIG to the present, species richness and community biomass across Europe dropped by 74.3% ({+/-} 9.9% SD) and 96.7% ({+/-} 4.1% SD), respectively. Functional diversity dropped by 59.1% ({+/-} 11.8% SD) for herbivores and by 48.2% ({+/-} 25.0% SD) for carnivores, while trait-informed potential vegetation and meat consumptions dropped by 91.1% ({+/-} 7.4% SD) and 61.2% ({+/-} 17.2% SD), respectively. The loss in megafauna diversity and associated ecological processes were high everywhere, but particularly in western Europe for carnivores and in the East European Plain for herbivores. We found that potential megafauna richness and functional patterns in the two periods were near identical if only climate-driven differences were considered. Main conclusions: severe, size-biased defaunation has degraded megafauna assemblages and megafauna-mediated ecological processes across Europe from the LIG to the present. These patterns cannot be explained by climate differences between the two periods, thus were likely driven by the impact of prehistoric Homo sapiens. The results suggest that the structure of wild ecosystems of the present strongly deviates from the evolutionary norm, notably with decreased functional heterogeneity and decreased fluxes of biogeochemical compounds across the trophic networks, highlighting the importance of ambitious policies of megafauna community restoration to support ecosystems functioning.\nDiversity loss in microbial ecosystems undergoing gradual environmental changes\nAuthors: Berger, A.; Gatt Harari, M.; Gross, A.; Erez, A.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548183\nMicrobial ecosystems in soils, oceans, and other environments are essential for global ecological stability. Environmental shifts are anticipated to trigger destabilizing events across the planet. In this study, we model how gradual environmental changes impact ecosystems, specifically when leading to a loss of diversity. We investigate how an ecosystem, within a serial-dilution setup, relaxes to a stable steady state. Our results reveal that as an ecosystem approaches its loss of diversity transition, its dynamics slow down. Consequently, diverse ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest soils, gradually driven past their transition point may exhibit a significant response lag. This suggests that some ecosystems may be closer to a collapse in diversity than current observations indicate. Although our model does not capture the full complexity of real-world ecosystems, it highlights critical aspects underlying the loss of biodiversity in changing environments. This has potential implications for empirical studies and when planning interventions.\nTreated eave screens in combination with screened doors and windows, are more effective than untreated eave screens in a similar combination in reducing indoor and outdoor Anopheles populations under semi-filed conditions in western Kenya\nAuthors: Abong'o, B.; Agumba, S.; Moshi, V.; Simwero, J.; Otima, J.; Ochomo, E.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547882\nIntroductionHuman habitats remain the main point of human-vector interaction leading to malaria transmission despite sustained use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Simple structural modifications involving screening of doors, windows and eaves have great potential for reducing indoor entry of mosquitoes and hence malaria transmission. MethodsFour huts, each constructed inside a semi-field structure, allowing the experimental release of mosquitoes at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kisumu research station were used in the study. Two huts had untreated eave and door screens and screened air cavities in place of windows in experiment 1 with the eave screen treated using Actellic(R) insecticide in experiment 2. The other two huts remained unscreened throughout the study. First filial (F1) generation of Anopheles funestus from Siaya, F0 reared from An. arabiensis larvae collected from Ahero and An. arabiensis Dongola strain from the insectary were raised to 3-day old adults and used in experiments. Two hundred, 3-day old adults of each species were released in each semi-field structure at dusk and recaptured the following day at 0700hrs and at 0900 hours. A single volunteer slept in each hut under untreated bed net each night of the study. Recaptured mosquitoes were counted and recorded by collection location, either indoor or outdoor of each hut in the different semi-field structures. ResultsSignificantly fewer An. arabiensis from Ahero [RR=0.10; (95%CI: 0.02-0.63); P\u003c0.0145], An. arabiensis Dongola strain [RR=0.11; (95%CI: 0.04 - 0.19); P\u003c0.0001 and An. funestus from Siaya [RR=0.10; (95%CI: 0.06-0.17); P\u003c0.0001] were observed inside modified huts compared to unmodified ones. Treating of eave screen material with Actellic(R) 300CS significantly reduced the numbers An. arabiensis from Ahero [RR=0.003; (95%CI: 0.00-0.03); P\u003c0.0001] and An. arabiensis Dongola strain [RR=0.03; (95%CI: 0.02-0.05); P\u003c0.0001] indoors of huts with treated eave screen compared to huts with untreated eave screens, while totally preventing entry of An. funestus indoors. These modifications cost \u003c250usd/structure. Discussion and ConclusionThis article describes affordable and effective ways of reducing mosquito entry into the house by modifying the eaves, doors and windows. These modifications were highly effective in reducing indoor entry of mosquitoes. Additionally, treatment of eave screen material with an effective insecticide further reduces the Anopheles population in and around the screened huts under semi-field conditions and could greatly complement existing vector control efforts.\nStatistical prediction of microbial metabolic traits from genomes\nAuthors: Li, Z.; Selim, A.; Kuehn, S.\nScore: 32.8, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547261\nThe metabolic activity of microbial communities is central to their role in biogeochemical cycles, human health, and biotechnology. Despite the abundance of sequencing data characterizing these consortia, it remains a serious challenge to predict microbial metabolic traits from sequencing data alone. Here we culture 96 bacterial isolates individually and assay their ability to grow on 10 distinct compounds as a sole carbon source. Using these data as well as two existing datasets, we show that statistical approaches can accurately predict bacterial carbon utilization traits from genomes. First, we show that classifiers trained on gene content can accurately predict bacterial carbon utilization phenotypes by encoding phylogenetic information. These models substantially outperform predictions made by constraint-based metabolic models automatically constructed from genomes. However, phylogeny-based predictions fail to predict traits for taxa that are phyloge-netically distant from any strains in the training set. To overcome this we train improved models on gene presence/absence to predict carbon utilization traits from gene content. We show that models that predict carbon utilization traits from gene presence/absence can generalize to taxa that are phylogenetically distant from the training set either by exploiting biochemical information for feature selection or by having sufficiently large datasets. In the latter case, we provide evidence that a statistical approach can identify putatively mechanistic genes involved in metabolic traits. Our study demonstrates the potential power for predicting microbial phenotypes from genotypes using statistical approaches.\nNew record of Dendronephthya hemprichi (Family: Nephtheidae) fromMediterranean, Israel- an evidence for tropicalization?\nAuthors: Nativ, H.; Galili, O.; Almuly, R.; Einbinder, S.; Tchernov, D.; Mass, T.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547739\nBioinvasions have the potential to provoke cascade effects that can disrupt natural ecosystems, and cause ecological regime shifts. The Mediterranean Sea is particularly prone to bioinvasions as the changing water conditions, evoked by climate change, are creating advantageous conditions for Lessepsian migrants from the Red Sea. Recently, in May 2023, a new alien species was documented in the Mediterranean Sea - a soft coral of the genus Dendronephthya. This discovery was made by divers conducting Long Term Ecological Research surveys, along the coast of Israel, at a depth of 42 m. Genetic and morphological testing were utilized to confirm the species identity as Dendronepthya hemprichi, an Indo-Pacific coral, common in the Red Sea. According to life history traits of this species such as accelerated attachment to available surfaces and fast growth, we expect it to rapidly expand its distribution and abundance across the Mediterranean.

M. R.; Hoye, T. T.; Dyrmann, M.; Karstoft, H.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.546989\nCameras and computer vision are revolutionising the study of insects, creating new research opportunities within agriculture, epidemiology, evolution, ecology and monitoring of biodiversity. However, a major challenge is the diversity of insects and close resemblances of many species combined with computer vision are often not sufficient to classify large numbers of insect species, which sometimes cannot be identified at the species level. Here, we present an algorithm to hierarchically classify insects from images, leveraging a simple taxonomy to (1) classify specimens across multiple taxonomic ranks simultaneously, and (2) highlight the lowest rank at which a reliable classification can be reached. Specifically, we propose multitask learning, a loss function incorporating class dependency at each taxonomic rank, and anomaly detection based on outlier analysis for quantification of uncertainty. First, we compile a dataset of 41,731 images of insects, combining images from time-lapse monitoring of floral scenes with images from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Second, we adapt state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, ResNet and EfficientNet, for the hierarchical classification of insects belonging to three orders, five families and nine species. Third, we assess model generalization for 11 species unseen by the trained models. Here, anomaly detection is used to predict the higher rank of the species not present in the training set. We found that incorporating a simple taxonomy into our model increased accuracy at higher taxonomic ranks. As expected, our algorithm correctly classified new insect species at higher taxonomic ranks, while classification was uncertain at lower taxonomic ranks. Anomaly detection can effectively flag novel taxa that are visually distinct from species in the training data. However, five novel taxa were consistently mistaken for visually similar species in the training data. Above all, we have demonstrated a practical approach to hierarchical classification based on species taxonomy and uncertainty during automated in situ monitoring of live insects. Our method is simple and versatile and could be implemented to classify a wide range of insects as well as other organisms.\nEpigenetic variation causes heritable variation in complex traits in the mollusk Biomphalaria glabrata, vector of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni\nAuthors: Luviano, N.; Lopez, M.; Gawehns, F.; Haegeman, B.; Mouginot, P.; Chaparro, C.; Arimondo, P. B.; Pujol, B.; Pouzol, D.; Cosseau, C.; Grunau, C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.08.548202\nDNA methylation variation may play a role in phenotypic variation as it can be directly affected by the environment and be inherited. DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84+/-5% but only 68+/-21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47+/-7% in control RILs and 59+/-18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs. We found that the heritability h2 of the fecundity in the epiRILs was between 0.5 and 0.6 depending on the method used to estimate it. We developed a model for introducing epimutant offspring snails into resident susceptible populations. If genetic assimilation of the resistant phenotype occured in a small fraction of the introduced epimutant snails, we predict that the susceptible phenotype is replaced by the resistant phenotype after 50-70 generations.\nAbsence of Coronavirus in terns in the Western Indian Ocean?\nAuthors: Lebarbenchon, C.; Feare, C.; Larose, C.; Boucher, S.; Jaeger, A.; Le Corre, M.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547193\nWe investigated coronavirus circulation in three tern species, in four islands of the Western Indian Ocean (Bird, Reunion, Europa, Juan de Nova).

Sorting with DNA barcodes is an attractive alternative, but needs cost-effective techniques that are suitable for use in many laboratories around the world so that barcoding can be made widely available. Oxford Nanopores portable and inexpensive MinION sequencers are a good option because they allow for reducing the sequencing and capital-cost of a fully functional barcoding laboratory. We here provide an update to the MinION barcoding software ONTbarcoder that is available for commonly used operating systems and includes a GUI. We show that the read quality obtained with ONTs latest basecallers and chemistry (R10.4 flowcells, Q20+ kits) allow for three key improvements. Firstly, ONTbarcoder can now deliver real-time barcoding to complement ONTs real-time sequencing. This means that the first barcodes are obtained within minutes of starting a sequencing run and a significant proportion of barcodes are available before sequencing completes. This real-time feature of ONTbarcoder can be configured to handle both Mk1B and Mk1C. The input is a demultiplexing sheet and base-called or raw data. Secondly, the improved read quality of ONTs latest flow cells (R10.4) allows for the use of primers with shorter indices than what was previously needed (9bp vs. 12-13bp). This decreases primer cost and improves PCR success rates. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the availability of R10.4 chemistry in the low-cost Flongle flowcell is an attractive option for users who require only 200-250 barcodes at a time.\nCompetition for light can drive adverse species-composition shifts in the Amazon Forest under elevated CO2\nAuthors: Joshi, J.; Hofhansl, F.; Singh, S.; Stocker, B.; Brännström, A.; Franklin, O.; Blanco, C. C.; Aleixo, I. F.; Lapola, D. M.; Prentice, I. C.; Dieckmann, U.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547575\nThe resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Aim: to estimate European megafauna diversity and functional declines in the present compared to the nearest in time modern-analogue climate period prior to the worldwide diffusion of Homo sapiens.

Location: Europe.

Time period: Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 127,000 years ago) to present.

Major taxa studied: wild, large ([&amp;ge;]10 kg) terrestrial mammals.

Methods: we assessed the distribution of 48 European megafauna species during the LIG using hindcasting modelling and fossil records. Then, we estimated the decline in megafauna community diversity and potential trait-based functional effects from the LIG to the present, accounting for climate differences between the two periods.

Results: from the LIG to the present, species richness and community biomass across Europe dropped by 74.3% ({&#43;/-} 9.9% SD) and 96.7% ({&#43;/-} 4.1% SD), respectively. Functional diversity dropped by 59.1% ({&#43;/-} 11.8% SD) for herbivores and by 48.2% ({&#43;/-} 25.0% SD) for carnivores, while trait-informed potential vegetation and meat consumptions dropped by 91.1% ({&#43;/-} 7.4% SD) and 61.2% ({&#43;/-} 17.2% SD), respectively. The loss in megafauna diversity and associated ecological processes were high everywhere, but particularly in western Europe for carnivores and in the East European Plain for herbivores. We found that potential megafauna richness and functional patterns in the two periods were near identical if only climate-driven differences were considered.

Main conclusions: severe, size-biased defaunation has degraded megafauna assemblages and megafauna-mediated ecological processes across Europe from the LIG to the present. These patterns cannot be explained by climate differences between the two periods, thus were likely driven by the impact of prehistoric Homo sapiens. The results suggest that the structure of wild ecosystems of the present strongly deviates from the evolutionary norm, notably with decreased functional heterogeneity and decreased fluxes of biogeochemical compounds across the trophic networks, highlighting the importance of ambitious policies of megafauna community restoration to support ecosystems functioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial ecosystems in soils, oceans, and other environments are essential for global ecological stability. Environmental shifts are anticipated to trigger destabilizing events across the planet. In this study, we model how gradual environmental changes impact ecosystems, specifically when leading to a loss of diversity. We investigate how an ecosystem, within a serial-dilution setup, relaxes to a stable steady state. Our results reveal that as an ecosystem approaches its loss of diversity transition, its dynamics slow down. Consequently, diverse ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest soils, gradually driven past their transition point may exhibit a significant response lag. This suggests that some ecosystems may be closer to a collapse in diversity than current observations indicate. Although our model does not capture the full complexity of real-world ecosystems, it highlights critical aspects underlying the loss of biodiversity in changing environments. This has potential implications for empirical studies and when planning interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionHuman habitats remain the main point of human-vector interaction leading to malaria transmission despite sustained use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Simple structural modifications involving screening of doors, windows and eaves have great potential for reducing indoor entry of mosquitoes and hence malaria transmission.

MethodsFour huts, each constructed inside a semi-field structure, allowing the experimental release of mosquitoes at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kisumu research station were used in the study. Two huts had untreated eave and door screens and screened air cavities in place of windows in experiment 1 with the eave screen treated using Actellic(R) insecticide in experiment 2. The other two huts remained unscreened throughout the study. First filial (F1) generation of Anopheles funestus from Siaya, F0 reared from An. arabiensis larvae collected from Ahero and An. arabiensis Dongola strain from the insectary were raised to 3-day old adults and used in experiments. Two hundred, 3-day old adults of each species were released in each semi-field structure at dusk and recaptured the following day at 0700hrs and at 0900 hours. A single volunteer slept in each hut under untreated bed net each night of the study. Recaptured mosquitoes were counted and recorded by collection location, either indoor or outdoor of each hut in the different semi-field structures.

ResultsSignificantly fewer An. arabiensis from Ahero [RR=0.10; (95%CI: 0.02-0.63); P&lt;0.0145], An. arabiensis Dongola strain [RR=0.11; (95%CI: 0.04 - 0.19); P&lt;0.0001 and An. funestus from Siaya [RR=0.10; (95%CI: 0.06-0.17); P&lt;0.0001] were observed inside modified huts compared to unmodified ones. Treating of eave screen material with Actellic(R) 300CS significantly reduced the numbers An. arabiensis from Ahero [RR=0.003; (95%CI: 0.00-0.03); P&lt;0.0001] and An. arabiensis Dongola strain [RR=0.03; (95%CI: 0.02-0.05); P&lt;0.0001] indoors of huts with treated eave screen compared to huts with untreated eave screens, while totally preventing entry of An. funestus indoors. These modifications cost &lt;250usd/structure.

Discussion and ConclusionThis article describes affordable and effective ways of reducing mosquito entry into the house by modifying the eaves, doors and windows. These modifications were highly effective in reducing indoor entry of mosquitoes. Additionally, treatment of eave screen material with an effective insecticide further reduces the Anopheles population in and around the screened huts under semi-field conditions and could greatly complement existing vector control efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The metabolic activity of microbial communities is central to their role in biogeochemical cycles, human health, and biotechnology. Despite the abundance of sequencing data characterizing these consortia, it remains a serious challenge to predict microbial metabolic traits from sequencing data alone. Here we culture 96 bacterial isolates individually and assay their ability to grow on 10 distinct compounds as a sole carbon source. Using these data as well as two existing datasets, we show that statistical approaches can accurately predict bacterial carbon utilization traits from genomes. First, we show that classifiers trained on gene content can accurately predict bacterial carbon utilization phenotypes by encoding phylogenetic information. These models substantially outperform predictions made by constraint-based metabolic models automatically constructed from genomes. However, phylogeny-based predictions fail to predict traits for taxa that are phyloge-netically distant from any strains in the training set. To overcome this we train improved models on gene presence/absence to predict carbon utilization traits from gene content. We show that models that predict carbon utilization traits from gene presence/absence can generalize to taxa that are phylogenetically distant from the training set either by exploiting biochemical information for feature selection or by having sufficiently large datasets. In the latter case, we provide evidence that a statistical approach can identify putatively mechanistic genes involved in metabolic traits. Our study demonstrates the potential power for predicting microbial phenotypes from genotypes using statistical approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bioinvasions have the potential to provoke cascade effects that can disrupt natural ecosystems, and cause ecological regime shifts. The Mediterranean Sea is particularly prone to bioinvasions as the changing water conditions, evoked by climate change, are creating advantageous conditions for Lessepsian migrants from the Red Sea. Recently, in May 2023, a new alien species was documented in the Mediterranean Sea - a soft coral of the genus Dendronephthya. This discovery was made by divers conducting  Long Term Ecological Research surveys, along the coast of Israel, at a depth of 42 m. Genetic and morphological testing were utilized to confirm the species identity as Dendronepthya hemprichi, an Indo-Pacific coral, common in the Red Sea. According to life history traits of this species such as accelerated attachment to available surfaces and fast growth, we expect it to rapidly expand its distribution and abundance across the Mediterranean.

        <p class="abstract">Cameras and computer vision are revolutionising the study of insects, creating new research opportunities within agriculture, epidemiology, evolution, ecology and monitoring of biodiversity. However, a major challenge is the diversity of insects and close resemblances of many species combined with computer vision are often not sufficient to classify large numbers of insect species, which sometimes cannot be identified at the species level. Here, we present an algorithm to hierarchically classify insects from images, leveraging a simple taxonomy to (1) classify specimens across multiple taxonomic ranks simultaneously, and (2) highlight the lowest rank at which a reliable classification can be reached. Specifically, we propose multitask learning, a loss function incorporating class dependency at each taxonomic rank, and anomaly detection based on outlier analysis for quantification of uncertainty. First, we compile a dataset of 41,731 images of insects, combining images from time-lapse monitoring of floral scenes with images from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Second, we adapt state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, ResNet and EfficientNet, for the hierarchical classification of insects belonging to three orders, five families and nine species. Third, we assess model generalization for 11 species unseen by the trained models. Here, anomaly detection is used to predict the higher rank of the species not present in the training set. We found that incorporating a simple taxonomy into our model increased accuracy at higher taxonomic ranks. As expected, our algorithm correctly classified new insect species at higher taxonomic ranks, while classification was uncertain at lower taxonomic ranks. Anomaly detection can effectively flag novel taxa that are visually distinct from species in the training data. However, five novel taxa were consistently mistaken for visually similar species in the training data. Above all, we have demonstrated a practical approach to hierarchical classification based on species taxonomy and uncertainty during automated in situ monitoring of live insects. Our method is simple and versatile and could be implemented to classify a wide range of insects as well as other organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA methylation variation may play a role in phenotypic variation as it can be directly affected by the environment and be inherited. DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84&#43;/-5% but only 68&#43;/-21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47&#43;/-7% in control RILs and 59&#43;/-18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs. We found that the heritability h2 of the fecundity in the epiRILs was between 0.5 and 0.6 depending on the method used to estimate it. We developed a model for introducing epimutant offspring snails into resident susceptible populations. If genetic assimilation of the resistant phenotype occured in a small fraction of the introduced epimutant snails, we predict that the susceptible phenotype is replaced by the resistant phenotype after 50-70 generations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most animal species are undescribed and hidden in biodiversity samples consisting of thousands of specimens that are difficult to sort to species using morphological characters. Sorting with DNA barcodes is an attractive alternative, but needs cost-effective techniques that are suitable for use in many laboratories around the world so that barcoding can be made widely available. Oxford Nanopores portable and inexpensive MinION sequencers are a good option because they allow for reducing the sequencing and capital-cost of a fully functional barcoding laboratory. We here provide an update to the MinION barcoding software ONTbarcoder that is available for commonly used operating systems and includes a GUI. We show that the read quality obtained with ONTs latest basecallers and chemistry (R10.4 flowcells, Q20&#43; kits) allow for three key improvements. Firstly, ONTbarcoder can now deliver real-time barcoding to complement ONTs real-time sequencing. This means that the first barcodes are obtained within minutes of starting a sequencing run and a significant proportion of barcodes are available before sequencing completes. This real-time feature of ONTbarcoder can be configured to handle both Mk1B and Mk1C. The input is a demultiplexing sheet and base-called or raw data. Secondly, the improved read quality of ONTs latest flow cells (R10.4) allows for the use of primers with shorter indices than what was previously needed (9bp vs. 12-13bp). This decreases primer cost and improves PCR success rates. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the availability of R10.4 chemistry in the low-cost Flongle flowcell is an attractive option for users who require only 200-250 barcodes at a time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.</p>
