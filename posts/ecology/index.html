M.\nScore: 96.2, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.560707\nHuman decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

C. C.; Goldford, J.; Estrela, S.; Bajic, D.; Sanchez-Gorostiaga, A.; Damian-Serrano, A.; Lu, N.; Marsland, R.; Rebolleda-Gomez, M.; Mehta, P.; Sanchez, A.\nScore: 54.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.564019\nWhen microbial communities form, their composition is shaped by selective pressures imposed by the environment. Can we predict which communities will assemble under different environmental conditions? Here, we hypothesize that quantitative similarities in metabolic traits across metabolically similar environments lead to predictable similarities in community composition. To that end, we measured the growth rate and by-product profile of a library of proteobacterial strains in a large number of single nutrient environments. We found that growth rates and secretion profiles were positively correlated across environments when the supplied substrate was metabolically similar. By analyzing hundreds of in-vitro communities experimentally assembled in an array of different synthetic environments, we then show that metabolically similar substrates select for taxonomically similar communities. These findings lead us to propose and then validate a comparative approach for quantitatively predicting the effects of novel substrates on the composition of complex microbial consortia.\nGlobal abundance patterns, diversity, and ecology of Patescibacteria in wastewater treatment plants\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Hu, H.; Kristensen, J. M.; Pjevac, P.; Kitzinger, K.; Herbold, C. W.; Hausmann, B.; Dueholm, M. K. D.; Nielsen, P. H.\nScore: 53.7, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.562895\nMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning. Here, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter. Our study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.\nThe Moa the Merrier: Resolving When the Dinornithiformes Went Extinct\nAuthors: Foxon, F.\nScore: 43.6, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552261\nThe Moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) are an extinct group of the ratite clade from New Zealand. The overkill hypothesis asserts that the first New Zealand settlers hunted the Moa to extinction by 1450 CE, whereas the staggered survival hypothesis allows for Moa survival until after Europeans began to arrive on New Zealand. Alleged Moa sightings post-1450 CE may shed light on these competing hypotheses. A dataset of 97 alleged Moa sightings from circa 1675 CE to 1993 CE was constructed, with sightings given subjective quality ratings corresponding to various statistical probabilities. Cumulative probabilities of Moa persistence were calculated with a conservative survival model using these probabilistic sighting-records; a method recently applied to sightings of the Thylacine. Cumulative persistence probability fell sharply after 1408 CE, and across pessimistic and optimistic variations of the model, it was more likely than not that the Moa were extinct by 1770 CE. Probabilistic sighting-record models favour the overkill hypothesis, and give very low probabilities of Moa persistence around the time of European arrival. Eyewitness data on Moa sightings are amenable to scientific study, and these methods may be applied to similar animals.\nThe Atlantic Forest of South America: spatiotemporal dynamics of remaining vegetation and implications for conservation\nAuthors: Vancine, M. H.; Muylaert, R. L.; Niebuhr, B. B.; Oshima, J. E. d. F.; Tonetti, V.; Bernardo, R.; De Angelo, C.; Rosa, M. R.; Grohmann, C. H.; Ribeiro, M. C.\nScore: 19.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558076\nThe Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 36% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (\u003e500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (\u003c50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is \u003c90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250-830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (\u003e10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future. HighlightsO_LIThere is 23% forest and 36% natural vegetation cover remaining in the Atlantic Forest. C_LIO_LIBetween 1986-2020, native forest cover decreased by 2.4% and natural vegetation by 3.6%.

I.; Pradhan, K.; Hille Ris Lambers, J.; Angert, A. L.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563861\nClimate change is causing many species ranges to shift upslope to higher elevations as species track their climatic requirements. However, many species have not shifted in pace with recent warming (i.e., range stasis), possibly due either to demographic lags or microclimatic buffering. The lagged-response hypothesis posits that range stasis disguises an underlying climatic sensitivity if range shifts lag the velocity of climate change due to slow colonization or mortality. Alternatively, the microclimatic buffering hypothesis proposes that small-scale variation within the landscape, such as canopy cover, creates patches of suitable habitat within otherwise unsuitable macroclimates that create climate refugia and buffer range contractions. To test these two hypotheses, we combined a large seed addition experiment of 25 plant species across macro- and micro-scale climate gradients with local herbaria records to compare patterns of seedling recruitment relative to adult ranges and microclimate in the North Cascades, USA. Despite high species-to-species variability in recruitment, community-level patterns supported the lagged response hypothesis, with a mismatch between where recruitment vs. adults occur. On average, the seedling recruitment optimum shifted from the adult climatic range centre to historically cooler, wetter regions and many species recruited beyond their cold (e.g., leading) range edge. Meanwhile, successful recruitment at warm and dry edges, despite recent climate change, suggests that macroclimatic effects on recruitment do not drive trailing range dynamics. By contrast, we were unable to detect evidence of microclimatic buffering due to canopy cover. Combined, our results suggest apparent range stasis in our system is a lagged response to climate change at the cool ends of species ranges, with range expansions likely to occur slowly or in a punctuated fashion.\nAssessing the overlap between fishing activities and chondrichthyans distribution exposes high-risk areas for bycatch of threatened species\nAuthors: Maioli, F.; Weigel, B.; Lindmark, M.; Manfredi, C.; Zupa, W.; Bitetto, I.; Russo, T.; Casini, M.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563919\nSharks, rays, and chimaeras (chondrichthyans) play a crucial role in marine ecosystem functioning but are highly vulnerable to fishing. Hence, understanding the spatial overlap between chondrichthyans and fishing effort is essential for effective conservation and management. Here, we propose an integrated approach that combines Vessel Monitoring System data with geostatistical species distribution models to assess the potential impact of fishing on chondrichthyan populations in the western Adriatic Sea. By mapping the overlap between model-based chondrichthyan distribution, species richness, and the proportion of threatened species with bottom trawl fishing activities, we identify areas at high risk for chondrichthyan bycatch. Our findings show that many of these species are at risk across a large part of their distribution within the study area. Notably, there is a substantial spatial overlap between regions where threatened chondrichthyans are found and species-rich areas with locations of intensive bottom trawl fishing in the northern and central offshore regions of the western Adriatic, emphasizing the vulnerability of these species to fishing pressure. Furthermore, differences in overlap between distinct fishing gears highlight the importance of considering specific fishing practices when formulating management strategies. While our work provides novel insights to potential bycatch hotspots, limitations related to data sources, spatial resolution, and the inability to directly quantify fishing impacts should be considered. Nonetheless, our findings contribute to the development of targeted conservation and spatial management measures, offering a general approach to study model-based spatial hotspots aimed at protecting and sustaining chondrichthyan populations in the heavily exploited Adriatic Sea.\nImproving forest ecosystem functions by optimizing tree species spatial arrangement\nAuthors: Beugnon, R.; Albert, G.; Hahn, G.; Haider, S.; Hattenschwiler, S.; Davrinche, A.; Rosenbaum, B.; Gauzens, B.; Eisenhauer, N.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563583\nReforestation and afforestation programs are promoted as strategies to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enhance ecosystem services. Planting diverse forests is supposed to foster such benefits, but optimal tree planting techniques, especially regarding species spatial arrangement, are underexplored. Here, using field measurements from the subtropical BEF-China experiment, we simulated leaf litterfall and decomposition, as a function of various spatial arrangements of tree species, from clusters of species to random distributions. We show that increasing tree species spatial heterogeneity in forests composed of nine tree species led to more evenly distributed litterfall, increased litter decomposition and associated nitrogen cycling by 45%. These effects were amplified with increasing plot species richness, while species functional trait identity and diversity modulated these relationships. The spatial arrangement of tree species is a critical component determining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, and considering such spatial aspects is crucial for operationalizing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory in realistic re-/afforestation projects.\nLysogeny destabilizes computationally simulated microbiomes\nAuthors: Gilman, R. T.; Muldoon, M. R.; Megremis, S.; Robertson, D. L.; Chanishvili, N.; Papadopoulos, N. G.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563560\nBackgroundThe Anna Karenina Principle predicts that stability in host-associated microbiomes correlates with health in the host. Microbiomes are ecosystems, and classical ecological theory suggests that predators impact ecosystem stability. Phages can act as predators on bacterial species in microbiomes. However, our ability to extrapolate results from existing ecological theory to phages and microbiomes is limited because some phages can stage lysogenic infections, a process with no precise analog in classical ecology. In lysogenic infections, so-called \"temperate\" phages integrate into the cells of their hosts where they can remain dormant as prophages for many generations. Prophages can later be induced by environmental conditions, whereupon they lyse their host cells and phage progeny are released. It has been suggested that prophages can act as biological timebombs that destabilize microbial ecosystems, but formal theory to support this hypothesis is lacking. ResultsWe studied the effects of temperate and virulent phages on diversity and stability in computationally simulated microbiomes. The presence of either phage type in a microbiome increased bacterial diversity. Bacterial populations were more likely to fluctuate over time when there were more temperate phages in the system. When microbiomes were disturbed from their steady states, both phage types affected return times, but in different ways. Bacterial species returned to their pre-disturbance densities more slowly when there were more temperate phage species, but cycles engendered by disturbances dampened more slowly when there were more virulent phage species. ConclusionsPhages shape the diversity and stability of microbiomes, and temperate and virulent phages impact microbiomes in different ways. A clear understanding of the effects of phage life cycles on microbiome dynamics is needed to predict the role of microbiome composition in host health, and for applications including phage therapy and microbiome transplants. The results we present here provide a theoretical foundation for this body of work.\nBiophysical constraints on avian adaptation and diversification\nAuthors: Sayol, F.; Reijenga, B.; Tobias, J.; Pigot, A. L.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564103\nThe capacity of organisms to adapt to vacant niches or changing environments is limited by physical constraints on morphological evolution. Substantial progress has been made in identifying how these constraints shape the form and function of producers (plants), but our understanding of evolutionary limits in consumers (animals) remains highly limited, in part because the requisite data have not been available at sufficient scale. Using morphometric measurements for all birds, we demonstrate that observed variation is highly restricted, both for beak shape and overall body shape, to triangular regions of morphospace with clearly defined boundaries and vertices. By combining morphometric data with new information on physical functions of measured traits, we provide evidence that the extent of avian morphospace is constrained by biophysical trade-offs between three functional objectives (strength, reach and engulfment capacity) that characterize resource acquisition and processing by the beak, and three locomotory modalities (aerial, aquatic and terrestrial) that characterize avian lifestyles. Our results suggest that over avian evolutionary history, trajectories of morphological change trend towards the vertices, with birds evolving from a core of biophysical generalists to biophysical specialists, associated with faster macroevolutionary turnover of lineages at the periphery or morphospace. Our analyses reveal that the structure of avian morphological diversity follows relatively simple rules defined by biophysical constraints and trade-offs, shedding light on the process shaping modern animal diversity and responses to environmental change.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Human decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have-nots&#34;, with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

        <p class="abstract">When microbial communities form, their composition is shaped by selective pressures imposed by the environment. Can we predict which communities will assemble under different environmental conditions? Here, we hypothesize that quantitative similarities in metabolic traits across metabolically similar environments lead to predictable similarities in community composition. To that end, we measured the growth rate and by-product profile of a library of proteobacterial strains in a large number of single nutrient environments. We found that growth rates and secretion profiles were positively correlated across environments when the supplied substrate was metabolically similar. By analyzing hundreds of in-vitro communities experimentally assembled in an array of different synthetic environments, we then show that metabolically similar substrates select for taxonomically similar communities. These findings lead us to propose and then validate a comparative approach for quantitatively predicting the effects of novel substrates on the composition of complex microbial consortia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning. Here, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter. Our study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) are an extinct group of the ratite clade from New Zealand. The overkill hypothesis asserts that the first New Zealand settlers hunted the Moa to extinction by 1450 CE, whereas the staggered survival hypothesis allows for Moa survival until after Europeans began to arrive on New Zealand. Alleged Moa sightings post-1450 CE may shed light on these competing hypotheses. A dataset of 97 alleged Moa sightings from circa 1675 CE to 1993 CE was constructed, with sightings given subjective quality ratings corresponding to various statistical probabilities. Cumulative probabilities of Moa persistence were calculated with a conservative survival model using these probabilistic sighting-records; a method recently applied to sightings of the Thylacine. Cumulative persistence probability fell sharply after 1408 CE, and across pessimistic and optimistic variations of the model, it was more likely than not that the Moa were extinct by 1770 CE. Probabilistic sighting-record models favour the overkill hypothesis, and give very low probabilities of Moa persistence around the time of European arrival. Eyewitness data on Moa sightings are amenable to scientific study, and these methods may be applied to similar animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 36% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (&gt;500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (&lt;50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is &lt;90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250-830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (&gt;10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future.

        <p class="abstract">Climate change is causing many species ranges to shift upslope to higher elevations as species track their climatic requirements. However, many species have not shifted in pace with recent warming (i.e., range stasis), possibly due either to demographic lags or microclimatic buffering. The lagged-response hypothesis posits that range stasis disguises an underlying climatic sensitivity if range shifts lag the velocity of climate change due to slow colonization or mortality. Alternatively, the microclimatic buffering hypothesis proposes that small-scale variation within the landscape, such as canopy cover, creates patches of suitable habitat within otherwise unsuitable macroclimates that create climate refugia and buffer range contractions. To test these two hypotheses, we combined a large seed addition experiment of 25 plant species across macro- and micro-scale climate gradients with local herbaria records to compare patterns of seedling recruitment relative to adult ranges and microclimate in the North Cascades, USA. Despite high species-to-species variability in recruitment, community-level patterns supported the lagged response hypothesis, with a mismatch between where recruitment vs. adults occur. On average, the seedling recruitment optimum shifted from the adult climatic range centre to historically cooler, wetter regions and many species recruited beyond their cold (e.g., leading) range edge. Meanwhile, successful recruitment at warm and dry edges, despite recent climate change, suggests that macroclimatic effects on recruitment do not drive trailing range dynamics. By contrast, we were unable to detect evidence of microclimatic buffering due to canopy cover. Combined, our results suggest apparent range stasis in our system is a lagged response to climate change at the cool ends of species ranges, with range expansions likely to occur slowly or in a punctuated fashion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (chondrichthyans) play a crucial role in marine ecosystem functioning but are highly vulnerable to fishing. Hence, understanding the spatial overlap between chondrichthyans and fishing effort is essential for effective conservation and management. Here, we propose an integrated approach that combines Vessel Monitoring System data with geostatistical species distribution models to assess the potential impact of fishing on chondrichthyan populations in the western Adriatic Sea. By mapping the overlap between model-based chondrichthyan distribution, species richness, and the proportion of threatened species with bottom trawl fishing activities, we identify areas at high risk for chondrichthyan bycatch. Our findings show that many of these species are at risk across a large part of their distribution within the study area. Notably, there is a substantial spatial overlap between regions where threatened chondrichthyans are found and species-rich areas with locations of intensive bottom trawl fishing in the northern and central offshore regions of the western Adriatic, emphasizing the vulnerability of these species to fishing pressure. Furthermore, differences in overlap between distinct fishing gears highlight the importance of considering specific fishing practices when formulating management strategies. While our work provides novel insights to potential bycatch hotspots, limitations related to data sources, spatial resolution, and the inability to directly quantify fishing impacts should be considered. Nonetheless, our findings contribute to the development of targeted conservation and spatial management measures, offering a general approach to study model-based spatial hotspots aimed at protecting and sustaining chondrichthyan populations in the heavily exploited Adriatic Sea.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reforestation and afforestation programs are promoted as strategies to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enhance ecosystem services. Planting diverse forests is supposed to foster such benefits, but optimal tree planting techniques, especially regarding species spatial arrangement, are underexplored.

Here, using field measurements from the subtropical BEF-China experiment, we simulated leaf litterfall and decomposition, as a function of various spatial arrangements of tree species, from clusters of species to random distributions.

We show that increasing tree species spatial heterogeneity in forests composed of nine tree species led to more evenly distributed litterfall, increased litter decomposition and associated nitrogen cycling by 45%. These effects were amplified with increasing plot species richness, while species functional trait identity and diversity modulated these relationships.

The spatial arrangement of tree species is a critical component determining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, and considering such spatial aspects is crucial for operationalizing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory in realistic re-/afforestation projects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Anna Karenina Principle predicts that stability in host-associated microbiomes correlates with health in the host. Microbiomes are ecosystems, and classical ecological theory suggests that predators impact ecosystem stability. Phages can act as predators on bacterial species in microbiomes. However, our ability to extrapolate results from existing ecological theory to phages and microbiomes is limited because some phages can stage lysogenic infections, a process with no precise analog in classical ecology. In lysogenic infections, so-called &#34;temperate&#34; phages integrate into the cells of their hosts where they can remain dormant as prophages for many generations. Prophages can later be induced by environmental conditions, whereupon they lyse their host cells and phage progeny are released. It has been suggested that prophages can act as biological timebombs that destabilize microbial ecosystems, but formal theory to support this hypothesis is lacking.

ResultsWe studied the effects of temperate and virulent phages on diversity and stability in computationally simulated microbiomes. The presence of either phage type in a microbiome increased bacterial diversity. Bacterial populations were more likely to fluctuate over time when there were more temperate phages in the system. When microbiomes were disturbed from their steady states, both phage types affected return times, but in different ways. Bacterial species returned to their pre-disturbance densities more slowly when there were more temperate phage species, but cycles engendered by disturbances dampened more slowly when there were more virulent phage species.

ConclusionsPhages shape the diversity and stability of microbiomes, and temperate and virulent phages impact microbiomes in different ways. A clear understanding of the effects of phage life cycles on microbiome dynamics is needed to predict the role of microbiome composition in host health, and for applications including phage therapy and microbiome transplants. The results we present here provide a theoretical foundation for this body of work.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The capacity of organisms to adapt to vacant niches or changing environments is limited by physical constraints on morphological evolution. Substantial progress has been made in identifying how these constraints shape the form and function of producers (plants), but our understanding of evolutionary limits in consumers (animals) remains highly limited, in part because the requisite data have not been available at sufficient scale. Using morphometric measurements for all birds, we demonstrate that observed variation is highly restricted, both for beak shape and overall body shape, to triangular regions of morphospace with clearly defined boundaries and vertices. By combining morphometric data with new information on physical functions of measured traits, we provide evidence that the extent of avian morphospace is constrained by biophysical trade-offs between three functional objectives (strength, reach and engulfment capacity) that characterize resource acquisition and processing by the beak, and three locomotory modalities (aerial, aquatic and terrestrial) that characterize avian lifestyles. Our results suggest that over avian evolutionary history, trajectories of morphological change trend towards the vertices, with birds evolving from a core of biophysical generalists to biophysical specialists, associated with faster macroevolutionary turnover of lineages at the periphery or morphospace. Our analyses reveal that the structure of avian morphological diversity follows relatively simple rules defined by biophysical constraints and trade-offs, shedding light on the process shaping modern animal diversity and responses to environmental change.</p>
