In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.\nGlobal meta-analysis reveals overall benefits of silvopastoral systems for biodiversity\nAuthors: Perez-Alvarez, R.; Chara, J.; Snyder, L. D.; Bonatti, M.; Sieber, S.; Martin, E. A.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551160\nDomestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the worlds terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.\nEyes on nature: Embedded vision cameras for multidisciplinary biodiversity monitoring\nAuthors: Darras, K. F. A.; Balle, M.; Xu, W.; Yan, Y.; Zakka, V. G.; Toledo-Hernandez, M.; Sheng, D.; Lin, W.; Zhang, B.; Lan, Z.; Fupeng, L.; Wanger, T. C.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550656\nGlobal environmental challenges require comprehensive data to manage and protect biodiversity. Currently, vision-based biodiversity monitoring efforts are mixed, incomplete, human-dependent, and passive. To tackle these issues, we present a portable, modular, low-power device with embedded vision for biodiversity monitoring. Our camera uses interchangeable lenses to resolve barely visible and remote subjects, as well as customisable algorithms for blob detection, region-of-interest classification, and object detection to identify targets. We showcase our system in six case studies from the ethology, landscape ecology, agronomy, pollination ecology, conservation biology, and phenology disciplines. Using the same devices, we discovered bats feeding on durian tree flowers, monitored flying bats and their insect prey, identified nocturnal insect pests in paddy fields, detected bees visiting rapeseed crop flowers, triggered real-time alerts for waterbirds, and tracked flower phenology over months. We measured classification accuracies between 55% and 96% in our field surveys and used them to standardise observations over highly-resolved time scales. The cameras are amenable to situations where automated vision-based monitoring is required off the grid, in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and in particular for quantifying species interactions. Embedded vision devices such as this will help addressing global biodiversity challenges and facilitate a technology-aided global food systems transformation.\nMetabolic complexity drives divergence in microbial communities\nAuthors: Silverstein, M. R.; Bhatnagar, J. M.; Segre, D.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551516\nMicrobial communities are shaped by the metabolites available in their environment, but the principles that govern whether different communities will converge or diverge in any given condition remain unknown, posing fundamental questions about the feasibility of microbiome engineering. To this end, we studied the longitudinal assembly dynamics of a set of natural microbial communities grown in laboratory conditions of increasing metabolic complexity. We found that different microbial communities tend to become similar to each other when grown in metabolically simple conditions, but diverge in composition as the metabolic complexity of the environment increases, a phenomenon we refer to as the divergence-complexity effect. A comparative analysis of these communities revealed that this divergence is driven by community diversity and by the diverse assortment of specialist taxa capable of degrading complex metabolites. An ecological model of community dynamics indicates that the hierarchical structure of metabolism itself, where complex molecules are enzymatically degraded into progressively smaller ones, is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate all of our experimental observations. In addition to pointing to a fundamental principle of community assembly, the divergence-complexity effect has important implications for microbiome engineering applications, as it can provide insight into which environments support multiple community states, enabling the search for desired ecosystem functions.\nMacroecological laws in experimental microbial systems\nAuthors: Shoemaker, W. R.; Sanchez, A.; Grilli, J.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550281\nHistorically, ecology has benefited by characterizing statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities. This approach, known as macroecology, has achieved considerable success in microbial ecology in recent years, having identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models that do not require interactions between community members. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role in the fields development, as the manipulation of high-replication time-series has revealed novel forces that govern community dynamics. However, there remains a gap between microbial experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems. Here, we work to bridge the gap between the experimental manipulation of communities and their macroecological effects. Using high-replication time-series of experimental microbial communities, we demonstrate that macroecological laws observed in nature can be readily recapitulated in a laboratory setting and unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We find that demographic manipulations and their effect on community-level variation can alter empirical patterns in a manner that diverges from our predictions, though the predictive capacity of the SLM can be restored by incorporating explicit experimental details. Finally, we demonstrate the extent that experimental manipulations are capable of altering macroecological patterns under the SLM, establishing a demarcation between macroecological effects we can and cannot observe in a laboratory setting.\nGrow now, pay later: when should a bacterium go into debt?\nAuthors: Lopez, J. G.; Erez, A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550682\nMicrobes grow in a wide variety of environments and must balance growth and stress resistance. Despite the prevalence of such trade-offs, understanding of their role in non-steady environments is limited. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model of \"growth debt\", where microbes grow rapidly initially, paying later with slower growth or heightened mortality. We first compare our model to a classical chemostat experiment, validating our proposed dynamics and quantifying Escherichia colis stress resistance dynamics. Extending the chemostat theory to include serial-dilution cultures, we derive phase diagrams for the persistence of \"debtor\" microbes. We find that debtors cannot coexist with non-debtors if \"payment\" is increased mortality but can coexist if it lowers enzyme affinity. Surprisingly, weak noise considerably extends the persistence of resistance elements, pertinent for antibiotic management. Our microbial debt theory, broadly applicable across many environments, bridges the gap between chemostat and serial dilution systems.\nPhenological mismatch between trees and wildflowers: Reconciling divergent findings in two recent analyses\nAuthors: Lee, B. R.; Alecrim, E. F.; Forrest, J. R. K.; Heberling, J. M.; Primack, R. B.; Sargent, R. D.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551551\nO_LIRecent evidence suggests that community science and herbarium datasets yield similar estimates of species phenological sensitivities to temperature. Despite this, two recent studies by Alecrim et al. (2023) and Miller et al. (2022) found contradictory results when investigating an identical ecological mechanism (phenological mismatch of wildflower flowering and of shading by deciduous trees; \"phenological escape\") with separate datasets. C_LIO_LIHere, we investigated whether differences between the two studies results could be reconciled by testing four hypotheses related to model design, species selection, spatiotemporal data extent, and phenophase selection. C_LIO_LIHybrid model structures brought results from the two datasets closer together but did not fully reconcile the differences between the studies. Cropping the datasets to match spatial and temporal extents appeared to reconcile most differences but only at the cost of much higher uncertainty associated with reduced sample size. Neither species selection nor phenophase selection seemed to be responsible for differences in results. C_LIO_LISynthesis: Our analysis suggests that although species-level estimates of phenological sensitivity may be similar between crowd-sourced and herbarium datasets, inherent differences in the types and extent of data may lead to contradictory inference about complex biotic interactions. We conclude that, until community science data repositories grow to match the range of climate conditions present in herbarium collections or until herbarium collections grow to match the spatial extent and temporal frequency of community science repositories, ecological studies should ideally be evaluated using both datasets to test the possibility of biased results from either. C_LI\nFunctional traits fail to predict long-term responses to climate change\nAuthors: Ash, J. D.; Li, D.; Johnson, S. E.; Rogers, D. A.; Waller, D. M.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550868\nAimEnvironmental conditions strongly affect the distribution and abundance of species via complex forces. Shifts in environmental conditions and differences in the speed and scale of these effects complicate our efforts to infer how species will respond to future environmental change. We test how 18 functional traits affect plant species responses to gradients in environmental conditions and 50-year shifts in climate. LocationWe analyzed 50-year shifts in the distribution and abundance of 153 plant species distributed across 284 sites in Wisconsin, USA. Time period1950s to 2000s. Major taxa studiedVascular plants (much of the flora of NE North America). MethodsWe used random forest and integrated hierarchical mixed models to test how plant abundances (and 50-year changes in abundance) track gradients in overstory, soil, and climatic conditions. ResultsWithin study periods, plant abundances reflect gradients in environmental conditions. Leaf traits affected local abundance (both directly and via trait-environment interactions) in the 1950s and 2000s. Strong soil and temperature effects in the 1950s have weakened while precipitation effects have strengthened. Although we expected these models to also predict how plants would respond to shifts in climate, they did not. Main conclusionsLags in species responses, increases in the stochastic forces affecting community assembly, and other forces limit the ability of models fitted to static data (e.g., space-for-time substitutions) to predict how plant species will respond to long-term shifts in environmental conditions. We must therefore be cautious about applying trait-based species distribution models to predict how climate change will affect species distributions and community structure.\nAn individual-based simulation framework exploring the ecology and mechanistic underpinnings of larval crowding in laboratory populations of Drosophila\nAuthors: Venkitachalam, S.; Joshi, A.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551144\nThe study of larval competition in laboratory populations of Drosophila, implemented via the crowding of larval cultures, has contributed greatly to the understanding of the ecology of competition, the evolution of larval competitive ability, and formed the basis of rigorous testing of the theory of density-dependent selection. Earlier studies led to the view that the outcomes of larval competition, and resulting evolutionary consequences of crowding-adaptation, could largely be understood by varying the starting density of individuals in a crowded culture. However, recent studies have shown that the results of adaptation to larval crowding may not be well predicted by the total larval density (i.e., total starting individuals/total volume of food). Cultures raised at the same total density but at different egg number and food volume combinations were shown to have different underlying density-specific fitness functions, and crowding-adaptation in each of these cultures was attained through different evolutionary trajectories as well. A recent study showed that cultures with not just the same density, but the same egg and food volume combination, achieved through food columns of differing diameter and height, could also differ greatly in fitness-related trait outcomes. In that study, the density of larvae in the feeding band (volume of food close to the surface in contact with air, to which larval feeding is largely restricted) was a very important factor in predicting the outcomes of larval competition. Given these recent findings, it is important to understand the overall role of feeding band density, and how it influences density-specific fitness functions in different kinds of crowded cultures. As the older models of larval competition are now insufficient to capture current empirical data, we constructed an individual-based simulation framework informed in part by these more recent findings, in order to better understand the evolutionary ecology and mechanistic underpinnings of larval competition, and predict robust experiments for expanding our understanding of the process of larval competition in Drosophila.\nVeni, vidi, vici? Future spread and ecological impacts of a rapidly-expanding invasive predator population\nAuthors: Nelsen, D. R.; Corbit, A. G.; Chuang, A.; Deitsch, J. F.; Sitvarin, M. I.; Coyle, D. R.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551166\nEconomic and ecological consequences of invasive species make biological invasions an influential driver of global change. Monitoring the spread and impacts of non-native species is essential, but often difficult, especially during the initial stages of invasion. The Joro spider, Trichonephila clavata (L. Koch, 1878, Araneae: Araneidae), is a large-bodied orb weaver native to Asia, likely introduced to northern Georgia, U.S. around 2010. We investigated the nascent invasion of T. clavata by constructing species distribution models (SDMs) from crowdsourced data to compare the climate T. clavata experiences in its native range to its introduced range. We found evidence that the climate of T. clavatas native range differs significantly from its introduced range and that the most similar climate in North America to its native range is to the north of its current introduced range. We then compared the SDM predictions to current observations of spread. Consistent with predictions, T. clavata appears to be spreading faster to the north than to the south. Lastly, we conducted surveys to investigate potential ecological impacts of T. clavata on the diversity of native orb weaving spiders. Importantly, Trichonephila clavata was the most common and abundant species observed in the survey, and was numerically dominant at half of the sites it was present in. Our models also suggest that there is lower native orb weaver species richness and diversity closer to where T. clavata was initially found and where it has been established the longest, though human population density complicates this finding. This early study is the first to forecast how widely this spider may spread in its introduced range and explore potential ecological impacts of T. clavata, and we call for continued investigation of this invasions effects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A central challenge in community ecology is predicting the effects of abiotic factors on community assembly. In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Domestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the worlds terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global environmental challenges require comprehensive data to manage and protect biodiversity. Currently, vision-based biodiversity monitoring efforts are mixed, incomplete, human-dependent, and passive. To tackle these issues, we present a portable, modular, low-power device with embedded vision for biodiversity monitoring. Our camera uses interchangeable lenses to resolve barely visible and remote subjects, as well as customisable algorithms for blob detection, region-of-interest classification, and object detection to identify targets. We showcase our system in six case studies from the ethology, landscape ecology, agronomy, pollination ecology, conservation biology, and phenology disciplines. Using the same devices, we discovered bats feeding on durian tree flowers, monitored flying bats and their insect prey, identified nocturnal insect pests in paddy fields, detected bees visiting rapeseed crop flowers, triggered real-time alerts for waterbirds, and tracked flower phenology over months. We measured classification accuracies between 55% and 96% in our field surveys and used them to standardise observations over highly-resolved time scales. The cameras are amenable to situations where automated vision-based monitoring is required off the grid, in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and in particular for quantifying species interactions. Embedded vision devices such as this will help addressing global biodiversity challenges and facilitate a technology-aided global food systems transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial communities are shaped by the metabolites available in their environment, but the principles that govern whether different communities will converge or diverge in any given condition remain unknown, posing fundamental questions about the feasibility of microbiome engineering. To this end, we studied the longitudinal assembly dynamics of a set of natural microbial communities grown in laboratory conditions of increasing metabolic complexity. We found that different microbial communities tend to become similar to each other when grown in metabolically simple conditions, but diverge in composition as the metabolic complexity of the environment increases, a phenomenon we refer to as the divergence-complexity effect. A comparative analysis of these communities revealed that this divergence is driven by community diversity and by the diverse assortment of specialist taxa capable of degrading complex metabolites. An ecological model of community dynamics indicates that the hierarchical structure of metabolism itself, where complex molecules are enzymatically degraded into progressively smaller ones, is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate all of our experimental observations. In addition to pointing to a fundamental principle of community assembly, the divergence-complexity effect has important implications for microbiome engineering applications, as it can provide insight into which environments support multiple community states, enabling the search for desired ecosystem functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Historically, ecology has benefited by characterizing statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities. This approach, known as macroecology, has achieved considerable success in microbial ecology in recent years, having identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models that do not require interactions between community members. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role in the fields development, as the manipulation of high-replication time-series has revealed novel forces that govern community dynamics. However, there remains a gap between microbial experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems. Here, we work to bridge the gap between the experimental manipulation of communities and their macroecological effects. Using high-replication time-series of experimental microbial communities, we demonstrate that macroecological laws observed in nature can be readily recapitulated in a laboratory setting and unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We find that demographic manipulations and their effect on community-level variation can alter empirical patterns in a manner that diverges from our predictions, though the predictive capacity of the SLM can be restored by incorporating explicit experimental details. Finally, we demonstrate the extent that experimental manipulations are capable of altering macroecological patterns under the SLM, establishing a demarcation between macroecological effects we can and cannot observe in a laboratory setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbes grow in a wide variety of environments and must balance growth and stress resistance. Despite the prevalence of such trade-offs, understanding of their role in non-steady environments is limited. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model of &#34;growth debt&#34;, where microbes grow rapidly initially, paying later with slower growth or heightened mortality. We first compare our model to a classical chemostat experiment, validating our proposed dynamics and quantifying Escherichia colis stress resistance dynamics. Extending the chemostat theory to include serial-dilution cultures, we derive phase diagrams for the persistence of &#34;debtor&#34; microbes. We find that debtors cannot coexist with non-debtors if &#34;payment&#34; is increased mortality but can coexist if it lowers enzyme affinity. Surprisingly, weak noise considerably extends the persistence of resistance elements, pertinent for antibiotic management. Our microbial debt theory, broadly applicable across many environments, bridges the gap between chemostat and serial dilution systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIRecent evidence suggests that community science and herbarium datasets yield similar estimates of species phenological sensitivities to temperature. Despite this, two recent studies by Alecrim et al. (2023) and Miller et al. (2022) found contradictory results when investigating an identical ecological mechanism (phenological mismatch of wildflower flowering and of shading by deciduous trees; &#34;phenological escape&#34;) with separate datasets.
C_LIO_LIHere, we investigated whether differences between the two studies results could be reconciled by testing four hypotheses related to model design, species selection, spatiotemporal data extent, and phenophase selection.
C_LIO_LIHybrid model structures brought results from the two datasets closer together but did not fully reconcile the differences between the studies. Cropping the datasets to match spatial and temporal extents appeared to reconcile most differences but only at the cost of much higher uncertainty associated with reduced sample size. Neither species selection nor phenophase selection seemed to be responsible for differences in results.
C_LIO_LISynthesis: Our analysis suggests that although species-level estimates of phenological sensitivity may be similar between crowd-sourced and herbarium datasets, inherent differences in the types and extent of data may lead to contradictory inference about complex biotic interactions. We conclude that, until community science data repositories grow to match the range of climate conditions present in herbarium collections or until herbarium collections grow to match the spatial extent and temporal frequency of community science repositories, ecological studies should ideally be evaluated using both datasets to test the possibility of biased results from either.

        <p class="abstract">AimEnvironmental conditions strongly affect the distribution and abundance of species via complex forces. Shifts in environmental conditions and differences in the speed and scale of these effects complicate our efforts to infer how species will respond to future environmental change. We test how 18 functional traits affect plant species responses to gradients in environmental conditions and 50-year shifts in climate.

LocationWe analyzed 50-year shifts in the distribution and abundance of 153 plant species distributed across 284 sites in Wisconsin, USA.

Time period1950s to 2000s.

Major taxa studiedVascular plants (much of the flora of NE North America).

MethodsWe used random forest and integrated hierarchical mixed models to test how plant abundances (and 50-year changes in abundance) track gradients in overstory, soil, and climatic conditions.

ResultsWithin study periods, plant abundances reflect gradients in environmental conditions. Leaf traits affected local abundance (both directly and via trait-environment interactions) in the 1950s and 2000s. Strong soil and temperature effects in the 1950s have weakened while precipitation effects have strengthened. Although we expected these models to also predict how plants would respond to shifts in climate, they did not.

Main conclusionsLags in species responses, increases in the stochastic forces affecting community assembly, and other forces limit the ability of models fitted to static data (e.g., space-for-time substitutions) to predict how plant species will respond to long-term shifts in environmental conditions. We must therefore be cautious about applying trait-based species distribution models to predict how climate change will affect species distributions and community structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The study of larval competition in laboratory populations of Drosophila, implemented via the crowding of larval cultures, has contributed greatly to the understanding of the ecology of competition, the evolution of larval competitive ability, and formed the basis of rigorous testing of the theory of density-dependent selection. Earlier studies led to the view that the outcomes of larval competition, and resulting evolutionary consequences of crowding-adaptation, could largely be understood by varying the starting density of individuals in a crowded culture. However, recent studies have shown that the results of adaptation to larval crowding may not be well predicted by the total larval density (i.e., total starting individuals/total volume of food). Cultures raised at the same total density but at different egg number and food volume combinations were shown to have different underlying density-specific fitness functions, and crowding-adaptation in each of these cultures was attained through different evolutionary trajectories as well. A recent study showed that cultures with not just the same density, but the same egg and food volume combination, achieved through food columns of differing diameter and height, could also differ greatly in fitness-related trait outcomes. In that study, the density of larvae in the feeding band (volume of food close to the surface in contact with air, to which larval feeding is largely restricted) was a very important factor in predicting the outcomes of larval competition. Given these recent findings, it is important to understand the overall role of feeding band density, and how it influences density-specific fitness functions in different kinds of crowded cultures. As the older models of larval competition are now insufficient to capture current empirical data, we constructed an individual-based simulation framework informed in part by these more recent findings, in order to better understand the evolutionary ecology and mechanistic underpinnings of larval competition, and predict robust experiments for expanding our understanding of the process of larval competition in Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Economic and ecological consequences of invasive species make biological invasions an influential driver of global change. Monitoring the spread and impacts of non-native species is essential, but often difficult, especially during the initial stages of invasion. The Joro spider, Trichonephila clavata (L. Koch, 1878, Araneae: Araneidae), is a large-bodied orb weaver native to Asia, likely introduced to northern Georgia, U.S. around 2010. We investigated the nascent invasion of T. clavata by constructing species distribution models (SDMs) from crowdsourced data to compare the climate T. clavata experiences in its native range to its introduced range. We found evidence that the climate of T. clavatas native range differs significantly from its introduced range and that the most similar climate in North America to its native range is to the north of its current introduced range. We then compared the SDM predictions to current observations of spread. Consistent with predictions, T. clavata appears to be spreading faster to the north than to the south. Lastly, we conducted surveys to investigate potential ecological impacts of T. clavata on the diversity of native orb weaving spiders. Importantly, Trichonephila clavata was the most common and abundant species observed in the survey, and was numerically dominant at half of the sites it was present in. Our models also suggest that there is lower native orb weaver species richness and diversity closer to where T. clavata was initially found and where it has been established the longest, though human population density complicates this finding. This early study is the first to forecast how widely this spider may spread in its introduced range and explore potential ecological impacts of T. clavata, and we call for continued investigation of this invasions effects.</p>
