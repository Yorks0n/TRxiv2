A.; Espinoza, E.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561297\nThe Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.\nNew Interactive Machine Learning Tool for Marine Image Analysis\nAuthors: Clark, H. P.; Smith, A. G.; McKay Fletcher, D.; Larsson, A. I.; Jaspars, M.; De Clippele, L. H.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562046\nDue to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {+/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.\nCross-sector collaboration reduces SARS-CoV-2 risk in deer\nAuthors: Cook, J. D.; Rosenblatt, E.; DiRenzo, G. V.; Campbell Grant, E. H.; Mosher, B.; Arce, F.; Christensen, S.; Ghai, R.; Runge, M.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562192\nOne Health helps achieve optimal health outcomes for people, animals, plants, and their shared environments. We describe a multidisciplinary effort to better understand and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread in white-tailed deer across One Health sectors. We first framed the risk problem with three governance sectors that manage captive and wild deer and human public health. The framing included the objectives for each sector, interactions that facilitate human-to-deer and deer-to-deer transmission, and alternatives intended to reduce risk. We then developed a dynamic compartmental model that linked wild and captive deer herds and humans and simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. For baseline conditions, we estimated that median SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wild and captive herds varied between 0.03 - 0.07, incidence between 0.68 - 1.46, and probability of persistence between 0.64 - 0.97 across 120-day simulations. We then tested single-sector alternatives alone and in combination with other sector actions. We found that single sector alternatives varied in their ability to reduce transmission and that the best performing alternative required collaborative actions among wildlife management, agricultural management, and public health agencies.\nExtraordinary levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in vertebrate animals at a New Mexico desert oasis: multiple pathways for wildlife and human exposure\nAuthors: Witt, C.

T.; Williamson, J. L.; Cook, J. A.; Dunnum, J. L.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561778\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) threaten human and wildlife health, but their movement through food webs remains poorly understood. Contamination of the physical environment is widespread, but particularly concentrated at military installations. Here we measured 17 PFAS in wild, free-living mammals and migratory birds at Holloman Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico, USA, where wastewater catchment lakes form biodiverse oases. PFAS concentrations were among the highest ever reported in animal tissues, and high levels have persisted for at least three decades. The hazardous long carbon-chain form, perfluorooctanosulfonic acid (PFOS), was most abundant, with liver concentrations averaging tens of thousands of ng/g wet weight (ww), reaching as high 97,000 ng/g (ww) in a 1994 specimen of white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and 38,000 ng/g ww in a duck, the American wigeon (Mareca americana). Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) averaged thousands of ng/g ww in the livers of birds and house mice, but one order of magnitude lower in the livers of upland desert rodent species. PFAS levels were strikingly lower at control sites, even for highly mobile migratory species. Tissue concentrations were correlated within individuals, and consistently higher in liver than in muscle or blood. Twenty of 23 vertebrate species sampled at Holloman AFB were heavily contaminated, representing multiple trophic levels and microhabitats, and implicating a range of pathways for PFAS spread: ingestion of surface water, sediments, and dust; foraging on aquatic invertebrates and plants by secondary consumers; and preying upon small vertebrates by higher level consumers, including consumption of game species by hunters. Unlike in other aquatic systems, piscivory was not an important pathway of PFAS uptake. In sum, legacy PFAS at a desert wetland have permeated the local food web across a period of decades, severely contaminating resident and migrant animals, and likely exposing humans via game meat consumption and outdoor recreation. Five highlightsO_LIA biodiverse, wetland food web at a military base is heavily contaminated with PFAS. C_LIO_LILittoral-zone mice and aquatic birds had high liver PFOS, up to 97,000 ng/g ww.

A.; Gottdenker, N. L.; Meyers, L. A.; Becker, D. J.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562433\nAlthough the global conversion of wildlife habitat to built environments often has negative impacts on biodiversity, some wildlife have the ability to cope by living in human-made structures. However, the determinants of this adaptation on a global scale are not well understood and may signify species with unique conservation needs at the human-wildlife interface. Here, we identify the trait profile associated with anthropogenic roosting in bats globally and characterize the evolution of this phenotype using an original dataset of roosting behavior developed across 1,279 extant species. Trait-based analyses showed that anthropogenic roosting is predictable across bats and is associated with habitat generalism, small geographic ranges, small body size, temperate zone distributions, and insectivory. We identified moderate phylogenetic signal in this complex phenotype, which has undergone both gains and losses across bat evolution and for which speciation rates are lower compared to natural roosting bats.\nEvidence of spatial regime shifts: contrasting spatial dynamics of three Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the North Sea.\nAuthors: Cecapolli, E.; Romagnoni, G.; Bloecker, A.; Moellmann, C.; Sguotti, C.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562168\nRecent scientific assessments have started to consider the presence of multiple populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea due to genetic evidence. The Atlantic cod stock as a whole has experienced a regime shift in the North Sea and is now considered to be in a persistent depleted state. Here we investigated if the regime shift detected for North Sea cod manifested differently across areas (South, North-West and Viking (North-East)), revealing different dynamics and recovery potential for the corresponding populations. Methods from change point analyses to stochastic cusp models were applied to detect the regime shifts. We found that cod in the Southern North Sea has undergone a regime shift and is now in a persistent depleted state. The Viking population is in a low state but with high resilience, making its dynamics more predictable and thus easier to manage. Finally, the north-western population did not show signs of a regime shift and is in a high biomass level. Several abiotic and biotic drivers (e.g. fishing, warming) contribute to these differences. Our study provides useful information for the restructuring of management units of cod in the North Sea and highlights the importance of looking at regime shifts spatially.\nOn multiple infections by parasites with complex life cycles\nAuthors: Nguyen, P. L.; Gokhale, C. S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562184\nHost manipulation is a common strategy of parasites with complex lifecycles. It directly affects predator-prey dynamics in trophically transmitted parasites. Theoretical studies suggest that predation-enhancing manipulation often decimates the prey population, making parasites prone to extinction. Host manipulation, however, can also suppress predation due to conflicting interests when multiple parasites infect a host, often neglected in theoretical studies. Misaligned interests of coinfecting parasites can occur due to limited carrying capacity or parasitoid developmental stage. Including this realistic complexity in a mathematical model, the results depart from previous studies substantially. We show that coinfecting multi-trophic parasites can preserve the predator-prey system and themselves through a combination of manipulation and reproduction parameters. Our study highlights the necessity and provides the means of incorporating the reality of multiple parasites and their multi-trophic life cycles in the theory of parasite ecology.\nA hitchhiker's guide to Europe: mapping human-mediated dispersal of the invasive Japanese beetle\nAuthors: Borner, L.; Martinetti, D.; Poggi, S.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561184\nEarly detection of hitchhiking pests requires the identification of strategic entry points via transport. We propose a framework for achieving this in Europe using the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) as a case study. Human-mediated dispersal has been responsible for its introduction into several continents over the last century, including Europe where it is listed as a priority pest. Furthermore, interceptions far from the infested area confirm the risk of unintentional transport within continental Europe. Here, we analyse how three modes of transport - air, rail and road - connect the infested area to the rest of Europe. We ranked all European regions from most to least reachable from the infested area. We identified border regions and distant major cities that are readily reachable and observed differences between modes. We propose a composite reachability index combining the three modes, which provides a valuable tool for designing a continental surveillance strategy and prioritising highly reachable regions, as demonstrated by recent interceptions. Significance statementSpecies can be moved long distances by unintentional human transport. Such events can lead to their introduction into non-native areas where they can cause biological invasions. Using the case study of the Japanese beetle, a hitchhiker invasive insect, we propose a framework for identifying entry points for human-transported pests within Europe. We consider how the European infested area is connected to the rest of the continent by three modes of transport: air, rail and road. We propose a methodology that considers the three modes to identify potential entry points. This framework could assist authorities in designing surveillance strategies to achieve early detection of pests in Europe.\nAnophelesModel: An R package to interface mosquito bionomics, human exposure and intervention effects with models of malaria intervention impact\nAuthors: Golumbeanu, M.; Briët, O.; Champagne, C.; Lemant, J.; Winkel, M.; Zogo, B.; Gerhards, M.; Sinka, M.; Chitnis, N.; Penny, M.; Pothin, E.; Smith, T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562838\nIn recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access, R package that directly allows incorporating generated entomological data for adjustment of models to assess intervention scenarios according to species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 Anopheles species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and on estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.\nViromes vs. mixed community metagenomes: choice of method dictates interpretation of viral community ecology\nAuthors: Kosmopoulos, J. C.; Klier, K. M.; Langwig, M. V.; Tran, P. Q.; Anantharaman, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562385\nViruses, the majority of which are uncultivated, are among the most abundant biological entities in microbiomes and ecosystems on Earth. From selfishly altering community-wide microbial physiology to driving microbiome dynamics, viruses (particularly bacteriophage) are fundamental members of microbiomes. While the number of studies leveraging viral metagenomics (viromics) for studying uncultivated viruses is growing, standards for viromics research are lacking. Viromics can leverage computational discovery of viruses from total metagenomes of all community members (hereafter metagenomes) or use physical separation of virus-specific fractions (hereafter viromes). However, differences in the recovery and interpretation of viruses from metagenomes and viromes obtained from the same samples remains understudied. Here, we compare viral communities from paired viromes and metagenomes obtained from 51 diverse samples across human gut, soil, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Overall, viral communities obtained from viromes were more abundant and species rich than those obtained from metagenomes, although there were some exceptions. Despite this, metagenomes still contained many viral genomes not detected in viromes. We also found notable differences in the predicted lytic state of viruses detected in viromes vs. metagenomes at the time of sequencing. Other forms of variation observed include genome presence/absence, genome quality, and encoded protein content between viromes and metagenomes, but the magnitude of these differences varied by environment. Overall, our results here show that ones choice of method can lead to differing interpretations of viral community ecology. We suggest that the choice of whether to target a metagenome or virome should be dependent on the environmental context and ecological questions being asked. However, our overall recommendation to researchers investigating viral ecology and evolution is to pair both approaches to maximize their respective benefits.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to advances in imaging technologies, the rate of marine video and image data collection is drastically increasing. Often these datasets are not analysed to their full potential as extracting information for multiple species, such as their presence and surface area, is incredibly time-consuming. This study demonstrates the potential of a new open-source interactive machine learning tool, RootPainter, to analyse large marine image datasets quickly and accurately. The tool was initially developed to measure plant roots, but here was tested on its ability to measure the presence and surface area of the cold-water coral reef associate sponge species, Mycale lingua, in two types of underwater image data: 18,346 time-lapse images and 1,420 remotely operated vehicle video frames. New corrective annotation metrics integrated with RootPainter, such as dice score and species area error, allow for the objective assessment of when to stop model training and reduce the need for manual model validation. Three highly accurate Mycale lingua models were created using RootPainter, as indicated by their average dice score of 0.94 {&#43;/-} 0.06. Model transfer and optimisation aided in the production of two of these models, increasing analysis efficiency from 6 to 16 times faster than manual annotation in Photoshop, for underwater observatory images. Sponge and surface area measurements were extracted from both datasets allowing future investigation of sponge behaviours and distributions. This study demonstrates that interactive machine learning tools and model sharing have the potential to dramatically increase image analysis speeds, collaborative research, and our collective knowledge on spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One Health helps achieve optimal health outcomes for people, animals, plants, and their shared environments. We describe a multidisciplinary effort to better understand and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread in white-tailed deer across One Health sectors. We first framed the risk problem with three governance sectors that manage captive and wild deer and human public health. The framing included the objectives for each sector, interactions that facilitate human-to-deer and deer-to-deer transmission, and alternatives intended to reduce risk. We then developed a dynamic compartmental model that linked wild and captive deer herds and humans and simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. For baseline conditions, we estimated that median SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wild and captive herds varied between 0.03 - 0.07, incidence between 0.68 - 1.46, and probability of persistence between 0.64 - 0.97 across 120-day simulations. We then tested single-sector alternatives alone and in combination with other sector actions. We found that single sector alternatives varied in their ability to reduce transmission and that the best performing alternative required collaborative actions among wildlife management, agricultural management, and public health agencies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) threaten human and wildlife health, but their movement through food webs remains poorly understood. Contamination of the physical environment is widespread, but particularly concentrated at military installations. Here we measured 17 PFAS in wild, free-living mammals and migratory birds at Holloman Air Force Base (AFB), New Mexico, USA, where wastewater catchment lakes form biodiverse oases. PFAS concentrations were among the highest ever reported in animal tissues, and high levels have persisted for at least three decades. The hazardous long carbon-chain form, perfluorooctanosulfonic acid (PFOS), was most abundant, with liver concentrations averaging tens of thousands of ng/g wet weight (ww), reaching as high 97,000 ng/g (ww) in a 1994 specimen of white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and 38,000 ng/g ww in a duck, the American wigeon (Mareca americana). Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) averaged thousands of ng/g ww in the livers of birds and house mice, but one order of magnitude lower in the livers of upland desert rodent species. PFAS levels were strikingly lower at control sites, even for highly mobile migratory species. Tissue concentrations were correlated within individuals, and consistently higher in liver than in muscle or blood. Twenty of 23 vertebrate species sampled at Holloman AFB were heavily contaminated, representing multiple trophic levels and microhabitats, and implicating a range of pathways for PFAS spread: ingestion of surface water, sediments, and dust; foraging on aquatic invertebrates and plants by secondary consumers; and preying upon small vertebrates by higher level consumers, including consumption of game species by hunters. Unlike in other aquatic systems, piscivory was not an important pathway of PFAS uptake. In sum, legacy PFAS at a desert wetland have permeated the local food web across a period of decades, severely contaminating resident and migrant animals, and likely exposing humans via game meat consumption and outdoor recreation.

        <p class="abstract">Although the global conversion of wildlife habitat to built environments often has negative impacts on biodiversity, some wildlife have the ability to cope by living in human-made structures. However, the determinants of this adaptation on a global scale are not well understood and may signify species with unique conservation needs at the human-wildlife interface. Here, we identify the trait profile associated with anthropogenic roosting in bats globally and characterize the evolution of this phenotype using an original dataset of roosting behavior developed across 1,279 extant species. Trait-based analyses showed that anthropogenic roosting is predictable across bats and is associated with habitat generalism, small geographic ranges, small body size, temperate zone distributions, and insectivory. We identified moderate phylogenetic signal in this complex phenotype, which has undergone both gains and losses across bat evolution and for which speciation rates are lower compared to natural roosting bats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent scientific assessments have started to consider the presence of multiple populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea due to genetic evidence. The Atlantic cod stock as a whole has experienced a regime shift in the North Sea and is now considered to be in a persistent depleted state. Here we investigated if the regime shift detected for North Sea cod manifested differently across areas (South, North-West and Viking (North-East)), revealing different dynamics and recovery potential for the corresponding populations. Methods from change point analyses to stochastic cusp models were applied to detect the regime shifts. We found that cod in the Southern North Sea has undergone a regime shift and is now in a persistent depleted state. The Viking population is in a low state but with high resilience, making its dynamics more predictable and thus easier to manage. Finally, the north-western population did not show signs of a regime shift and is in a high biomass level. Several abiotic and biotic drivers (e.g. fishing, warming) contribute to these differences. Our study provides useful information for the restructuring of management units of cod in the North Sea and highlights the importance of looking at regime shifts spatially.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Host manipulation is a common strategy of parasites with complex lifecycles. It directly affects predator-prey dynamics in trophically transmitted parasites. Theoretical studies suggest that predation-enhancing manipulation often decimates the prey population, making parasites prone to extinction. Host manipulation, however, can also suppress predation due to conflicting interests when multiple parasites infect a host, often neglected in theoretical studies. Misaligned interests of coinfecting parasites can occur due to limited carrying capacity or parasitoid developmental stage. Including this realistic complexity in a mathematical model, the results depart from previous studies substantially. We show that coinfecting multi-trophic parasites can preserve the predator-prey system and themselves through a combination of manipulation and reproduction parameters. Our study highlights the necessity and provides the means of incorporating the reality of multiple parasites and their multi-trophic life cycles in the theory of parasite ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early detection of hitchhiking pests requires the identification of strategic entry points via transport. We propose a framework for achieving this in Europe using the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) as a case study. Human-mediated dispersal has been responsible for its introduction into several continents over the last century, including Europe where it is listed as a priority pest. Furthermore, interceptions far from the infested area confirm the risk of unintentional transport within continental Europe. Here, we analyse how three modes of transport - air, rail and road - connect the infested area to the rest of Europe. We ranked all European regions from most to least reachable from the infested area. We identified border regions and distant major cities that are readily reachable and observed differences between modes. We propose a composite reachability index combining the three modes, which provides a valuable tool for designing a continental surveillance strategy and prioritising highly reachable regions, as demonstrated by recent interceptions.

Significance statementSpecies can be moved long distances by unintentional human transport. Such events can lead to their introduction into non-native areas where they can cause biological invasions. Using the case study of the Japanese beetle, a hitchhiker invasive insect, we propose a framework for identifying entry points for human-transported pests within Europe. We consider how the European infested area is connected to the rest of the continent by three modes of transport: air, rail and road. We propose a methodology that considers the three modes to identify potential entry points. This framework could assist authorities in designing surveillance strategies to achieve early detection of pests in Europe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access, R package that directly allows incorporating generated entomological data for adjustment of models to assess intervention scenarios according to species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 Anopheles species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and on estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Viruses, the majority of which are uncultivated, are among the most abundant biological entities in microbiomes and ecosystems on Earth. From selfishly altering community-wide microbial physiology to driving microbiome dynamics, viruses (particularly bacteriophage) are fundamental members of microbiomes. While the number of studies leveraging viral metagenomics (viromics) for studying uncultivated viruses is growing, standards for viromics research are lacking. Viromics can leverage computational discovery of viruses from total metagenomes of all community members (hereafter metagenomes) or use physical separation of virus-specific fractions (hereafter viromes). However, differences in the recovery and interpretation of viruses from metagenomes and viromes obtained from the same samples remains understudied. Here, we compare viral communities from paired viromes and metagenomes obtained from 51 diverse samples across human gut, soil, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Overall, viral communities obtained from viromes were more abundant and species rich than those obtained from metagenomes, although there were some exceptions. Despite this, metagenomes still contained many viral genomes not detected in viromes. We also found notable differences in the predicted lytic state of viruses detected in viromes vs. metagenomes at the time of sequencing. Other forms of variation observed include genome presence/absence, genome quality, and encoded protein content between viromes and metagenomes, but the magnitude of these differences varied by environment. Overall, our results here show that ones choice of method can lead to differing interpretations of viral community ecology. We suggest that the choice of whether to target a metagenome or virome should be dependent on the environmental context and ecological questions being asked. However, our overall recommendation to researchers investigating viral ecology and evolution is to pair both approaches to maximize their respective benefits.</p>
