  "articleBody": " Evaluating key evidence and formulating regulatory alternatives regarding the UK Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill\nAuthors: Challender, D.; 't Sas-Rolfes, M.; Dickman, A.; Hare, D.; Hart, A.; Hoffmann, M.; Mallon, D.; Mandisodza-Chikerema, R.; Roe, D.\nScore: 119.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.13.544826\nPublic policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as \"trophy hunting\" is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {+/-} 66.53 (mean {+/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {+/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.\nRevisiting soil fungal biomarkers and conversion factors: Interspecific variability in phospholipid fatty acids, ergosterol and rDNA copy numbers\nAuthors: Camenzind, T.; Haslwimmer, H.; Rillig, M. C.; Ruess, L.; Finn, D. R.; Tebbe, C. C.; Hempel, S.; Marhan, S.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574151\nThe abundances of fungi and bacteria in soil are used as simple predictors for carbon dynamics, and represent widely available microbial traits. Soil biomarkers serve as quantitative estimates of these microbial groups, though not quantifying microbial biomass per se. The accurate conversion to microbial carbon pools, and an understanding of its comparability among soils is therefore needed. We refined conversion factors for classical fungal biomarkers, and evaluated the application of quantitative PCR (qPCR, rDNA copies) as a biomarker for soil fungi. Based on biomarker contents in pure fungal cultures of 30 isolates, combined with available references, we propose average conversion factors of 95.3 g fungal C g-1 ergosterol, 32.0 mg fungal C {micro}mol-1 PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and 0.264 pg fungal C ITS1 DNA copy-1. As expected, interspecific variability was most pronounced in rDNA copies, though qPCR results showed the least phylogenetic bias. A modeling approach based on exemplary agricultural soils further supported the hypothesis that high diversity in soil buffers against biomarker variability, whereas also phylogenetic biases impact the accuracy of comparisons in biomarker estimates. Our analyses suggest that qPCR results cover the fungal community in soil best, though with a variability only partly offset in highly diverse soils. PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and ergosterol represent accurate biomarkers to quantify Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To conclude, the ecological interpretation and coverage of biomarker data prior to their application in global models is important, where the combination of different biomarkers may be most insightful.\nThe effects of phenotypic plasticity on diversification rates and adaptive evolution in simulated environments with different climatic and cost contexts\nAuthors: Barbosa Junior, E. C.; Dodonov, P.; Japyassu, H.; Vilela, B.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573714\nPhenotypic plasticity can either hinder or facilitate genetic evolution, thus affecting macroevolution. However, the mechanisms and associations of phenotypic plasticity with biodiversity patterns remain unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phenotypic plasticity on adaptive evolution in the context of climatic changes and plasticity costs, specifically examining the rates of trait evolution, speciation, extinction, and diversification. We employed an eco-evolutionary agent-based model, incorporating body temperature as a plastic trait that dynamically responds to fluctuations in environmental temperature. We found the same pattern of results for both climate and plasticity cost contexts. We found that an increase in plasticity leads to a decrease in extinction and trait evolution rates, with high plasticity serving to postpone mass extinction events. Systems with plastic species experience higher speciation rates. Additionally, as plasticity increases in systems, diversification rates also increase. Our study supports the hypothesis that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. It provides new insights into the effect of plasticity on adaptive evolution at larger scales, considering relevant mechanisms and factors such as population size, grouping, occupancy, plasticity extension, and dispersion.\nWildCLIP: Scene and animal attribute retrieval from camera trap data with domain-adapted vision-language models\nAuthors: Gabeff, V.; Russwurm, M.; Tuia, D.; Mathis, A.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572990\nWildlife observation with camera traps has great potential for ethology and ecology, as it gathers data non-invasively in an automated way. However, camera traps produce large amounts of uncurated data, which is time-consuming to annotate. Existing methods to label these data automatically commonly use a fixed pre-defined set of distinctive classes and require many labeled examples per class to be trained. Moreover, the attributes of interest are sometimes rare and difficult to find in large data collections. Large pretrained vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), offer great promises to facilitate the annotation process of camera-trap data. Images can be described with greater detail, the set of classes is not fixed and can be extensible on demand and pretrained models can help to retrieve rare samples. In this work, we explore the potential of CLIP to retrieve images according to environmental and ecological attributes. We create WildCLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on wildlife camera-trap images and to further increase its flexibility, we add an adapter module to better expand to novel attributes in a few-shot manner. We quantify WildCLIPs performance and show that it can retrieve novel attributes in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our findings outline new opportunities to facilitate annotation processes with complex and multi-attribute captions. The code will be made available at https://github.com/amathislab/wildclip.\nHow much warming can mosquito vectors tolerate?\nAuthors: Couper, L.; Desire Uwera Nalukwago, D.; Lyberger, K.; Farner, J.; Mordecai, E. A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574109\nWhile climate warming is expected to substantially impact the global landscape of mosquito-borne disease, impacts will vary across disease systems and regions. Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins - the difference between an organisms upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 12 major mosquito species (including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae) that are the major vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that most mosquito vector species have large positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their range, when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. For species with distributions spanning both hemispheres, we find the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, just south of the equator, as well as at their northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability in the subtropics. Underlying these broad scale patterns, we find clear biogeographical differences in vector thermal safety with regions such as the Middle East, India, northwestern Africa, southeastern Australia, and the southwestern U.S., and desert and xeric shrubland biomes having the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.\nIndirect effects of habitat amount mediated by habitat configuration determine bat diversity at the landscape-scale in Peninsular Malaysia\nAuthors: Hazard, Q. C. K.; Yoh, N.; Moore, J.; Senawi, J.; Gibson, L.; Froidevaux, J. S. P.; Palmeirim, A. F.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573737\nThe impacts of fragmentation are often overlooked in landscape studies investigating how habitat loss impacts biodiversity, despite the casual relationship linking both processes. As habitat loss is the primary cause of fragmentation, understanding the inter-related effects of these twin processes on biodiversity is key to minimise biodiversity loss. Here we assess how habitat amount and configuration influence insectivorous bat assemblages, considering both the direct effects of these processes, as well as the indirect effects of habitat amount mediated through configuration. Bats were acoustically surveyed along independent gradients of habitat amount (forest cover) and configuration (number of patches and edge density) across 28 insular landscapes embedded within a Malaysian hydroelectric reservoir. Using Structural Equation Modelling, the direct and indirect effects of habitat amount were examined on bat sonotype richness, total, and guild-specific activity (forest, edge and open-space foragers). Forest cover had a direct and positive effect on sonotype richness and forest forager activity. The quadratic relationship linking edge density and forest cover was strong and overall positive, but while below 30% of forest cover, increasingly forested landscapes had increasingly high edge densities, the opposite pattern was observed in more forested landscapes. On the other hand, increasingly forested landscapes consistently harboured less patches. Owing to the overall low habitat amount in our landscapes and negative edge effects, the indirect effects of forest cover (mediated through edge density) were therefore negative on sonotype richness, outweighing any positive direct effect. The number of patches had little effect on the bat assemblage, except on total activity which was higher in landscapes harbouring more forest patches. As a result, negative indirect effects of forest cover mediated through number of patches were only observed on total activity. Our results highlight that, in natural settings, habitat amount can hardly be altered without influencing habitat configuration, thereby preventing any independent management of these threats. Minimising habitat loss is therefore essential to balance the associated prevailing negative effects of fragmentation on insectivorous bats across tropical forests.\nHormetic effect induced by Beauveria bassiana in Myzus persicae\nAuthors: Arinanto, L. S.; Hoffmann, A. A.; Ross, P. A.; Gu, X.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574279\nMyzus persicae, a serious sap-sucking pest of a large variety of host plants in agriculture, is traditionally controlled using chemical insecticides but there is interest in using biopesticides as restrictions are increasingly placed on the use of broad-spectrum pesticides. Here we show that in petri dish experiments high concentrations of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (strain PRRI 5336) lead to rapid mortality of M. persicae but at a low concentration (1 * 104 conidia mL-1) there is a hormetic effect where longevity and fecundity are enhanced. Hormetic effects persisted across a generation with reduced development times and increased fecundity in the offspring of M. persicae exposed to B. bassiana. Whole plant experiments point to a hormetic effect being detected in two out of three tested lines. The impact of these effects might also depend on whether M. persicae was transinfected with the endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis, which decreases fecundity and survival compared to aphids lacking this endosymbiont. This fecundity cost was ameliorated in the generation following exposure to the entomopathogen. While B. bassiana is effective in controlling M. persicae especially at higher spore concentrations, utilization of this entomopathogen requires careful consideration of hormetic effects at lower spore concentrations, and further research to optimize its application for sustainable agriculture is recommended.\nEcological niche contributes to the persistence of the Western x Glaucous-winged Gull hybrid zone\nAuthors: Geng, X.; Summers, J.; Chen, N.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571742\nHybrid zones occur in nature when populations with limited reproductive barriers overlap in space. Many hybrid zones persist over time, and different models have been proposed to explain how selection can maintain hybrid zone stability. More empirical studies are needed to elucidate the role of ecological adaptation in maintaining stable hybrid zones. Here, we investigated the role of exogenous factors in maintaining a hybrid zone between western gulls (Larus occidentalis) and glaucous-winged gulls (L. glaucescens). We used ecological niche models (ENMs) and niche similarity tests to quantify and examine the ecological niches of western gulls, glaucous-winged gulls, and their hybrids. We found evidence of niche divergence between all three groups. Our results best support the bounded superiority model, providing further evidence that exogenous selection favoring hybrids may be an important factor in maintaining this stable hybrid zone.\nInsect hosts are nutritional landscapes navigated by fungal pathogens\nAuthors: De Fine Licht, H. H.; Csontos, Z.; Nielsen, P. J. D. N.; Langkilde, E. B.; Kjaergaard Hansen, A. K.; Shik, J. Z.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574030\nNutrition can mediate host-pathogen interactions indirectly when specific deficiencies (e.g. iron or glutamine) constrain host immune performance. Nutrition can also directly govern these interactions since invading pathogens colonize finite landscapes of nutritionally variable host tissues that must be optimally foraged during pathogen development. We first used a conceptual framework of nutritional niches to show that insect-pathogenic Metarhizium fungi navigate host landscapes where different tissues vary widely in (protein (P) and carbohydrates (C)). We next tested whether host-specific Metarhizium species have narrower fundamental nutritional niches (FNN) than host-generalists by measuring pathogen performance across an in vitro nutritional landscape simulating a within-host foraging environment. We then tested how developing pathogens navigate nutritional landscapes by developing a liquid-media approach to track pathogen intake of P and C over time. Host-specificity did not govern FNN dimensions as three tested Metarhizium species: 1) grew maximally across C treatments assuming P was present above a lower threshold, and 2) similarly initiated dispersal behaviors and sporulated when either C or P became depleted. However, specialist and generalist pathogens navigated nutritional landscapes differently. The host specialist (M. acridum) first prioritized C intake, but generalists (M. anisopliae, M. robertsii) prioritized P and C according to their availability. Numbers of known hosts may be insufficient to delimit pathogens as specialists or generalists since diverse hosts do not necessarily comprise diverse nutritional landscapes. Instead, immune responses of hosts and nutritional niche breadth of pathogens are likely co-equal evolutionary drivers of host specificity.\nReduced palatability, fast flight, and tails: Decoding the defence arsenal of Eudaminae skipper butterflies in a Neotropical locality\nAuthors: Linke, D.; Hernandez Mejia, J.; Eche Navarro, V. N. P.; Salinas Sanchez, L.; de Gusmao Ribeiro, P.; Elias, M.; Matos-Maravi, P.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572531\nO_LIPrey often relies on multiple defences to avoid predators, such as difficulty of capture, attack deflection, or unpleasant taste. Eudaminae skipper butterflies rely on behavioural (fast flight) and mechanical defences (hindwing tails), but other defences like unpalatability (consumption deterrence), and the interaction among defences, have not been assessed. C_LIO_LIWe test the palatability of 12 abundant Eudaminae species from a Neotropical locality, using training and feeding experiments with domestic chicks. Further, we approximate the difficulty of capture explained by flight speed and quantified by wing loading. To test how multiple defences are associated and explained by body size and habitat preference, we perform phylogenetic Bayesian regression analyses. C_LIO_LIWe found a broad range of palatability in Eudaminae, within and among species. Palatability was negatively correlated with wing loading, indicating that butterflies with higher flight speed tend to have lower palatability. C_LIO_LIThe presence or absence of tails did not explain the level of butterfly palatability, showing that attack deflection and consumption deterrence are not mutually exclusive defences. Habitat preference (open or forested environments) did not explain the level of palatability in Eudaminae, but it seems that butterflies with high wing loading (fast flight) tended to occupy semi-closed (e.g., hilltops) or closed habitats (e.g., secondary forest). C_LIO_LIFinally, the level of unpalatability in Eudaminae is size dependent, larger butterflies are less palatable, perhaps due to their more likely detectability/preference by predators. Altogether, our findings shed light on the contexts favouring the prevalence of single vs. multiple defensive strategies in prey. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Public policy addressing biodiversity loss is most likely to be effective when it is informed by appropriate evidence and considers potential unintended consequences. We evaluate key evidence relating to the UKs Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill. We characterize the UKs role in international hunting trophy trade by analyzing CITES trade data for 2000-2021 and 2015-2021. For CITES-listed species imported to/exported from the UK as hunting trophies in these periods we use data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species to determine whether hunting designated as &#34;trophy hunting&#34; is i) likely a major threat contributing to species being of elevated conservation concern, ii) likely or possibly causing localized declines, or iii) not a threat. We then use the Red List to determine whether legal hunting for trophies provides, or has potential to provide, benefits for species and/or people where it takes place. Finally, we evaluate the UK Governments impact assessment of the bill. In 2000-2021 an estimated 3494 hunting trophies from 73 CITES-listed species and subspecies were exported to the UK involving an estimated 2549 whole organism equivalents (WOEs), i.e., individual animals. Imports involved 158.86 {&#43;/-} 66.53 (mean {&#43;/-} SD) trophies/year (115.83 {&#43;/-} 32.27 WOEs/year). In 2015-2021, 79% of imports were from countries where populations of the hunted species were stable, increasing, or abundant. Legal hunting for trophies is not a major threat to any of the 73 species or subspecies imported to the UK, but it likely or possibly represents a local threat to 9 species. Conversely, this hunting does, or has potential to, benefit 20 species and subspecies. Among other concerns, the impact assessment fails to adequately consider the costs and benefits to local communities in countries where legal hunting for trophies occurs. Informed by these analyses we discuss more proportionate regulatory options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The abundances of fungi and bacteria in soil are used as simple predictors for carbon dynamics, and represent widely available microbial traits. Soil biomarkers serve as quantitative estimates of these microbial groups, though not quantifying microbial biomass per se. The accurate conversion to microbial carbon pools, and an understanding of its comparability among soils is therefore needed. We refined conversion factors for classical fungal biomarkers, and evaluated the application of quantitative PCR (qPCR, rDNA copies) as a biomarker for soil fungi. Based on biomarker contents in pure fungal cultures of 30 isolates, combined with available references, we propose average conversion factors of 95.3 g fungal C g-1 ergosterol, 32.0 mg fungal C {micro}mol-1 PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and 0.264 pg fungal C ITS1 DNA copy-1. As expected, interspecific variability was most pronounced in rDNA copies, though qPCR results showed the least phylogenetic bias. A modeling approach based on exemplary agricultural soils further supported the hypothesis that high diversity in soil buffers against biomarker variability, whereas also phylogenetic biases impact the accuracy of comparisons in biomarker estimates. Our analyses suggest that qPCR results cover the fungal community in soil best, though with a variability only partly offset in highly diverse soils. PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and ergosterol represent accurate biomarkers to quantify Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To conclude, the ecological interpretation and coverage of biomarker data prior to their application in global models is important, where the combination of different biomarkers may be most insightful.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phenotypic plasticity can either hinder or facilitate genetic evolution, thus affecting macroevolution. However, the mechanisms and associations of phenotypic plasticity with biodiversity patterns remain unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phenotypic plasticity on adaptive evolution in the context of climatic changes and plasticity costs, specifically examining the rates of trait evolution, speciation, extinction, and diversification. We employed an eco-evolutionary agent-based model, incorporating body temperature as a plastic trait that dynamically responds to fluctuations in environmental temperature. We found the same pattern of results for both climate and plasticity cost contexts. We found that an increase in plasticity leads to a decrease in extinction and trait evolution rates, with high plasticity serving to postpone mass extinction events. Systems with plastic species experience higher speciation rates. Additionally, as plasticity increases in systems, diversification rates also increase. Our study supports the hypothesis that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. It provides new insights into the effect of plasticity on adaptive evolution at larger scales, considering relevant mechanisms and factors such as population size, grouping, occupancy, plasticity extension, and dispersion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wildlife observation with camera traps has great potential for ethology and ecology, as it gathers data non-invasively in an automated way. However, camera traps produce large amounts of uncurated data, which is time-consuming to annotate. Existing methods to label these data automatically commonly use a fixed pre-defined set of distinctive classes and require many labeled examples per class to be trained. Moreover, the attributes of interest are sometimes rare and difficult to find in large data collections. Large pretrained vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), offer great promises to facilitate the annotation process of camera-trap data. Images can be described with greater detail, the set of classes is not fixed and can be extensible on demand and pretrained models can help to retrieve rare samples. In this work, we explore the potential of CLIP to retrieve images according to environmental and ecological attributes. We create WildCLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on wildlife camera-trap images and to further increase its flexibility, we add an adapter module to better expand to novel attributes in a few-shot manner. We quantify WildCLIPs performance and show that it can retrieve novel attributes in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our findings outline new opportunities to facilitate annotation processes with complex and multi-attribute captions. The code will be made available at https://github.com/amathislab/wildclip.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While climate warming is expected to substantially impact the global landscape of mosquito-borne disease, impacts will vary across disease systems and regions. Understanding which diseases, and where within their distributions, these impacts are most likely to occur is critical for preparing public health interventions. While research has centered on potential warming-driven expansions in vector transmission, less is known about the potential for vectors to experience warming-driven stress or even local extirpations. In conservation biology, species risk from climate warming is often quantified through vulnerability indices such as thermal safety margins - the difference between an organisms upper thermal limit and its habitat temperature. Here, we estimated thermal safety margins for 12 major mosquito species (including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae) that are the major vectors of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile and other major arboviruses, across their known ranges to investigate which mosquitoes and regions are most and least vulnerable to climate warming. We find that most mosquito vector species have large positive thermal safety margins across the majority of their range, when realistic assumptions of mosquito behavioral thermoregulation are incorporated. For species with distributions spanning both hemispheres, we find the lowest climate vulnerability, in terms of both the magnitude and duration of thermal safety, just south of the equator, as well as at their northern temperate range edges, and the highest climate vulnerability in the subtropics. Underlying these broad scale patterns, we find clear biogeographical differences in vector thermal safety with regions such as the Middle East, India, northwestern Africa, southeastern Australia, and the southwestern U.S., and desert and xeric shrubland biomes having the highest climate vulnerability across vector species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The impacts of fragmentation are often overlooked in landscape studies investigating how habitat loss impacts biodiversity, despite the casual relationship linking both processes. As habitat loss is the primary cause of fragmentation, understanding the inter-related effects of these twin processes on biodiversity is key to minimise biodiversity loss. Here we assess how habitat amount and configuration influence insectivorous bat assemblages, considering both the direct effects of these processes, as well as the indirect effects of habitat amount mediated through configuration. Bats were acoustically surveyed along independent gradients of habitat amount (forest cover) and configuration (number of patches and edge density) across 28 insular landscapes embedded within a Malaysian hydroelectric reservoir. Using Structural Equation Modelling, the direct and indirect effects of habitat amount were examined on bat sonotype richness, total, and guild-specific activity (forest, edge and open-space foragers). Forest cover had a direct and positive effect on sonotype richness and forest forager activity. The quadratic relationship linking edge density and forest cover was strong and overall positive, but while below 30% of forest cover, increasingly forested landscapes had increasingly high edge densities, the opposite pattern was observed in more forested landscapes. On the other hand, increasingly forested landscapes consistently harboured less patches. Owing to the overall low habitat amount in our landscapes and negative edge effects, the indirect effects of forest cover (mediated through edge density) were therefore negative on sonotype richness, outweighing any positive direct effect. The number of patches had little effect on the bat assemblage, except on total activity which was higher in landscapes harbouring more forest patches. As a result, negative indirect effects of forest cover mediated through number of patches were only observed on total activity. Our results highlight that, in natural settings, habitat amount can hardly be altered without influencing habitat configuration, thereby preventing any independent management of these threats. Minimising habitat loss is therefore essential to balance the associated prevailing negative effects of fragmentation on insectivorous bats across tropical forests.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myzus persicae, a serious sap-sucking pest of a large variety of host plants in agriculture, is traditionally controlled using chemical insecticides but there is interest in using biopesticides as restrictions are increasingly placed on the use of broad-spectrum pesticides. Here we show that in petri dish experiments high concentrations of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (strain PRRI 5336) lead to rapid mortality of M. persicae but at a low concentration (1 * 104 conidia mL-1) there is a hormetic effect where longevity and fecundity are enhanced. Hormetic effects persisted across a generation with reduced development times and increased fecundity in the offspring of M. persicae exposed to B. bassiana. Whole plant experiments point to a hormetic effect being detected in two out of three tested lines. The impact of these effects might also depend on whether M. persicae was transinfected with the endosymbiont Rickettsiella viridis, which decreases fecundity and survival compared to aphids lacking this endosymbiont. This fecundity cost was ameliorated in the generation following exposure to the entomopathogen. While B. bassiana is effective in controlling M. persicae especially at higher spore concentrations, utilization of this entomopathogen requires careful consideration of hormetic effects at lower spore concentrations, and further research to optimize its application for sustainable agriculture is recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hybrid zones occur in nature when populations with limited reproductive barriers overlap in space. Many hybrid zones persist over time, and different models have been proposed to explain how selection can maintain hybrid zone stability. More empirical studies are needed to elucidate the role of ecological adaptation in maintaining stable hybrid zones. Here, we investigated the role of exogenous factors in maintaining a hybrid zone between western gulls (Larus occidentalis) and glaucous-winged gulls (L. glaucescens). We used ecological niche models (ENMs) and niche similarity tests to quantify and examine the ecological niches of western gulls, glaucous-winged gulls, and their hybrids. We found evidence of niche divergence between all three groups. Our results best support the bounded superiority model, providing further evidence that exogenous selection favoring hybrids may be an important factor in maintaining this stable hybrid zone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nutrition can mediate host-pathogen interactions indirectly when specific deficiencies (e.g. iron or glutamine) constrain host immune performance. Nutrition can also directly govern these interactions since invading pathogens colonize finite landscapes of nutritionally variable host tissues that must be optimally foraged during pathogen development. We first used a conceptual framework of nutritional niches to show that insect-pathogenic Metarhizium fungi navigate host landscapes where different tissues vary widely in (protein (P) and carbohydrates (C)). We next tested whether host-specific Metarhizium species have narrower fundamental nutritional niches (FNN) than host-generalists by measuring pathogen performance across an in vitro nutritional landscape simulating a within-host foraging environment. We then tested how developing pathogens navigate nutritional landscapes by developing a liquid-media approach to track pathogen intake of P and C over time. Host-specificity did not govern FNN dimensions as three tested Metarhizium species: 1) grew maximally across C treatments assuming P was present above a lower threshold, and 2) similarly initiated dispersal behaviors and sporulated when either C or P became depleted. However, specialist and generalist pathogens navigated nutritional landscapes differently. The host specialist (M. acridum) first prioritized C intake, but generalists (M. anisopliae, M. robertsii) prioritized P and C according to their availability. Numbers of known hosts may be insufficient to delimit pathogens as specialists or generalists since diverse hosts do not necessarily comprise diverse nutritional landscapes. Instead, immune responses of hosts and nutritional niche breadth of pathogens are likely co-equal evolutionary drivers of host specificity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIPrey often relies on multiple defences to avoid predators, such as difficulty of capture, attack deflection, or unpleasant taste. Eudaminae skipper butterflies rely on behavioural (fast flight) and mechanical defences (hindwing tails), but other defences like unpalatability (consumption deterrence), and the interaction among defences, have not been assessed.
C_LIO_LIWe test the palatability of 12 abundant Eudaminae species from a Neotropical locality, using training and feeding experiments with domestic chicks. Further, we approximate the difficulty of capture explained by flight speed and quantified by wing loading. To test how multiple defences are associated and explained by body size and habitat preference, we perform phylogenetic Bayesian regression analyses.
C_LIO_LIWe found a broad range of palatability in Eudaminae, within and among species. Palatability was negatively correlated with wing loading, indicating that butterflies with higher flight speed tend to have lower palatability.
C_LIO_LIThe presence or absence of tails did not explain the level of butterfly palatability, showing that attack deflection and consumption deterrence are not mutually exclusive defences. Habitat preference (open or forested environments) did not explain the level of palatability in Eudaminae, but it seems that butterflies with high wing loading (fast flight) tended to occupy semi-closed (e.g., hilltops) or closed habitats (e.g., secondary forest).
C_LIO_LIFinally, the level of unpalatability in Eudaminae is size dependent, larger butterflies are less palatable, perhaps due to their more likely detectability/preference by predators. Altogether, our findings shed light on the contexts favouring the prevalence of single vs. multiple defensive strategies in prey.
