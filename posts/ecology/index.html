Conventional surveys for this, however, are generally time- and labour-demanding and invasive. To overcome these challenges, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has emerged as a promising spawning survey method. This study aimed to identify the spawning season, times, and locations of Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) through eDNA analysis and to investigate the utility of eDNA analysis in spawning surveys. We expected that eDNA concentration and nuclear/mitochondrial DNA ratio should change overnight due to sperm-derived eDNA as this species is a nocturnal spawner. The eDNA concentrations at sunset and sunrise at three sites in Maizuru Bay were compared on a monthly for one year. Our results showed significant increases in eDNA concentrations and ratios at all sites in July, suggesting potential spawning occurrences. At the site with a particularly large increase in concentration, temporal monitoring showed a diurnal eDNA peak (21:00-24:00), likely reflecting the jack mackerel spawning time window. Subsequently, our eDNA-based estimations were supported by the successful capture of their eggs using a plankton net. This is the first report providing evidence of saltwater fish spawning using eDNA analysis, underscoring the usefulness of this approach for spawning detection.\nMultifunctional evolution of palm squirrel coat colour and pattern\nAuthors: Nivetha, M.; D'Souza, S.; Shijisha, A.; Ligon, R. A.; Nandini, R.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557893\nComplex colour pattern traits often evolve in response to multiple selective pressures, emphasizing the need for their investigation in an integrative framework. We use museum specimens (n=718) to study the evolution of coat colouration in three palm squirrel species (Funambulus spp.) in the Indian subcontinent, with climate, vegetation, and predators as the potential selective forces. Our results indicate a strong geographical trend in coat colour distribution within and across species, with darker individuals in the southern and lighter individuals in the northern regions. We find significant darkening of coat colouration in more humid, densely vegetated regions with dark soils. Fine-scale intra-specific analyses suggest that species respond differently to multiple abiotic selective pressures. Investigation of stripe pattern elements suggests that the colour-based elements are more visible to raptors, while luminance-based elements are more visible to ferrets. We also find that squirrel species are darker in areas with denser and taller canopies, with low-contrast stripes specific to each predators vision. Overall, squirrel coat colouration evolves in response to multiple abiotic factors, including climate and habitat, and specific stripe elements provide particular visual effects on predators depending on the habitat.\nThe Atlantic Forest of South America: spatiotemporal dynamics of remaining vegetation and implications for conservation\nAuthors: Vancine, M. H.; Muylaert, R. L.; Niebuhr, B. B.; Oshima, J. E. d. F.; Tonetti, V.; Bernardo, R.; De Angelo, C.; Rosa, M. R.; Grohmann, C. H.; Ribeiro, M. C.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558076\nThe Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (\u003e500,000 ha) by severely breaking them apart and amplifying fragmentation metrics. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%), with a connectivity increment. Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (\u003c50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is \u003c90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250-830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (\u003e10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future. HighlightsO_LIThere is 23% forest and 40% natural vegetation cover remaining in the Atlantic Forest. C_LIO_LIBetween 1986-2020, native forest cover decreased by 2.4% and natural vegetation by 3.6%.

L.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557841\nRapid evolution in colonizing populations can alter our ability to predict future range expansions. Recent studies suggest that how evolution influences the predictability of range expansion speed depends on the balance of genetic drift and selection at the range front, with factors increasing selection proposed to produce greater consistency, and hence increased predictability, in range expansion speed. Here, we test whether selection from environmental gradients across space produces more predictable range expansion speeds, using the experimental evolution of replicate, duckweed populations colonizing landscapes with and without a temperature gradient. While range expansion across a temperature gradient was slower, with range-front populations displaying higher population densities and genetic signatures consistent with greater selection, we found that range expansion speed was more variable and less predictable across replicate populations. Our results therefore challenge current theory, highlighting that selection and spatial priority effects could together govern the predictability of range expansion speeds.\nDisentangling non-random structure from random placement when estimating β-diversity through space or time\nAuthors: McGlinn, D.; Blowes, S. A.; Dornelas, M.; Engel, T.; Martins, I. S.; Shimadzu, H.; Gotelli, N. J.; Magurran, A.; McGill, B.; Chase, J. M.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558467\nThere is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.\nAutomatic vocalisation detection delivers reliable, multi-faceted, and global avian biodiversity monitoring\nAuthors: Sethi, S.

F.; Rosten, C.; Somveille, M.; Tuanmu, M.-N.; Banks-Leite, C.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557670\nTracking biodiversity and its dynamics at scale is essential if we are to solve global environmental challenges. Detecting animal vocalisations in passively recorded audio data offers a highly automatable, inexpensive, and taxonomically broad way to monitor biodiversity. However, uptake is slow due to the expertise and labour required to label new data and fine-tune algorithms for each deployment. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf bird vocalisation detection model, BirdNET, to 152,376 hours of audio comprising of datasets from Norway, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and Brazil. We manually listened to a subset of detections for each species in each dataset and found precisions of over 80% for 89 of the 139 species (100% for 57 species). Whilst some species were reliably detected across multiple datasets, the performance of others was dataset specific. By filtering out unreliable detections, we could extract species and community level insight on diel (Brazil) and seasonal (Taiwan) temporal scales, as well as landscape (Costa Rica) and national (Norway) spatial scales. Our findings demonstrate that, with a relatively fast validation step, a single vocalisation detection model can deliver multi-faceted community and species level insight across highly diverse datasets; unlocking the scale at which acoustic monitoring can deliver immediate applied impact.\nBoosting biodiversity monitoring using smartphone-driven, rapidly accumulating citizen data\nAuthors: Atsumi, K.; Nishida, Y.; Ushio, M.; Nishi, H.; Genroku, T.; Fujiki, S.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557657\nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework increased the demand for biodiversity distribution data. To gather species observation from the public, we introduced a mobile application called Biome in Japan. By employing species identification algorithms and gamification elements, Biome has gathered \u003e5M observations since its launch in 2019. However, cloud-sourced data often exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) enable infer species distribution while accommodating such bias. We investigated Biome datas quality and how incorporating Biome data influences the performance of SDMs. Species identification accuracy of Biome data exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. The distributions of 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan were modeled, and their accuracy was improved by incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data. For endangered species, traditional survey data required \u003e2,000 records to build accurate models (Boyce index [\u0026ge;] 0.9), though only ca.300 records were required when Biome was blended. The unique data distributions may explain this improvement: Biome data covers urban-natural gradients uniformly, while traditional data is biased towards natural areas. Combining multiple data sources offers insights into species distributions across Japan, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment.\nPatterns and drivers of pollen co-transport networks vary across pollinator groups\nAuthors: Carneiro, L. T.; Williams, J. N.; Barker, D. A.; Anderson, J. W.; Martel, C.; Arceo-Gomez, G.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558666\nPollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.\nLarval thermosensitivity shapes adult population dynamics in Anopheles mosquitoes\nAuthors: Estupinan, J.; Weyrich, A. M.; Schloesser, P.; Naujoks, C.; Gildenhard, M.; Diarra, A.; Diallo, M.; Sangare, D.; Telschow, A.; Hsieh, C.-h.; Levashina, E. A.; Carrillo-Bustamante, P.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558414\nMosquitoes are vectors of human life-threatening pathogens, posing a significant global health threat. While the influence of temperature on mosquito life-history traits has been extensively studied in laboratory settings, the ecological factors shaping mosquito development and population dynamics in natural environments remain poorly understood. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating field data from Mali, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling, to investigate the causal relationships between climate variables and the abundance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Using convergent-cross mapping analyses an adult abundance in the Nanguilabou village, we observed that the dynamics of adult mosquito populations was driven by larval thermosensitivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experimental studies that revealed a density-dependent larval thermal response. Through mathematical modeling, we quantified the complex interplay between temperature and larval density, demonstrating that temperature and density have independent, non-synergistic effects on larval developmental speed, mortality, and pupation rates. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how larval development shapes adult mosquito populations, highlighting the significance of multidisciplinary approaches in studying climate-driven mosquito population dynamics.\nTowards interpretable learned representations for Ecoacoustics using variational auto-encoding\nAuthors: Gibb, K. A.; Eldridge, A.; Sandom, C. J.; Simpson, I. J. A.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556690\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm -a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) -to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardwares frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding spawning ecology is vital for species/population management and conservation. Conventional surveys for this, however, are generally time- and labour-demanding and invasive. To overcome these challenges, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has emerged as a promising spawning survey method. This study aimed to identify the spawning season, times, and locations of Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) through eDNA analysis and to investigate the utility of eDNA analysis in spawning surveys. We expected that eDNA concentration and nuclear/mitochondrial DNA ratio should change overnight due to sperm-derived eDNA as this species is a nocturnal spawner. The eDNA concentrations at sunset and sunrise at three sites in Maizuru Bay were compared on a monthly for one year. Our results showed significant increases in eDNA concentrations and ratios at all sites in July, suggesting potential spawning occurrences. At the site with a particularly large increase in concentration, temporal monitoring showed a diurnal eDNA peak (21:00-24:00), likely reflecting the jack mackerel spawning time window. Subsequently, our eDNA-based estimations were supported by the successful capture of their eggs using a plankton net. This is the first report providing evidence of saltwater fish spawning using eDNA analysis, underscoring the usefulness of this approach for spawning detection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Complex colour pattern traits often evolve in response to multiple selective pressures, emphasizing the need for their investigation in an integrative framework. We use museum specimens (n=718) to study the evolution of coat colouration in three palm squirrel species (Funambulus spp.) in the Indian subcontinent, with climate, vegetation, and predators as the potential selective forces. Our results indicate a strong geographical trend in coat colour distribution within and across species, with darker individuals in the southern and lighter individuals in the northern regions. We find significant darkening of coat colouration in more humid, densely vegetated regions with dark soils. Fine-scale intra-specific analyses suggest that species respond differently to multiple abiotic selective pressures. Investigation of stripe pattern elements suggests that the colour-based elements are more visible to raptors, while luminance-based elements are more visible to ferrets. We also find that squirrel species are darker in areas with denser and taller canopies, with low-contrast stripes specific to each predators vision. Overall, squirrel coat colouration evolves in response to multiple abiotic factors, including climate and habitat, and specific stripe elements provide particular visual effects on predators depending on the habitat.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (&gt;500,000 ha) by severely breaking them apart and amplifying fragmentation metrics. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%), with a connectivity increment. Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (&lt;50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is &lt;90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250-830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (&gt;10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future.

        <p class="abstract">Rapid evolution in colonizing populations can alter our ability to predict future range expansions. Recent studies suggest that how evolution influences the predictability of range expansion speed depends on the balance of genetic drift and selection at the range front, with factors increasing selection proposed to produce greater consistency, and hence increased predictability, in range expansion speed. Here, we test whether selection from environmental gradients across space produces more predictable range expansion speeds, using the experimental evolution of replicate, duckweed populations colonizing landscapes with and without a temperature gradient. While range expansion across a temperature gradient was slower, with range-front populations displaying higher population densities and genetic signatures consistent with greater selection, we found that range expansion speed was more variable and less predictable across replicate populations. Our results therefore challenge current theory, highlighting that selection and spatial priority effects could together govern the predictability of range expansion speeds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tracking biodiversity and its dynamics at scale is essential if we are to solve global environmental challenges. Detecting animal vocalisations in passively recorded audio data offers a highly automatable, inexpensive, and taxonomically broad way to monitor biodiversity. However, uptake is slow due to the expertise and labour required to label new data and fine-tune algorithms for each deployment. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf bird vocalisation detection model, BirdNET, to 152,376 hours of audio comprising of datasets from Norway, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and Brazil. We manually listened to a subset of detections for each species in each dataset and found precisions of over 80% for 89 of the 139 species (100% for 57 species). Whilst some species were reliably detected across multiple datasets, the performance of others was dataset specific. By filtering out unreliable detections, we could extract species and community level insight on diel (Brazil) and seasonal (Taiwan) temporal scales, as well as landscape (Costa Rica) and national (Norway) spatial scales. Our findings demonstrate that, with a relatively fast validation step, a single vocalisation detection model can deliver multi-faceted community and species level insight across highly diverse datasets; unlocking the scale at which acoustic monitoring can deliver immediate applied impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework increased the demand for biodiversity distribution data. To gather species observation from the public, we introduced a mobile application called  Biome in Japan. By employing species identification algorithms and gamification elements, Biome has gathered &gt;5M observations since its launch in 2019. However, cloud-sourced data often exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) enable infer species distribution while accommodating such bias. We investigated Biome datas quality and how incorporating Biome data influences the performance of SDMs. Species identification accuracy of Biome data exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. The distributions of 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan were modeled, and their accuracy was improved by incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data. For endangered species, traditional survey data required &gt;2,000 records to build accurate models (Boyce index [&amp;ge;] 0.9), though only ca.300 records were required when Biome was blended. The unique data distributions may explain this improvement: Biome data covers urban-natural gradients uniformly, while traditional data is biased towards natural areas. Combining multiple data sources offers insights into species distributions across Japan, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes are vectors of human life-threatening pathogens, posing a significant global health threat. While the influence of temperature on mosquito life-history traits has been extensively studied in laboratory settings, the ecological factors shaping mosquito development and population dynamics in natural environments remain poorly understood. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating field data from Mali, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling, to investigate the causal relationships between climate variables and the abundance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Using convergent-cross mapping analyses an adult abundance in the Nanguilabou village, we observed that the dynamics of adult mosquito populations was driven by larval thermosensitivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experimental studies that revealed a density-dependent larval thermal response. Through mathematical modeling, we quantified the complex interplay between temperature and larval density, demonstrating that temperature and density have independent, non-synergistic effects on larval developmental speed, mortality, and pupation rates. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how larval development shapes adult mosquito populations, highlighting the significance of multidisciplinary approaches in studying climate-driven mosquito population dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm -a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) -to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardwares frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.</p>
