S.\nScore: 36.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547152\nSpecies occurrence data are foundational for research, conservation, and science communication, but the limited availability and accessibility of reliable data represents a major obstacle, particularly for insects, which face mounting pressures. We present BeeBDC, a new R package, and a global bee occurrence dataset to address this issue. We combined \u003e18.3 million bee occurrence records from multiple public repositories (GBIF, SCAN, iDigBio, USGS, ALA) and smaller datasets, then standardised, flagged, deduplicated, and cleaned the data using the reproducible BeeBDC R-workflow. Specifically, we harmonised species names (following established global taxonomy), country names, and collection dates and we added record-level flags for a series of potential quality issues. These data are provided in two formats, \"cleaned\" and \"flagged-but-uncleaned\". The BeeBDC package with online documentation provides end users the ability to modify filtering parameters to address their research questions. By publishing reproducible R workflows and globally cleaned datasets, we can increase the accessibility and reliability of downstream analyses. This workflow can be implemented for other taxa to support research and conservation.\nEnvironment-organism feedbacks drive changes in ecological interactions\nAuthors: Meacock, O. J.; Mitri, S.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.565024\nEcological interactions, the impact of one organism on the growth and death of another, underpin our understanding of the long-term composition and the functional properties of communities. Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.\nConspicuous shell shape plasticity across lake-stream habitats in a freshwater mussel (Pyganodon grandis)\nAuthors: Keogh, S. M.; Minerich, B. J.; Ohlman, L. M.; Pletta, M. E.; Scheunemann, A. E.; Schroeder, Z. K.; Secrist, Z. A.; Franzen, A. J.; Sietman, B. E.; Simons, A. M.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564758\n2.Hydrodynamic forces and their absence appears to exert differential selection pressure between lake and stream populations, creating a tight fit between organismal phenotypes and their environments. Ecophenotypic variants may be the result from isolated genetic evolution or phenotypic plasticity, where a widespread genotype can produce multiple phenotypes dependent on the environment. Freshwater mussels possess a wide degree of morphological variation that frequently covaries with the environment, making them a good system to understand the mechanisms of ecophenotypic variation across hydrological conditions. We designed a two-year experiment where individuals from the same Pyganodon grandis maternal brood (half-full siblings) were reared at a controlled site and four natural sites involving one lake and three streams. At the end of the experiment, shell shape was quantified for recaptured (N=70), wild (N=206), and zoo-reared (N=305) mussels. Analysis of covariance found significant differences in shell shape between rearing sites, particularly between stream and lake habitats, but no shape differences were detected across the three stream sites. At two of the four sites, shell shape of recaptured individuals matched the morphology of wild populations. Genomic sequencing and parentage analysis identified 27 different fathers among recaptured individuals. Yet, no genetic differences were present between stream and lake habitats and there was no effect of parentage on shell shape. Taken together, phenotypic plasticity, over genetic differentiation, is identified as the primary mechanism of shell shape ecophenotypy. Plasticity may be a key adaptation for freshwater mussels and possibly provide a buffer against their imperilment in degraded habitats. 1. Summary statementStreamlined and obese freshwater mussel shell shapes in stream-lake environments are developed from the same maternal brood and may reflect adaptations to the presence and absence of streamflow.\nNuclear eDNA Metabarcoding Primers for Anthozoan Coral Biodiversity Assessment\nAuthors: McCartin, L. J.; Saso, E.; Vohsen, S. A.; Pittoors, N. C.; Demetriades, P.; McFadden, C. S.; Quattrini, A. M.; Herrera, S.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564240\nThe distributions of anthozoan corals are under-characterized due to their wide bathymetric range, occurrences in remote locales, and difficulties of identification from morphology alone. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing promises to be a non-invasive strategy to complement conventional approaches for mapping and monitoring coral communities. Primers for eDNA meta-barcoding have been designed to amplify nuclear and mitochondrial DNA barcodes in shallow scleractinians and mitochondrial MutS in deep-sea octocorals. However, a comprehensive method for eDNA meta-barcoding from all anthozoan corals, including black corals, has not been developed. We leveraged a sequence database of global coral collections, from shallow water to the deep sea, to design new PCR primers for coral eDNA sequencing that target the 28S rRNA gene. We tested the performance of these primers by amplifying and sequencing eDNA from water samples collected in the Gulf of Mexico near mesophotic and deep-sea corals that were also imaged, sampled, and sequenced. Sequencing libraries produced using the primers were highly enriched in coral eDNA, with up to 99.8% of the reads originating from corals. Further, the 28S barcode amplified using the primers distinguished coral genera. We recovered amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) identical to DNA barcodes derived from Sanger sequencing and genome skimming of corals sampled at the same field sites. This new eDNA meta-barcoding strategy permits targeted eDNA sequencing of black corals, octocorals, and scleractinians at sites where they co-occur and expands our current toolkit for mapping and monitoring coral communities in shallow coral reefs and the deep sea.\nSurvivability and Life Support in Sealed Mini-Ecosystems with Simulated Planetary Soils\nAuthors: Sato, T.; Abe, K.; Koseki, J.; Seto, M.; Yokoyama, J.; Akashi, T.; Terada, M.; Kadowaki, K.; Yoshida, S.; Yamashiki, Y. A.; Shimamura, T.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565408\nEstablishing a sustainable life-support system for space exploration is challenging due to the vast distances, costs, and differing environments from Earth. Using insights from the Biosphere 2 experiment, we introduced the \"Ecosphere\" and \"Biosealed\" systems in custom containers to replicate Earth's ecosystems, suggesting feasible space migration through transplanting Earth-like biomes. Over four years, we gained deeper insights into these enclosed ecosystems. Moisture deficiency was a major obstacle to plant growth, which we addressed by incorporating a groundwater layer in the containers. We underscored the critical role of microorganisms in building and sustaining these ecosystems. However, temperature spikes from sunlight threatened stability. Our experiments confirmed fruit flies' survival on plant-produced oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria. Interactions between plants, microbes, and simulated space soils were examined. Detailed analysis unveiled diverse microbes shaping both confined and simulated space environments. Major findings include the symbiotic relationship of plants with cyanobacteria, the potential of LED lighting in sun-limited missions, and challenges with ethylene gas and moisture. Microbial integration in rough soils holds promise for seed germination, but understanding their role in space soils is crucial. Our research offers a comprehensive foundation for future space life-support systems and underlines potential concerns about microbes affecting human health.\nTerrestrial land cover shapes fish diversity in major subtropical rivers\nAuthors: Zhang, H.; Blackman, R. C.; Furrer, R.; Osathanunkul, M.; Brantschen, J.; Di Muri, C.; Harper, L. R.; Haenfling, B.; Niklaus, P. A.; Pellissier, L.; Schaepman, M. E.; Zong, S.; Altermatt, F.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564688\nFreshwater biodiversity is critically affected by human modifications of terrestrial land use and land cover (LULC)1,2. Yet, knowledge of the spatial extent and magnitude of LULC-aquatic biodiversity linkages is still surprisingly limited, impeding the implementation of optimal management strategies3. Here, we compiled fish diversity data across a 160,000-km2 subtropical river catchment in Thailand characterized by exceptional biodiversity4 yet intense anthropogenic alterations5, and attributed fish species richness and community composition to contemporary terrestrial LULC across the catchment. We estimated a spatial range of LULC effects extending up to about 20 km upstream from sampling sites, and explained nearly 60 % of the variance in the observed species richness, associated with major LULC categories including croplands, forest, and urban areas. We find that integrating both spatial range and magnitudes of LULC effects is needed to accurately predict fish species richness. Further, projected LULC changes showcase future gains and losses of fish species richness across the river network and offer a scalable basis for riverine biodiversity conservation and land management, allowing for potential mitigation of biodiversity loss in highly diverse yet data-deficient tropical to sub-tropical riverine habitats.\nGlobal abundance patterns, diversity, and ecology of Patescibacteria in wastewater treatment plants\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Hu, H.; Kristensen, J. M.; Pjevac, P.; Kitzinger, K.; Herbold, C. W.; Hausmann, B.; Dueholm, M. K. D.; Nielsen, P. H.\nScore: 59.8, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.562895\nBackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning. ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter. ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.\nGains in soil C storage under anthropogenic N deposition are rapidly lost following its cessation\nAuthors: Propson, B. E.; Zak, D. R.; Classen, A. T.; Burton, A. J.; Freedman, Z. B.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.562515\nAnthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition enhanced the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink and partially offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This was driven by the suppression of microbial activity associated with the breakdown of soil organic matter. However, since the implementation of emission abatement policies in the 1970s, atmospheric N deposition has declined globally, and the consequences of this decline are unknown. Here, we assessed the response of soil C storage, and associated microbial activities, in a long-term field study that experimentally increased N deposition for 24-years. We measured soil C and N, parameters of microbial activity, and compared effect sizes of soil C in response to, and in recovery from, the N deposition treatment across the history of our experiment (1994-2022). Our results demonstrate that the accumulated C in the organic horizon has been lost and exhibit additional deficits 5-years post-termination of the N deposition treatment. These findings, in part, arise from mechanistic changes in microbial activity. Soil C in the mineral soil was less responsive thus far in recovery. If these organic horizon C dynamics are similar in other temperate forests, the Northern Hemisphere C sink will be reduced and climate warming will be enhanced.\nAge-related spatial ecology of Audouin's gull during the non-breeding season\nAuthors: Ponti, R.; Morera-Pujol, V.; Sallent, A.; Gonzalez-Solis, J.; Ramos, R.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563411\nRelationships between individuals age and the movement ecology and habitat preference of long-lived migratory birds still remain understudied. According to the exploration-refinement hypothesis it is thought that adults would select better and more productive areas for foraging than inexperienced juvenile birds would do. Additionally, age-related differences in migratory patterns and exploited habitats could be explained by the attempt to avoid competition between juveniles and adults. Here, we explored the differences in the migratory patterns, habitat selection and foraging behaviour between juvenile and adult Audouins gulls (Ichthyaetus audouinii), a species listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. We captured 9 juveniles and 8 adults in the colony of San Pedro (SE Spain) and equipped them with high-resolution 5-min programmed GPS to track their postnuptial/first migration and non-breeding destinations. First, juveniles tended to migrate longer distances than adults did. Second, the time spent foraging between age groups did not differ. Third, freshwater masses constituted an essential habitat during the non-breeding season for both juveniles and adults. Fourth, we found that adults used a greater variety of habitats than juveniles did, but adults positively select foraging habitats despite the low availability while juveniles do not. Finally, repeatability in habitat use of individuals of the same age was rather low. We provided evidence of age-related differences in migratory patterns and habitat exploitation during the non-breeding period in a migratory seabird which can be explained by the avoidance of competition between adults and juveniles and the greater experience in foraging performance that adults have in comparison with juveniles.\nUnveiling Urban Complexity: Integrating OpenStreetMap to enhance representation of fine-scale landscape heterogeneity\nAuthors: Gelmi-Candusso, T. A.; Rodriguez, P.; Fortin, M.-J.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564785\nLandscape heterogeneity has an impact on wildlife behavior, their interactions, and their persistence. Urban landscapes are among the worlds most heterogeneous landscapes, yet current global landcover maps classify developed land in a single landcover type. This limits the spatial scale at which urban ecologists can approach research questions. OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open-source mapping platform, can be leveraged to enhance the representation of landscape heterogeneity in developed areas. For this, we extracted OSM features with attributes representing infrastructure, land use and green cover, integrating these into a continental landcover map through a globally applicable computational framework. We validated our OSM-enhanced landcover layer against existing remote sensing, aerial photography, and local governmental maps for 33 cities in North America. Our frameworks output provides an 89% accurate representation of landscape heterogeneity. We discuss caveats, potential improvements, and ecological applications. Our OSM-based landcover enhancement framework will facilitate the use of open-source landscape information for improved ecological modeling and urban planning.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Species occurrence data are foundational for research, conservation, and science communication, but the limited availability and accessibility of reliable data represents a major obstacle, particularly for insects, which face mounting pressures. We present BeeBDC, a new R package, and a global bee occurrence dataset to address this issue. We combined &gt;18.3 million bee occurrence records from multiple public repositories (GBIF, SCAN, iDigBio, USGS, ALA) and smaller datasets, then standardised, flagged, deduplicated, and cleaned the data using the reproducible BeeBDC R-workflow. Specifically, we harmonised species names (following established global taxonomy), country names, and collection dates and we added record-level flags for a series of potential quality issues. These data are provided in two formats, &#34;cleaned&#34; and &#34;flagged-but-uncleaned&#34;. The BeeBDC package with online documentation provides end users the ability to modify filtering parameters to address their research questions. By publishing reproducible R workflows and globally cleaned datasets, we can increase the accessibility and reliability of downstream analyses. This workflow can be implemented for other taxa to support research and conservation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecological interactions, the impact of one organism on the growth and death of another, underpin our understanding of the long-term composition and the functional properties of communities. Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the  instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.</p>

        <p class="abstract">2.Hydrodynamic forces and their absence appears to exert differential selection pressure between lake and stream populations, creating a tight fit between organismal phenotypes and their environments. Ecophenotypic variants may be the result from isolated genetic evolution or phenotypic plasticity, where a widespread genotype can produce multiple phenotypes dependent on the environment. Freshwater mussels possess a wide degree of morphological variation that frequently covaries with the environment, making them a good system to understand the mechanisms of ecophenotypic variation across hydrological conditions. We designed a two-year experiment where individuals from the same Pyganodon grandis maternal brood (half-full siblings) were reared at a controlled site and four natural sites involving one lake and three streams. At the end of the experiment, shell shape was quantified for recaptured (N=70), wild (N=206), and zoo-reared (N=305) mussels. Analysis of covariance found significant differences in shell shape between rearing sites, particularly between stream and lake habitats, but no shape differences were detected across the three stream sites. At two of the four sites, shell shape of recaptured individuals matched the morphology of wild populations. Genomic sequencing and parentage analysis identified 27 different fathers among recaptured individuals. Yet, no genetic differences were present between stream and lake habitats and there was no effect of parentage on shell shape. Taken together, phenotypic plasticity, over genetic differentiation, is identified as the primary mechanism of shell shape ecophenotypy. Plasticity may be a key adaptation for freshwater mussels and possibly provide a buffer against their imperilment in degraded habitats.

1. Summary statementStreamlined and obese freshwater mussel shell shapes in stream-lake environments are developed from the same maternal brood and may reflect adaptations to the presence and absence of streamflow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The distributions of anthozoan corals are under-characterized due to their wide bathymetric range, occurrences in remote locales, and difficulties of identification from morphology alone. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing promises to be a non-invasive strategy to complement conventional approaches for mapping and monitoring coral communities. Primers for eDNA meta-barcoding have been designed to amplify nuclear and mitochondrial DNA barcodes in shallow scleractinians and mitochondrial MutS in deep-sea octocorals. However, a comprehensive method for eDNA meta-barcoding from all anthozoan corals, including black corals, has not been developed. We leveraged a sequence database of global coral collections, from shallow water to the deep sea, to design new PCR primers for coral eDNA sequencing that target the 28S rRNA gene. We tested the performance of these primers by amplifying and sequencing eDNA from water samples collected in the Gulf of Mexico near mesophotic and deep-sea corals that were also imaged, sampled, and sequenced. Sequencing libraries produced using the primers were highly enriched in coral eDNA, with up to 99.8% of the reads originating from corals. Further, the 28S barcode amplified using the primers distinguished coral genera. We recovered amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) identical to DNA barcodes derived from Sanger sequencing and genome skimming of corals sampled at the same field sites. This new eDNA meta-barcoding strategy permits targeted eDNA sequencing of black corals, octocorals, and scleractinians at sites where they co-occur and expands our current toolkit for mapping and monitoring coral communities in shallow coral reefs and the deep sea.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Establishing a sustainable life-support system for space exploration is challenging due to the vast distances, costs, and differing environments from Earth. Using insights from the Biosphere 2 experiment, we introduced the &#34;Ecosphere&#34; and &#34;Biosealed&#34; systems in custom containers to replicate Earth&#39;s ecosystems, suggesting feasible space migration through transplanting Earth-like biomes. Over four years, we gained deeper insights into these enclosed ecosystems. Moisture deficiency was a major obstacle to plant growth, which we addressed by incorporating a groundwater layer in the containers. We underscored the critical role of microorganisms in building and sustaining these ecosystems. However, temperature spikes from sunlight threatened stability. Our experiments confirmed fruit flies&#39; survival on plant-produced oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria. Interactions between plants, microbes, and simulated space soils were examined. Detailed analysis unveiled diverse microbes shaping both confined and simulated space environments. Major findings include the symbiotic relationship of plants with cyanobacteria, the potential of LED lighting in sun-limited missions, and challenges with ethylene gas and moisture. Microbial integration in rough soils holds promise for seed germination, but understanding their role in space soils is crucial. Our research offers a comprehensive foundation for future space life-support systems and underlines potential concerns about microbes affecting human health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Freshwater biodiversity is critically affected by human modifications of terrestrial land use and land cover (LULC)1,2. Yet, knowledge of the spatial extent and magnitude of LULC-aquatic biodiversity linkages is still surprisingly limited, impeding the implementation of optimal management strategies3. Here, we compiled fish diversity data across a 160,000-km2 subtropical river catchment in Thailand characterized by exceptional biodiversity4 yet intense anthropogenic alterations5, and attributed fish species richness and community composition to contemporary terrestrial LULC across the catchment. We estimated a spatial range of LULC effects extending up to about 20 km upstream from sampling sites, and explained nearly 60 % of the variance in the observed species richness, associated with major LULC categories including croplands, forest, and urban areas. We find that integrating both spatial range and magnitudes of LULC effects is needed to accurately predict fish species richness. Further, projected LULC changes showcase future gains and losses of fish species richness across the river network and offer a scalable basis for riverine biodiversity conservation and land management, allowing for potential mitigation of biodiversity loss in highly diverse yet data-deficient tropical to sub-tropical riverine habitats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning.

ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter.

ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition enhanced the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink and partially offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This was driven by the suppression of microbial activity associated with the breakdown of soil organic matter. However, since the implementation of emission abatement policies in the 1970s, atmospheric N deposition has declined globally, and the consequences of this decline are unknown. Here, we assessed the response of soil C storage, and associated microbial activities, in a long-term field study that experimentally increased N deposition for 24-years. We measured soil C and N, parameters of microbial activity, and compared effect sizes of soil C in response to, and in recovery from, the N deposition treatment across the history of our experiment (1994-2022). Our results demonstrate that the accumulated C in the organic horizon has been lost and exhibit additional deficits 5-years post-termination of the N deposition treatment. These findings, in part, arise from mechanistic changes in microbial activity. Soil C in the mineral soil was less responsive thus far in recovery. If these organic horizon C dynamics are similar in other temperate forests, the Northern Hemisphere C sink will be reduced and climate warming will be enhanced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Relationships between individuals age and the movement ecology and habitat preference of long-lived migratory birds still remain understudied. According to the exploration-refinement hypothesis it is thought that adults would select better and more productive areas for foraging than inexperienced juvenile birds would do. Additionally, age-related differences in migratory patterns and exploited habitats could be explained by the attempt to avoid competition between juveniles and adults. Here, we explored the differences in the migratory patterns, habitat selection and foraging behaviour between juvenile and adult Audouins gulls (Ichthyaetus audouinii), a species listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. We captured 9 juveniles and 8 adults in the colony of San Pedro (SE Spain) and equipped them with high-resolution 5-min programmed GPS to track their postnuptial/first migration and non-breeding destinations. First, juveniles tended to migrate longer distances than adults did. Second, the time spent foraging between age groups did not differ. Third, freshwater masses constituted an essential habitat during the non-breeding season for both juveniles and adults. Fourth, we found that adults used a greater variety of habitats than juveniles did, but adults positively select foraging habitats despite the low availability while juveniles do not. Finally, repeatability in habitat use of individuals of the same age was rather low. We provided evidence of age-related differences in migratory patterns and habitat exploitation during the non-breeding period in a migratory seabird which can be explained by the avoidance of competition between adults and juveniles and the greater experience in foraging performance that adults have in comparison with juveniles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Landscape heterogeneity has an impact on wildlife behavior, their interactions, and their persistence. Urban landscapes are among the worlds most heterogeneous landscapes, yet current global landcover maps classify developed land in a single landcover type. This limits the spatial scale at which urban ecologists can approach research questions. OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open-source mapping platform, can be leveraged to enhance the representation of landscape heterogeneity in developed areas. For this, we extracted OSM features with attributes representing infrastructure, land use and green cover, integrating these into a continental landcover map through a globally applicable computational framework. We validated our OSM-enhanced landcover layer against existing remote sensing, aerial photography, and local governmental maps for 33 cities in North America. Our frameworks output provides an 89% accurate representation of landscape heterogeneity. We discuss caveats, potential improvements, and ecological applications. Our OSM-based landcover enhancement framework will facilitate the use of open-source landscape information for improved ecological modeling and urban planning.</p>
