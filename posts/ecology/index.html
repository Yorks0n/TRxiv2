M.\nScore: 128.4, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.560707\nHuman decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered. O_QD\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" --George Orwell, Animal Farm (1945) C_QD\nThe evolutionary age-range size relationship is modulated by insularity and dispersal in plants and animals\nAuthors: Alzate, A.; Rozzi, R.; Velasco, J. A.; Robertson, D. R.; Zizka, A.; Tobias, J. A.; Hill, A.; Bacon, C. D.; Janzen, T.; Pellissier, L.; van der Plas, F.; Rosindell, J.; Onstein, R. E.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566377\nEarth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species' range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston \u0026 Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.\nEnvironment-organism feedbacks drive changes in ecological interactions\nAuthors: Meacock, O. J.; Mitri, S.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.565024\nEcological interactions, the impact of one organism on the growth and death of another, underpin our understanding of the long-term composition and the functional properties of communities. Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.\nUnveiling the Hidden Viromes Across the Animal Tree of Life: Insights from a Taxonomic Classification Pipeline Applied to Invertebrates of 31 Metazoan Phyla\nAuthors: Alfonso, P.; Butkovic, A.; Fernandez, R.; Riesgo, A.; Elena, S. F.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565523\nInvertebrates constitute the majority of animal species on Earth, including most disease-causing agents or vectors, with more diverse viromes when compared to vertebrates. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (i) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the Animal Tree of Life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (ii) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus interaction networks, and (iii) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising Retroviridae, Flaviviridae and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes. ImportanceThis study significantly enhances our understanding of the global animal virome by characterizing the viromes of previously unexamined invertebrate lineages from a large number of animal phyla. It showcases the great diversity of viromes within each phylum and investigates the role of habitat shaping animal viral communities. Furthermore, our research identifies dominant virus families in invertebrates and distinguishes phyla with analogous viromes. This study sets the road towards a deeper understanding of the virome across the Animal Tree of Life.\nEvaluating diversionary feeding as a method to resolve conservation conflicts in a recovering ecosystem\nAuthors: Bamber, J.; Kortland, K.; Sutherland, C.; Payo-Payo, A.; Lambin, X.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566200\nThe recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.\nCovert RNA viruses in medflies differ in their mode of transmission and tissue tropism\nAuthors: Hernandez-Pelegrin, L.; Huditz, H. I.; Castillo, P. G.; de Ruijter, N. C. A.; van Oers, M. M.; Herrero, S.; Ros, V. I. D.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566245\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the presence of covert viral infections in insects. These infections can be transmitted in insect populations via two main routes: vertical from parents to offspring, or horizontal between nonrelated individuals. Thirteen covert RNA viruses have been described in the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). Some of these viruses are established in different laboratory-reared and wild medfly populations, although variations in the viral repertoire and viral levels have been observed at different time points. To better understand these viral dynamics, we characterized the prevalence and levels of covert RNA viruses in two medfly strains, assessed the route of transmission of these viruses, and explored their distribution in medfly adult tissues. Altogether, our results indicated that the different RNA viruses found in medflies vary in their preferred route of transmission. Two iflaviruses and a narnavirus are predominantly transmitted through vertical transmission via the female, while a nodavirus and a nora virus exhibited a preference for horizontal transmission. Overall, our results give valuable insights into the viral tropism and transmission of RNA viruses in the medfly, contributing to the understanding of viral dynamics in insect populations.\nGlobal abundance patterns, diversity, and ecology of Patescibacteria in wastewater treatment plants\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Hu, H.; Kristensen, J. M.; Pjevac, P.; Kitzinger, K.; Herbold, C. W.; Hausmann, B.; Dueholm, M. K. D.; Nielsen, P. H.\nScore: 66.6, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.562895\nBackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning. ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter. ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.\nIndividual tree crown maps for the National Ecological Observatory Network\nAuthors: Weinstein, B.; Marconi, S.; Zare, A.; Bohlman, S.; Singh, A.; Graves, S.

P.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563626\nThe ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales allows an unprecedented view of forest ecosystems, forest restoration and responses to disturbance. To create detailed maps of tree species, airborne remote sensing can cover areas containing millions of trees at high spatial resolution. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual tree species using ground truthed data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees for 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network. Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1km^2 shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of six species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species. All predictions were uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. These data can be used to study forest macro-ecology, functional ecology, and responses to anthropogenic change.\nBacterial Diversity and Chemical Ecology of Natural Product-Producing Bacteria from Great Salt Lake Sediment\nAuthors: Bring Horvath, E. R.; Brazelton, W. J.; Kim, M. C.; Cullum, R.; Mulvey, M. A.; Fenical, W.; Winter, J. M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.565188\nGreat Salt Lake (GSL), located northwest of Salt Lake City, UT, is the largest terminal lake in the United States. While the average salinity of seawater is [~]3.3%, the salinity in GSL ranges between 5-28%. In addition to being a hypersaline environment, GSL also contains toxic concentrations of heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, and lead. The extreme environment of GSL makes it an intriguing subject of study, both for its unique microbiome and its potential to harbor novel natural product-producing bacteria, which could be used as resources for the discovery of biologically active compounds. Though work has been done to survey and catalogue bacteria found in GSL, the Lakes microbiome is largely unexplored, and little-to-no work has been done to characterize the natural product potential of GSL microbes. Here, we investigate the bacterial diversity of two important regions within GSL, describe the first genomic characterization of Actinomycetota isolated from GSL sediment, including the identification of a new Saccharomonospora species, and provide the first survey of the natural product potential of GSL bacteria.\nThe majority of Germany's small agricultural streams are in poor ecological status\nAuthors: von Goenner, J.; Groening, J.; Grescho, V.; Neuer, L.; Haensch, V. G.; Laue, B.; Molsberger-Lange, E.; Wilharm, E.; Liess, M.; Bonn, A.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564349\nAgricultural pesticides, nutrients, and habitat degradation are major causes of insect declines in lowland streams. To effectively conserve and restore stream habitats, standardized stream monitoring data and societal support for freshwater protection are needed. Here, we sampled 137 small stream sites across Germany, 83% of which were located in agricultural catchments, with more than 900 citizen scientists in 96 monitoring groups. Sampling was carried out according to Water Framework Directive standards as part of the citizen science freshwater monitoring program FLOW in spring and summer 2021, 2022 and 2023. The biological indicator SPEARpesticides was used to assess pesticide exposure and effects based on benthic invertebrate community composition. Overall, 58% of the monitored agricultural stream sites did not achieve a good ecological status in terms of macroinvertebrate community composition and indicated high pesticide exposure (SPEARpesticides status class: 29% moderate, 19% poor, 11% bad). The indicated pesticide pressure in streams was related to the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment area (R2=0.23, p\u003c0.001). With regards to hydromorphology, monitoring results revealed that 65% of the agricultural stream sites failed to reach a good status. The data base produced by citizen science groups was characterized by a high degree of accuracy. This was quantified by a comparative survey of SPEARpesticides index (R2=0.79, p\u003c0.001) and hydromorphology index values (R2=0.72, p\u003c0.001) by citizen scientists and professionals. Such citizen-driven monitoring of the status of watercourses could play a crucial role in monitoring and implementing the objective of the European Water Framework Directive, thus contributing to restoring and protecting freshwater ecosystems.

        <p class="abstract">Human decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have-nots&#34;, with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

        <p class="abstract">Earth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species&#39; range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston &amp; Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecological interactions, the impact of one organism on the growth and death of another, underpin our understanding of the long-term composition and the functional properties of communities. Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the  instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invertebrates constitute the majority of animal species on Earth, including most disease-causing agents or vectors, with more diverse viromes when compared to vertebrates. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (i) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the Animal Tree of Life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (ii) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus interaction networks, and (iii) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising Retroviridae, Flaviviridae and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes.

ImportanceThis study significantly enhances our understanding of the global animal virome by characterizing the viromes of previously unexamined invertebrate lineages from a large number of animal phyla. It showcases the great diversity of viromes within each phylum and investigates the role of habitat shaping animal viral communities. Furthermore, our research identifies dominant virus families in invertebrates and distinguishes phyla with analogous viromes. This study sets the road towards a deeper understanding of the virome across the Animal Tree of Life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of covert viral infections in insects. These infections can be transmitted in insect populations via two main routes: vertical from parents to offspring, or horizontal between nonrelated individuals. Thirteen covert RNA viruses have been described in the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). Some of these viruses are established in different laboratory-reared and wild medfly populations, although variations in the viral repertoire and viral levels have been observed at different time points. To better understand these viral dynamics, we characterized the prevalence and levels of covert RNA viruses in two medfly strains, assessed the route of transmission of these viruses, and explored their distribution in medfly adult tissues. Altogether, our results indicated that the different RNA viruses found in medflies vary in their preferred route of transmission. Two iflaviruses and a narnavirus are predominantly transmitted through vertical transmission via the female, while a nodavirus and a nora virus exhibited a preference for horizontal transmission. Overall, our results give valuable insights into the viral tropism and transmission of RNA viruses in the medfly, contributing to the understanding of viral dynamics in insect populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning.

ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter.

ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales allows an unprecedented view of forest ecosystems, forest restoration and responses to disturbance. To create detailed maps of tree species, airborne remote sensing can cover areas containing millions of trees at high spatial resolution. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual tree species using ground truthed data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees for 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network. Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1km^2 shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of six species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species. All predictions were uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. These data can be used to study forest macro-ecology, functional ecology, and responses to anthropogenic change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Great Salt Lake (GSL), located northwest of Salt Lake City, UT, is the largest terminal lake in the United States. While the average salinity of seawater is [~]3.3%, the salinity in GSL ranges between 5-28%. In addition to being a hypersaline environment, GSL also contains toxic concentrations of heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, and lead. The extreme environment of GSL makes it an intriguing subject of study, both for its unique microbiome and its potential to harbor novel natural product-producing bacteria, which could be used as resources for the discovery of biologically active compounds. Though work has been done to survey and catalogue bacteria found in GSL, the Lakes microbiome is largely unexplored, and little-to-no work has been done to characterize the natural product potential of GSL microbes. Here, we investigate the bacterial diversity of two important regions within GSL, describe the first genomic characterization of Actinomycetota isolated from GSL sediment, including the identification of a new Saccharomonospora species, and provide the first survey of the natural product potential of GSL bacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Agricultural pesticides, nutrients, and habitat degradation are major causes of insect declines in lowland streams. To effectively conserve and restore stream habitats, standardized stream monitoring data and societal support for freshwater protection are needed. Here, we sampled 137 small stream sites across Germany, 83% of which were located in agricultural catchments, with more than 900 citizen scientists in 96 monitoring groups. Sampling was carried out according to Water Framework Directive standards as part of the citizen science freshwater monitoring program FLOW in spring and summer 2021, 2022 and 2023. The biological indicator SPEARpesticides was used to assess pesticide exposure and effects based on benthic invertebrate community composition. Overall, 58% of the monitored agricultural stream sites did not achieve a good ecological status in terms of macroinvertebrate community composition and indicated high pesticide exposure (SPEARpesticides status class: 29%  moderate, 19%  poor, 11%  bad). The indicated pesticide pressure in streams was related to the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment area (R2=0.23, p&lt;0.001). With regards to hydromorphology, monitoring results revealed that 65% of the agricultural stream sites failed to reach a good status. The data base produced by citizen science groups was characterized by a high degree of accuracy. This was quantified by a comparative survey of SPEARpesticides index (R2=0.79, p&lt;0.001) and hydromorphology index values (R2=0.72, p&lt;0.001) by citizen scientists and professionals. Such citizen-driven monitoring of the status of watercourses could play a crucial role in monitoring and implementing the objective of the European Water Framework Directive, thus contributing to restoring and protecting freshwater ecosystems.
