However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for \u003e2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that slow and fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.\nEcological Impacts of Poultry Waste on Urban Raptors: Conflicts, Diseases, and Climate Change Implications amidst Pandemic Threats\nAuthors: Kumar, N.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.546415\nO_LIThe dramatic increase in poultry production and consumption (PPC) over the past decades has raised questions about its impacts on biodiversity, particularly in the Global South. This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asias largest livestock wet market, located next to the continents largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012. C_LIO_LIDaily processing of \u003e100,000 poultry-fowls at Ghazipur results in an annual production of [~]27,375 metric tonnes of poultry-waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately \u003e33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter-remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. Absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. This raises vital questions about microclimate impacts by green house gases (GHG) released from massive amounts of routine detritus. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste. C_LIO_LIPublic health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic-lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains. C_LIO_LIWaste-biomass driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food-waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats. C_LI Lay SummaryO_LIThe global trend of increasing consumption of broiler chickens, driven by rising incomes in tropical cities, has significant ecological implications for both native and migratory birds, as well as other commensal species. C_LIO_LIThe resulting large amounts of debris produced by poultry production and consumption have created a \"chicken reconfigured biosphere\" in cities along migratory paths. C_LIO_LITo better understand the local and global impacts of poultry production and consumption chains, I conducted a long-term study at Asias largest livestock wet market in Ghazipur, Delhi. C_LIO_LIThe findings reveal that informal handling of poultry waste and cultural practices have had significant impacts on animals that scavenge on the slaughter remains, particularly during the bird flu and COVID-19 pandemics. C_LIO_LIThe study recommends ways to minimise conflicts and health risks and reduce the potential impacts of rotting garbage on the climate by accommodating animals that have adapted to shared urban environments.

M.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547400\nUnderstanding how biotic interactions affect ecosystem functioning has been a research priority in natural sciences due to their critical role in bolstering ecological resilience1-3. Yet, traditional assessment of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species effective interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g. pollination4 or seed dispersal5), overlooking the synergistic effect of multiple functions that further underpin species-function and function-function interactions in multifunctional ecosystems. At the same time, while ecological network theory holds a potential to quantify the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality6, 7, its connection has been done mainly conceptually, due to challenges measuring different interactions and establishing their relevance across multiple niche dimensions8, 9. Such lack of quantitative studies therefore limits our ability to determine which species and interactions are important to maintain the multiple functions of ecosystems10. Here we develop a framework -derived from a resource-consumer-function tensor analysis-that bridges these gaps by framing biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality in terms of multilayer ecological network theory. Its application to recently collected ecological data -- reporting weighted interactions between plants, animals and fungi across multiple function types--allows to (i) unveil and quantify the existence of both (multi-functional) keystone species and a dual function keystoneness pattern, and (ii) project plants and functions into a similarity space where clear clusters emerge and the importance of weak links is manifested. This dual insight from species and functional perspectives will better guide conservation efforts to reduce biodiversity loss.\nInferring interactions from microbiome data\nAuthors: Zapien-Campos, R.; Bansept, F.; Traulsen, A.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534939\nParameter inference of high-dimensional data is challenging and microbiome time series data is no exception. Methods aimed at predicting from point estimates exist, but often even fail to recover the true parameters from simulated data. Computational methods to robustly infer and quantify the uncertainty in model parameters are needed. Here, we propose a computational workflow addressing such challenges -- allowing us to compare mechanistic models and identify the values and the certainty of inferred parameters. This approach allows us to infer which kind of interactions occur in the microbial community. In contrast to point-estimate inference, the distribution for the parameters, our outcome, reflects their uncertainty. To achieve this, we consider as many equations for the statistical moments of the microbiome as parameters. Our inference workflow, which builds upon a mechanistic foundation of microscopic processes, can take into account that commonly metagenomic datasets only provide information on relative abundances and hosts' ensembles. With our framework, we move from qualitative prediction to quantifying the likelihood of certain interaction types in microbiomes.\nWhat explains the high island endemicity of Philippine Rafflesia? A species distribution modeling analysis of three threatened parasitic plant species and their hosts\nAuthors: Obico, J. J. A.; Lapuz, R. S.; Barcelona, J. F.; Pelser, P. B.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548437\nPremiseRafflesia are rare holoparasitic plants. In the Philippines, all but one species are found only on single islands. This study aimed to better understand the factors contributing to this distribution pattern. Specifically, we sought to determine whether narrow environmental tolerances of host and/or parasite species might explain their island endemicity, or, instead or in addition, the limited distribution of Rafflesia species is the result of a narrow overlap between the environmental requirements of host and parasite. MethodsWe used Maxent species distribution modeling to identify areas with suitable habitat for R. lagascae, R. lobata, and R. speciosa and their Tetrastigma host species. These analyses were carried out for current climate conditions as well as two future climate change scenarios. Key resultsWhereas species distribution models indicated suitable environmental conditions for the Tetrastigma host species in many parts of the Philippines, considerably fewer areas have suitable conditions for the three Rafflesia species. Some of these areas are found on islands from which they have not been reported. All three species will face significant threats as a result of climate change. For R. lagascae and R. lobata, these may include a loss of suitable area as a result of changes to the distribution of their host species. ConclusionsOur results suggest that limited inter-island dispersal abilities and/or specific environmental requirements are likely responsible for the current pattern of island endemicity of the three Rafflesia species, rather than the environmental requirements of their Tetrastigma host species.\nCranes soar on thermal updrafts behind cold fronts as they migrate across the sea\nAuthors: Pekarsky, S.; Shohami, D.; Horvitz, N.; Bowie, R. C. K.; Kamath, P.; Markin, Y.; Getz, W.; Nathan, R.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547013\nThermal soaring conditions above the sea have long been assumed absent or too weak for terrestrial migrating birds, forcing large obligate soarers to take long detours and avoid sea crossing, and facultative soarers to cross exclusively by costly flapping flight. Thus, while atmospheric convection does develop at sea and is utilized by some seabirds, it has been largely ignored in avian migration research. Here we provide direct evidence for routine thermal soaring over open sea in the common crane, the heaviest facultative soarer known among terrestrial migrating birds. Using high-resolution biologging from 44 cranes tracked across their transcontinental migration over 4 years, we show that soaring characteristics and performance were no different over sea than over land in mid-latitudes. Sea-soaring occurred predominantly in autumn when large water-air temperature difference followed mid-latitude cyclones. Our findings challenge a fundamental paradigm in avian migration research and suggest that large soaring migrants avoid sea crossing not due to absence or weakness of thermals but due to their uncertainty and the costs of prolonged flapping. Marine cold air outbreaks, imperative to the global energy budget and climate system, may also be important for bird migration, calling for more multidisciplinary research across biological and atmospheric sciences.\nThe equilibrium theory of biodiversity dynamics: a general framework for scaling species richness and community abundance along environmental gradients\nAuthors: Okie, J. G.; Storch, D.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549376\nLarge-scale temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns have traditionally been explained by multitudinous particular factors and a few theories. However, these theories lack sufficient generality and problematically do not address fundamental interrelationships and coupled dynamics between resource availability, community abundance, and species richness. We propose the equilibrium theory of biodiversity dynamics (ETBD) to address these linkages, including the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship and phenomena such as niche complementarity, facilitation, and ecosystem engineering. It shows how tipping points and alternative stable states in both diversity and community abundance emerge from nonlinear BEF relationships and the dependence of origination and extinction on population size. ETBD predicts how the strength of the BEF affects scaling relationships between species richness and (meta)community abundance along different environmental gradients. Using data on global-scale variation in tree species richness, we show how the general framework is useful for clarifying the role of speciation, extinction, resource availability, and temperature in driving biodiversity patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient.\nTar patties are hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover and nitrogen fixation during a nearshore pollution event in the oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea\nAuthors: Rubin-Blum, M.; Yudkovsky, Y.; Marmen, S.; Raveh, O.; Amrani, A.; Kutuzov, I.; Guy-Haim, T.; Rahav, E.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.546273\nWeathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.\nCompetition for light can drive adverse species-composition shifts in the Amazon Forest under elevated CO2\nAuthors: Joshi, J.; Hofhansl, F.; Singh, S.; Stocker, B.; Brännström, A.; Franklin, O.; Blanco, C.

C.; Dieckmann, U.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547575\nThe resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.\nA framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and large-scale dispersal\nAuthors: Retkute, R.; Thurston, W.; Cressman, K.; Gilligan, C. A.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548524\nAs climate change leads to new areas being under threat from emerg-ing pests, there is increasing demand for approaches combining mechanistic models and geospatial information. Forecasting based on modelling can in-form surveillance, early warning and management. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and migra-tion using knowledge of pest biology, climate and remote sensing data, wind trajectories and desert locust survey data from Locust Hub (FAO). Fur-thermore, we propose an algorithm for forecasting short-term and long-term desert locust migration based on limited reporting data.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Across the tree of life, organismal functional strategies form a continuum from slow-to fast-growing organisms, in response to common drivers such as resource availability and disturbance. However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for &gt;2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a  slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that  slow and  fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIThe dramatic increase in poultry production and consumption (PPC) over the past decades has raised questions about its impacts on biodiversity, particularly in the Global South. This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asias largest livestock wet market, located next to the continents largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012.
C_LIO_LIDaily processing of &gt;100,000 poultry-fowls at Ghazipur results in an annual production of [~]27,375 metric tonnes of poultry-waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately &gt;33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter-remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. Absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. This raises vital questions about microclimate impacts by green house gases (GHG) released from massive amounts of routine detritus. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste.
C_LIO_LIPublic health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic-lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains.
C_LIO_LIWaste-biomass driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food-waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats.

Lay SummaryO_LIThe global trend of increasing consumption of broiler chickens, driven by rising incomes in tropical cities, has significant ecological implications for both native and migratory birds, as well as other commensal species.
C_LIO_LIThe resulting large amounts of debris produced by poultry production and consumption have created a &#34;chicken reconfigured biosphere&#34; in cities along migratory paths.
C_LIO_LITo better understand the local and global impacts of poultry production and consumption chains, I conducted a long-term study at Asias largest livestock wet market in Ghazipur, Delhi.
C_LIO_LIThe findings reveal that informal handling of poultry waste and cultural practices have had significant impacts on animals that scavenge on the slaughter remains, particularly during the bird flu and COVID-19 pandemics.
C_LIO_LIThe study recommends ways to minimise conflicts and health risks and reduce the potential impacts of rotting garbage on the climate by accommodating animals that have adapted to shared urban environments.

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how biotic interactions affect ecosystem functioning has been a research priority in natural sciences due to their critical role in bolstering ecological resilience1-3. Yet, traditional assessment of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species effective interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g. pollination4 or seed dispersal5), overlooking the synergistic effect of multiple functions that further underpin species-function and function-function interactions in multifunctional ecosystems. At the same time, while ecological network theory holds a potential to quantify the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality6, 7, its connection has been done mainly conceptually, due to challenges measuring different interactions and establishing their relevance across multiple niche dimensions8, 9. Such lack of quantitative studies therefore limits our ability to determine which species and interactions are important to maintain the multiple functions of ecosystems10. Here we develop a framework -derived from a resource-consumer-function tensor analysis-that bridges these gaps by framing biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality in terms of multilayer ecological network theory. Its application to recently collected ecological data -- reporting weighted interactions between plants, animals and fungi across multiple function types--allows to (i) unveil and quantify the existence of both (multi-functional) keystone species and a dual function keystoneness pattern, and (ii) project plants and functions into a similarity space where clear clusters emerge and the importance of weak links is manifested. This dual insight from species and functional perspectives will better guide conservation efforts to reduce biodiversity loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parameter inference of high-dimensional data is challenging and microbiome time series data is no exception. Methods aimed at predicting from point estimates exist, but often even fail to recover the true parameters from simulated data. Computational methods to robustly infer and quantify the uncertainty in model parameters are needed. Here, we propose a computational workflow addressing such challenges -- allowing us to compare mechanistic models and identify the values and the certainty of inferred parameters. This approach allows us to infer which kind of interactions occur in the microbial community. In contrast to point-estimate inference, the distribution for the parameters, our outcome, reflects their uncertainty. To achieve this, we consider as many equations for the statistical moments of the microbiome as parameters. Our inference workflow, which builds upon a mechanistic foundation of microscopic processes, can take into account that commonly metagenomic datasets only provide information on relative abundances and hosts&#39; ensembles. With our framework, we move from qualitative prediction to quantifying the likelihood of certain interaction types in microbiomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PremiseRafflesia are rare holoparasitic plants. In the Philippines, all but one species are found only on single islands. This study aimed to better understand the factors contributing to this distribution pattern. Specifically, we sought to determine whether narrow environmental tolerances of host and/or parasite species might explain their island endemicity, or, instead or in addition, the limited distribution of Rafflesia species is the result of a narrow overlap between the environmental requirements of host and parasite.

MethodsWe used Maxent species distribution modeling to identify areas with suitable habitat for R. lagascae, R. lobata, and R. speciosa and their Tetrastigma host species. These analyses were carried out for current climate conditions as well as two future climate change scenarios.

Key resultsWhereas species distribution models indicated suitable environmental conditions for the Tetrastigma host species in many parts of the Philippines, considerably fewer areas have suitable conditions for the three Rafflesia species. Some of these areas are found on islands from which they have not been reported. All three species will face significant threats as a result of climate change. For R. lagascae and R. lobata, these may include a loss of suitable area as a result of changes to the distribution of their host species.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that limited inter-island dispersal abilities and/or specific environmental requirements are likely responsible for the current pattern of island endemicity of the three Rafflesia species, rather than the environmental requirements of their Tetrastigma host species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermal soaring conditions above the sea have long been assumed absent or too weak for terrestrial migrating birds, forcing large obligate soarers to take long detours and avoid sea crossing, and facultative soarers to cross exclusively by costly flapping flight. Thus, while atmospheric convection does develop at sea and is utilized by some seabirds, it has been largely ignored in avian migration research. Here we provide direct evidence for routine thermal soaring over open sea in the common crane, the heaviest facultative soarer known among terrestrial migrating birds. Using high-resolution biologging from 44 cranes tracked across their transcontinental migration over 4 years, we show that soaring characteristics and performance were no different over sea than over land in mid-latitudes. Sea-soaring occurred predominantly in autumn when large water-air temperature difference followed mid-latitude cyclones. Our findings challenge a fundamental paradigm in avian migration research and suggest that large soaring migrants avoid sea crossing not due to absence or weakness of thermals but due to their uncertainty and the costs of prolonged flapping. Marine cold air outbreaks, imperative to the global energy budget and climate system, may also be important for bird migration, calling for more multidisciplinary research across biological and atmospheric sciences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large-scale temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns have traditionally been explained by multitudinous particular factors and a few theories. However, these theories lack sufficient generality and problematically do not address fundamental interrelationships and coupled dynamics between resource availability, community abundance, and species richness. We propose the equilibrium theory of biodiversity dynamics (ETBD) to address these linkages, including the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship and phenomena such as niche complementarity, facilitation, and ecosystem engineering. It shows how tipping points and alternative stable states in both diversity and community abundance emerge from nonlinear BEF relationships and the dependence of origination and extinction on population size. ETBD predicts how the strength of the BEF affects scaling relationships between species richness and (meta)community abundance along different environmental gradients. Using data on global-scale variation in tree species richness, we show how the general framework is useful for clarifying the role of speciation, extinction, resource availability, and temperature in driving biodiversity patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Weathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As climate change leads to new areas being under threat from emerg-ing pests, there is increasing demand for approaches combining mechanistic models and geospatial information. Forecasting based on modelling can in-form surveillance, early warning and management. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and migra-tion using knowledge of pest biology, climate and remote sensing data, wind trajectories and desert locust survey data from Locust Hub (FAO). Fur-thermore, we propose an algorithm for forecasting short-term and long-term desert locust migration based on limited reporting data.</p>
