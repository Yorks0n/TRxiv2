M.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547400\nUnderstanding how biotic interactions affect ecosystem functioning has been a research priority in natural sciences due to their critical role in bolstering ecological resilience1-3. Yet, traditional assessment of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species effective interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g. pollination4 or seed dispersal5), overlooking the synergistic effect of multiple functions that further underpin species-function and function-function interactions in multifunctional ecosystems. At the same time, while ecological network theory holds a potential to quantify the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality6, 7, its connection has been done mainly conceptually, due to challenges measuring different interactions and establishing their relevance across multiple niche dimensions8, 9. Such lack of quantitative studies therefore limits our ability to determine which species and interactions are important to maintain the multiple functions of ecosystems10. Here we develop a framework -derived from a resource-consumer-function tensor analysis-that bridges these gaps by framing biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality in terms of multilayer ecological network theory. Its application to recently collected ecological data -- reporting weighted interactions between plants, animals and fungi across multiple function types--allows to (i) unveil and quantify the existence of both (multi-functional) keystone species and a dual function keystoneness pattern, and (ii) project plants and functions into a similarity space where clear clusters emerge and the importance of weak links is manifested. This dual insight from species and functional perspectives will better guide conservation efforts to reduce biodiversity loss.\nEcological Impacts of Poultry Waste on Urban Raptors: Conflicts, Diseases, and Climate Change Implications amidst Pandemic Threats\nAuthors: Kumar, N.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.546415\n1. The dramatic increase in poultry production and consumption (PPC) over the past decades has raised questions about its impacts on biodiversity, particularly in the Global South. This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asia's largest livestock wet market, located next to the continent's largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012. 2. Daily processing of \u003e100,000 poultry fowls at Ghazipur results in annual production of ~27,375 metric tonnes of poultry waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, and migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately \u003e33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed of 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. The absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable the exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste. 3. Public health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains. 4. Waste-biomass-driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological and climatic impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes, must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for the conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats.\nDiversity loss in microbial ecosystems undergoing gradual environmental changes\nAuthors: Berger, A.; Gatt Harari, M.; Gross, A.; Erez, A.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548183\nMicrobial ecosystems in soils, oceans, and other environments are essential for global ecological stability. Environmental shifts are anticipated to trigger destabilizing events across the planet. In this study, we model how gradual environmental changes impact ecosystems, specifically when leading to a loss of diversity. We investigate how an ecosystem, within a serial-dilution setup, relaxes to a stable steady state. Our results reveal that as an ecosystem approaches its loss of diversity transition, its dynamics slow down. Consequently, diverse ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest soils, gradually driven past their transition point may exhibit a significant response lag. This suggests that some ecosystems may be closer to a collapse in diversity than current observations indicate. Although our model does not capture the full complexity of real-world ecosystems, it highlights critical aspects underlying the loss of biodiversity in changing environments. This has potential implications for empirical studies and when planning interventions.\nWhat explains the high island endemicity of Philippine Rafflesia? A species distribution modeling analysis of three threatened parasitic plant species and their hosts\nAuthors: Obico, J. J. A.; Lapuz, R. S.; Barcelona, J. F.; Pelser, P. B.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548437\nPremiseRafflesia are rare holoparasitic plants. In the Philippines, all but one species are found only on single islands. This study aimed to better understand the factors contributing to this distribution pattern. Specifically, we sought to determine whether narrow environmental tolerances of host and/or parasite species might explain their island endemicity, or, instead or in addition, the limited distribution of Rafflesia species is the result of a narrow overlap between the environmental requirements of host and parasite. MethodsWe used Maxent species distribution modeling to identify areas with suitable habitat for R. lagascae, R. lobata, and R. speciosa and their Tetrastigma host species. These analyses were carried out for current climate conditions as well as two future climate change scenarios. Key resultsWhereas species distribution models indicated suitable environmental conditions for the Tetrastigma host species in many parts of the Philippines, considerably fewer areas have suitable conditions for the three Rafflesia species. Some of these areas are found on islands from which they have not been reported. All three species will face significant threats as a result of climate change. For R. lagascae and R. lobata, these may include a loss of suitable area as a result of changes to the distribution of their host species. ConclusionsOur results suggest that limited inter-island dispersal abilities and/or specific environmental requirements are likely responsible for the current pattern of island endemicity of the three Rafflesia species, rather than the environmental requirements of their Tetrastigma host species.\nCranes soar on thermal updrafts behind cold fronts as they migrate across the sea\nAuthors: Pekarsky, S.; Shohami, D.; Horvitz, N.; Bowie, R. C. K.; Kamath, P.; Markin, Y.; Getz, W.; Nathan, R.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547013\nThermal soaring conditions above the sea have long been assumed absent or too weak for terrestrial migrating birds, forcing large obligate soarers to take long detours and avoid sea crossing, and facultative soarers to cross exclusively by costly flapping flight. Thus, while atmospheric convection does develop at sea and is utilized by some seabirds, it has been largely ignored in avian migration research. Here we provide direct evidence for routine thermal soaring over open sea in the common crane, the heaviest facultative soarer known among terrestrial migrating birds. Using high-resolution biologging from 44 cranes tracked across their transcontinental migration over 4 years, we show that soaring characteristics and performance were no different over sea than over land in mid-latitudes. Sea-soaring occurred predominantly in autumn when large water-air temperature difference followed mid-latitude cyclones. Our findings challenge a fundamental paradigm in avian migration research and suggest that large soaring migrants avoid sea crossing not due to absence or weakness of thermals but due to their uncertainty and the costs of prolonged flapping. Marine cold air outbreaks, imperative to the global energy budget and climate system, may also be important for bird migration, calling for more multidisciplinary research across biological and atmospheric sciences.\nCompetition for light can drive adverse species-composition shifts in the Amazon Forest under elevated CO2\nAuthors: Joshi, J.; Hofhansl, F.; Singh, S.; Stocker, B.; Brännström, A.; Franklin, O.; Blanco, C. C.; Aleixo, I. F.; Lapola, D. M.; Prentice, I. C.; Dieckmann, U.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547575\nThe resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.\nEpigenetic variation causes heritable variation in complex traits in the mollusk Biomphalaria glabrata, vector of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni\nAuthors: Luviano, N.; Lopez, M.; Gawehns, F.; Haegeman, B.; Mouginot, P.; Chaparro, C.; Arimondo, P. B.; Pujol, B.; Pouzol, D.; Cosseau, C.; Grunau, C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.08.548202\nDNA methylation variation may play a role in phenotypic variation as it can be directly affected by the environment and be inherited. DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84{+/-}5% but only 68{+/-}21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47{+/-}7% in control RILs and 59{+/-}18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs. We found that the heritability h2 of the fecundity in the epiRILs was between 0.5 and 0.6 depending on the method used to estimate it. We developed a model for introducing epimutant offspring snails into resident susceptible populations. If genetic assimilation of the resistant phenotype occured in a small fraction of the introduced epimutant snails, we predict that the susceptible phenotype is replaced by the resistant phenotype after 50-70 generations.\nGIFT an R package to access the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits\nAuthors: Denelle, P.; Weigelt, P.; Kreft, H.\nScore: 180.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546704\nO_LIAdvancing knowledge of biodiversity requires open-access global databases and workflows. This appears particularly crucial for plants, as ongoing changes pose major threats to this central group of organisms. Having large-scale information on plant distributions, functional traits and evolutionary history will enable the scientific community to improve its understanding of the patterns and drivers of plant diversity on a global scale. C_LIO_LIThe Global Inventory of Floras and Traits (GIFT) is a global database of regional plant checklists that has proven successful in documenting biogeographical and geographical patterns of plants. Since the release of the first version of GIFT, the database kept on expanding. We introduce GIFT version 3.0, which contains 5,169 checklists referring to 3,400 regions. These checklists include a total of 371,148 land plant species, mostly vascular plants, of which 354,848 are accepted species names, and 109 functional traits. This new version uses new resources for taxonomic name standardization, is matched to a new plant phylogeny, comes with a new trait aggregation workflow, and includes additional environmental variables. C_LIO_LIWe also present the GIFT R-package, which contains all necessary functions to retrieve distributional, functional, phylogenetic, and environmental data from the GIFT database. The package comes with a dedicated website, https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/, which includes three rich vignettes to guide users in retrieving data from GIFT. C_LIO_LIThe recent development of GIFT and its associated R-package provide ecologists with access to one of the largest plant databases. This will foster research into regional to global patterns of plant diversity and their underlying mechanisms. Proper versioning of the database and the ability to retrieve and cite data from any previous and current instance of the GIFT database will ensure the reproducibility of studies that utilize it. C_LI\nA framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and large-scale dispersal\nAuthors: Retkute, R.; Thurston, W.; Cressman, K.; Gilligan, C. A.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548524\nAs climate change leads to new areas being under threat from emerging pests, there is increasing demand for approaches combining mechanistic models and geospatial information. Forecasting based on modelling can inform surveillance, early warning and management. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and migration using knowledge of pest biology, climate and remote sensing data, wind trajectories and desert locust survey data from Locust Hub (FAO). Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for forecasting short-term and long-term desert locust migration based on limited reporting data.\nThe DeepFaune initiative: a collaborative effort towards the automatic identification of the French fauna in camera-trap images\nAuthors: Rigoudy, N.; Dussert, G.; Benyoub, A.; Besnard, A.; Birck, C.; Boyer, J.; Bollet, Y.; Bunz, Y.; Caussimont, G.; Chetouane, E.; Chiffard-Carriburu, J.; Cornette, P.; Delestrade, A.; De Backer, N.; Dispan, L.; Le Barh, M.; Duhayer, J.; Elder, J.-F.; Fanjul, J.-B.; Fonderflick, J.; Froustey, N.; Garel, M.; Gaudry, W.; Gerard, A.; Gimenez, O.; Hemery, A.; Hemon, A.; Jullien, J.-M.; Knitter, D.; Malafosse, I.; Marginean, M.; Menard, L.; Ouvrier, A.; Pariset, G.; Prunet, V.; Rabault, J.; Randon, M.; Raulet, Y.; Regnier, A.; Ribiere, R.; Ricci, J.-C.; Ruette, S.; Schneylin, Y.; Sentilles, J.; Siefert\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.15.484324\nCamera traps have revolutionized how ecologists monitor wildlife, but their full potential is realized only when the hundreds of thousands of collected images can be readily classified with minimal human intervention. Deep-learning classification models have allowed extraordinary progress towards this end, but trained models remain rare and are only now emerging for European fauna. We report on the first milestone of the DeepFaune initiative (https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr), a large-scale collaboration between more than 50 partners involved in wildlife research, conservation and management in France. We developed a classification model trained to recognize 26 species or higher-level taxa. The classification model achieved 0.97 validation accuracy and often \u003e0.95 precision and recall for many classes. These performances were generally higher than 0.90 when tested on independent out-of-sample datasets for which we used image redundancy contained in sequence of images. We implemented our model in a software to classify images stored locally on a personal computer, so as to provide a free, user-friendly and high-performance tool for wildlife practitioners to automatically classify camera-trap images.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how biotic interactions affect ecosystem functioning has been a research priority in natural sciences due to their critical role in bolstering ecological resilience1-3. Yet, traditional assessment of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species effective interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g. pollination4 or seed dispersal5), overlooking the synergistic effect of multiple functions that further underpin species-function and function-function interactions in multifunctional ecosystems. At the same time, while ecological network theory holds a potential to quantify the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality6, 7, its connection has been done mainly conceptually, due to challenges measuring different interactions and establishing their relevance across multiple niche dimensions8, 9. Such lack of quantitative studies therefore limits our ability to determine which species and interactions are important to maintain the multiple functions of ecosystems10. Here we develop a framework -derived from a resource-consumer-function tensor analysis-that bridges these gaps by framing biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality in terms of multilayer ecological network theory. Its application to recently collected ecological data -- reporting weighted interactions between plants, animals and fungi across multiple function types--allows to (i) unveil and quantify the existence of both (multi-functional) keystone species and a dual function keystoneness pattern, and (ii) project plants and functions into a similarity space where clear clusters emerge and the importance of weak links is manifested. This dual insight from species and functional perspectives will better guide conservation efforts to reduce biodiversity loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1. The dramatic increase in poultry production and consumption (PPC) over the past decades has raised questions about its impacts on biodiversity, particularly in the Global South. This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asia&#39;s largest livestock wet market, located next to the continent&#39;s largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012. 2. Daily processing of &gt;100,000 poultry fowls at Ghazipur results in annual production of ~27,375 metric tonnes of poultry waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, and migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately &gt;33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed of 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. The absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable the exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste. 3. Public health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains. 4. Waste-biomass-driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological and climatic impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes, must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for the conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial ecosystems in soils, oceans, and other environments are essential for global ecological stability. Environmental shifts are anticipated to trigger destabilizing events across the planet. In this study, we model how gradual environmental changes impact ecosystems, specifically when leading to a loss of diversity. We investigate how an ecosystem, within a serial-dilution setup, relaxes to a stable steady state. Our results reveal that as an ecosystem approaches its loss of diversity transition, its dynamics slow down. Consequently, diverse ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest soils, gradually driven past their transition point may exhibit a significant response lag. This suggests that some ecosystems may be closer to a collapse in diversity than current observations indicate. Although our model does not capture the full complexity of real-world ecosystems, it highlights critical aspects underlying the loss of biodiversity in changing environments. This has potential implications for empirical studies and when planning interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PremiseRafflesia are rare holoparasitic plants. In the Philippines, all but one species are found only on single islands. This study aimed to better understand the factors contributing to this distribution pattern. Specifically, we sought to determine whether narrow environmental tolerances of host and/or parasite species might explain their island endemicity, or, instead or in addition, the limited distribution of Rafflesia species is the result of a narrow overlap between the environmental requirements of host and parasite.

MethodsWe used Maxent species distribution modeling to identify areas with suitable habitat for R. lagascae, R. lobata, and R. speciosa and their Tetrastigma host species. These analyses were carried out for current climate conditions as well as two future climate change scenarios.

Key resultsWhereas species distribution models indicated suitable environmental conditions for the Tetrastigma host species in many parts of the Philippines, considerably fewer areas have suitable conditions for the three Rafflesia species. Some of these areas are found on islands from which they have not been reported. All three species will face significant threats as a result of climate change. For R. lagascae and R. lobata, these may include a loss of suitable area as a result of changes to the distribution of their host species.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that limited inter-island dispersal abilities and/or specific environmental requirements are likely responsible for the current pattern of island endemicity of the three Rafflesia species, rather than the environmental requirements of their Tetrastigma host species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thermal soaring conditions above the sea have long been assumed absent or too weak for terrestrial migrating birds, forcing large obligate soarers to take long detours and avoid sea crossing, and facultative soarers to cross exclusively by costly flapping flight. Thus, while atmospheric convection does develop at sea and is utilized by some seabirds, it has been largely ignored in avian migration research. Here we provide direct evidence for routine thermal soaring over open sea in the common crane, the heaviest facultative soarer known among terrestrial migrating birds. Using high-resolution biologging from 44 cranes tracked across their transcontinental migration over 4 years, we show that soaring characteristics and performance were no different over sea than over land in mid-latitudes. Sea-soaring occurred predominantly in autumn when large water-air temperature difference followed mid-latitude cyclones. Our findings challenge a fundamental paradigm in avian migration research and suggest that large soaring migrants avoid sea crossing not due to absence or weakness of thermals but due to their uncertainty and the costs of prolonged flapping. Marine cold air outbreaks, imperative to the global energy budget and climate system, may also be important for bird migration, calling for more multidisciplinary research across biological and atmospheric sciences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales. These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA methylation variation may play a role in phenotypic variation as it can be directly affected by the environment and be inherited. DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84{&#43;/-}5% but only 68{&#43;/-}21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47{&#43;/-}7% in control RILs and 59{&#43;/-}18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs. We found that the heritability h2 of the fecundity in the epiRILs was between 0.5 and 0.6 depending on the method used to estimate it. We developed a model for introducing epimutant offspring snails into resident susceptible populations. If genetic assimilation of the resistant phenotype occured in a small fraction of the introduced epimutant snails, we predict that the susceptible phenotype is replaced by the resistant phenotype after 50-70 generations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIAdvancing knowledge of biodiversity requires open-access global databases and workflows. This appears particularly crucial for plants, as ongoing changes pose major threats to this central group of organisms. Having large-scale information on plant distributions, functional traits and evolutionary history will enable the scientific community to improve its understanding of the patterns and drivers of plant diversity on a global scale.
C_LIO_LIThe Global Inventory of Floras and Traits (GIFT) is a global database of regional plant checklists that has proven successful in documenting biogeographical and geographical patterns of plants. Since the release of the first version of GIFT, the database kept on expanding. We introduce GIFT version 3.0, which contains 5,169 checklists referring to 3,400 regions. These checklists include a total of 371,148 land plant species, mostly vascular plants, of which 354,848 are accepted species names, and 109 functional traits. This new version uses new resources for taxonomic name standardization, is matched to a new plant phylogeny, comes with a new trait aggregation workflow, and includes additional environmental variables.
C_LIO_LIWe also present the GIFT R-package, which contains all necessary functions to retrieve distributional, functional, phylogenetic, and environmental data from the GIFT database. The package comes with a dedicated website, https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/, which includes three rich vignettes to guide users in retrieving data from GIFT.
C_LIO_LIThe recent development of GIFT and its associated R-package provide ecologists with access to one of the largest plant databases. This will foster research into regional to global patterns of plant diversity and their underlying mechanisms. Proper versioning of the database and the ability to retrieve and cite data from any previous and current instance of the GIFT database will ensure the reproducibility of studies that utilize it.

        <p class="abstract">As climate change leads to new areas being under threat from emerging pests, there is increasing demand for approaches combining mechanistic models and geospatial information. Forecasting based on modelling can inform surveillance, early warning and management. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling desert locust population dynamics and migration using knowledge of pest biology, climate and remote sensing data, wind trajectories and desert locust survey data from Locust Hub (FAO). Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for forecasting short-term and long-term desert locust migration based on limited reporting data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Camera traps have revolutionized how ecologists monitor wildlife, but their full potential is realized only when the hundreds of thousands of collected images can be readily classified with minimal human intervention. Deep-learning classification models have allowed extraordinary progress towards this end, but trained models remain rare and are only now emerging for European fauna. We report on the first milestone of the DeepFaune initiative (https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr), a large-scale collaboration between more than 50 partners involved in wildlife research, conservation and management in France. We developed a classification model trained to recognize 26 species or higher-level taxa. The classification model achieved 0.97 validation accuracy and often &gt;0.95 precision and recall for many classes. These performances were generally higher than 0.90 when tested on independent out-of-sample datasets for which we used image redundancy contained in sequence of images. We implemented our model in a software to classify images stored locally on a personal computer, so as to provide a free, user-friendly and high-performance tool for wildlife practitioners to automatically classify camera-trap images.</p>
