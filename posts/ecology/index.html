A.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551160\nDomestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the worlds terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.\nMetabolic complexity drives divergence in microbial communities\nAuthors: Silverstein, M. R.; Bhatnagar, J. M.; Segre, D.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551516\nMicrobial communities are shaped by the metabolites available in their environment, but the principles that govern whether different communities will converge or diverge in any given condition remain unknown, posing fundamental questions about the feasibility of microbiome engineering. To this end, we studied the longitudinal assembly dynamics of a set of natural microbial communities grown in laboratory conditions of increasing metabolic complexity. We found that different microbial communities tend to become similar to each other when grown in metabolically simple conditions, but diverge in composition as the metabolic complexity of the environment increases, a phenomenon we refer to as the divergence-complexity effect. A comparative analysis of these communities revealed that this divergence is driven by community diversity and by the diverse assortment of specialist taxa capable of degrading complex metabolites. An ecological model of community dynamics indicates that the hierarchical structure of metabolism itself, where complex molecules are enzymatically degraded into progressively smaller ones, is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate all of our experimental observations. In addition to pointing to a fundamental principle of community assembly, the divergence-complexity effect has important implications for microbiome engineering applications, as it can provide insight into which environments support multiple community states, enabling the search for desired ecosystem functions.\nEyes on nature: Embedded vision cameras for multidisciplinary biodiversity monitoring\nAuthors: Darras, K. F. A.; Balle, M.; Xu, W.; Yan, Y.; Zakka, V. G.; Toledo-Hernandez, M.; Sheng, D.; Lin, W.; Zhang, B.; Lan, Z.; Fupeng, L.; Wanger, T. C.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550656\nGlobal environmental challenges require comprehensive data to manage and protect biodiversity. Currently, vision-based biodiversity monitoring efforts are mixed, incomplete, human-dependent, and passive. To tackle these issues, we present a portable, modular, low-power device with embedded vision for biodiversity monitoring. Our camera uses interchangeable lenses to resolve barely visible and remote subjects, as well as customisable algorithms for blob detection, region-of-interest classification, and object detection to identify targets. We showcase our system in six case studies from the ethology, landscape ecology, agronomy, pollination ecology, conservation biology, and phenology disciplines. Using the same devices, we discovered bats feeding on durian tree flowers, monitored flying bats and their insect prey, identified nocturnal insect pests in paddy fields, detected bees visiting rapeseed crop flowers, triggered real-time alerts for waterbirds, and tracked flower phenology over months. We measured classification accuracies between 55% and 96% in our field surveys and used them to standardise observations over highly-resolved time scales. The cameras are amenable to situations where automated vision-based monitoring is required off the grid, in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and in particular for quantifying species interactions. Embedded vision devices such as this will help addressing global biodiversity challenges and facilitate a technology-aided global food systems transformation.\nDeclines in ice cover induce light limitation in freshwater diatoms\nAuthors: Zepernick, B. N.; Chase, E. E.; Denison, E. R.; Gilbert, N. E.; Martin, R. M.; Truchon, A. R.; Frenken, T.; Cody, W. R.; Chaffin, J. D.; Bullerjahn, G. S.; McKay, R. M.; Wilhelm, S. W.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551672\nThe rediscovery of diatom blooms embedded within and beneath Lake Erie ice cover (2007-2012) ignited an intense interest in psychrophilic adaptations and winter limnology. Subsequent studies determined ice plays a vital role in winter diatom ecophysiology, as diatoms partition to the underside of ice thereby fixing their location within the photic zone. Yet, climate change has led to widespread ice decline across the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie presenting a nearly ice-free state in several recent winters. It has been hypothesized the resultant turbid, isothermal water column will induce light limitation amongst winter diatoms, serving as a detrimental competitive disadvantage. Here, we conducted a physiochemical and metatranscriptomic survey of the winter Lake Erie water column (2019-2020) that spanned spatial, temporal, and climatic gradients to investigate this hypothesis. We determined ice-free conditions decreased diatom bloom magnitude and altered diatom community composition. Diatoms increased the expression of various photosynthetic genes and iron transporters, suggesting they are attempting to increase their quantity of photosystems and light-harvesting components (a well-defined indicator of light limitation). Notably, we identified two gene families which serve to increase diatom fitness in the turbid ice-free water column: proton-pumping rhodopsins (a second means of light-driven energy acquisition) and fasciclins (a means to \"raft\" together to increase buoyancy and co-locate to the surface to optimize light acquisition). With large-scale climatic changes already underway, our observations provide insight into how diatoms respond to the dynamic ice conditions of today and shed light on how they will fare in a climatically altered tomorrow.\nIsolation and genomic characterization of the tick-borne relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia turicatae, from ticks collected in a peridomestic setting of Camayeca, Mexico\nAuthors: Vasquez-Guerrero, E.; Kneubehl, A.

R.; Alecrim, E. F.; Forrest, J. R. K.; Heberling, J. M.; Primack, R. B.; Sargent, R. D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551551\nO_LIRecent evidence suggests that community science and herbarium datasets yield similar estimates of species phenological sensitivities to temperature. Despite this, two recent studies by Alecrim et al. (2023) and Miller et al. (2022) found contradictory results when investigating an identical ecological mechanism (phenological mismatch of wildflower flowering and of shading by deciduous trees; \"phenological escape\") with separate datasets. C_LIO_LIHere, we investigated whether differences between the two studies results could be reconciled by testing four hypotheses related to model design, species selection, spatiotemporal data extent, and phenophase selection. C_LIO_LIHybrid model structures brought results from the two datasets closer together but did not fully reconcile the differences between the studies. Cropping the datasets to match spatial and temporal extents appeared to reconcile most differences but only at the cost of much higher uncertainty associated with reduced sample size. Neither species selection nor phenophase selection seemed to be responsible for differences in results. C_LIO_LISynthesis: Our analysis suggests that although species-level estimates of phenological sensitivity may be similar between crowd-sourced and herbarium datasets, inherent differences in the types and extent of data may lead to contradictory inference about complex biotic interactions. We conclude that, until community science data repositories grow to match the range of climate conditions present in herbarium collections or until herbarium collections grow to match the spatial extent and temporal frequency of community science repositories, ecological studies should ideally be evaluated using both datasets to test the possibility of biased results from either.

G.; Baggaley, A. W.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551748\nTree populations worldwide are facing an unprecedented threat from a variety of tree diseases and invasive pests. Their spread, exacerbated by increasing globalisation and climate change, has an enormous environmental, economic and social impact. Computational agent-based models are a popular tool for describing and forecasting the spread of tree diseases due to their flexibility and ability to reveal collective behaviours. In this paper we present a versatile agentbased model with a Gaussian infectivity kernel to describe the spread of a generic tree disease through a synthetic treescape. We then explore several methods of calculating the basic reproduction number R0, a characteristic measurement of disease infectivity, defining the expected number of new infections resulting from one newly infected individual throughout their infectious period. It is a useful comparative summary parameter of a disease and can be used to explore the threshold dynamics of epidemics through mathematical models. We demonstrate several methods of estimating R0 through the agent-based model, including contact tracing, inferring the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model parameters using the linear noise approximation, and an analytical approximation. As an illustrative example, we then use the model and each of the methods to calculate estimates of R0 for the ash dieback epidemic in the UK.\nInfluence of Temperate Forest Autumn Leaf Phenology on Segmentation of Tree Species from UAV Imagery Using Deep Learning\nAuthors: Cloutier, M.; Germain, M.; Laliberte, E.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.548604\nRemote sensing of forests has become increasingly accessible with the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV), along with deep learning, allowing for repeated high-resolution imagery and the capturing of phenological changes at larger spatial and temporal scales. In temperate forests during autumn, leaf senescence occurs when leaves change colour and drop. However, the influence of leaf senescence in temperate forests on tree species segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has not yet been evaluated. Here, we acquired high-resolution UAV imagery over a temperate forest in Quebec, Canada on seven occasions between May and October 2021. We segmented and labelled 23,000 tree crowns from 14 different classes to train and validate a CNN for each imagery acquisition. The CNN-based segmentation showed the highest F1-score (0.72) at the start of leaf colouring in early September and the lowest F1-score (0.61) at peak fall colouring in early October. The timing of the events occurring during senescence, such as leaf colouring and leaf fall, varied substantially between and within species and according to environmental conditions, leading to higher variability in the remotely sensed signal. Deciduous and evergreen tree species that presented distinctive and less temporally-variable traits between individuals were better classified. While tree segmentation in a heterogenous forest remains challenging, UAV imagery and deep learning show high potential in mapping tree species. Our results from a temperate forest with strong leaf colour changes during autumn senescence show that the best performance for tree species segmentation occurs at the onset of this colour change.\nPredictive microbial community changes across a temperature gradient\nAuthors: Sun, X.; Folmar, J.; Favier, A.; Pyenson, N.; Sanchez, A.; Rebolleda-Gomez, M.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550899\nA central challenge in community ecology is predicting the effects of abiotic factors on community assembly. In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding differentiates between micro-habitats within the rocky intertidal\nAuthors: Shea, M. M.; Boehm, A. B.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551543\nWhile the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys for biodiversity monitoring continues to be demonstrated, the spatial and temporal variability of eDNA, and thus the limits of the differentiability of an eDNA signal, remains under-characterized. In this study, we collected eDNA samples from distinct micro-habitats (~40 m apart) in a rocky intertidal ecosystem over their exposure period in a tidal cycle. During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses, using just taxonomically-assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats sampled. This differentiability paralleled ecological expectations and increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in the rocky intertidal only 40 m apart, that these differences are ecologically meaningful, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of differentiation possible. These findings showcase the potential power of eDNA biomonitoring to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of marine biodiversity data, aiding research, conservation, and management efforts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Domestic livestock grazing accounts for roughly one quarter of the worlds terrestrial surface and is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Yet, it also provides a critical livelihood for nearly one billion smallholder farmers, creating a paradox that highlights the need for conservation strategies to balance human and ecological needs. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) integrate trees with livestock pastures, offering a promising solution to boost livestock productivity while safeguarding natural areas and biodiversity. However, evidence for the biodiversity benefits provided by SPS is limited to studies focusing on specific geographic regions or taxa. Through a global meta-analysis of 45 studies spanning 15 countries, four biogeographic regions, and seven taxa, we provide the first quantitative synthesis evaluating how SPS affect biodiversity and community stability relative to treeless pastures and natural forests. Overall, we show that SPS harbor higher levels of biodiversity (i.e., richness, abundance, and diversity) and stability than treeless pastures, and perform comparably to nearby forests. However, variations exist across regions and taxa, with the strongest positive responses in tropical dry regions and for low-mobility taxa like invertebrates and plants. Mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms, on the other hand, showed no significant biodiversity differences between treeless pastures and SPS. Thus, integrating SPS and protected areas as complementary components of a multifunctional landscape will be key to halting multi-taxa biodiversity loss and building sustainable livestock systems. Our findings support the conservation potential of SPS, while underscoring the need for strategic implementation to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial communities are shaped by the metabolites available in their environment, but the principles that govern whether different communities will converge or diverge in any given condition remain unknown, posing fundamental questions about the feasibility of microbiome engineering. To this end, we studied the longitudinal assembly dynamics of a set of natural microbial communities grown in laboratory conditions of increasing metabolic complexity. We found that different microbial communities tend to become similar to each other when grown in metabolically simple conditions, but diverge in composition as the metabolic complexity of the environment increases, a phenomenon we refer to as the divergence-complexity effect. A comparative analysis of these communities revealed that this divergence is driven by community diversity and by the diverse assortment of specialist taxa capable of degrading complex metabolites. An ecological model of community dynamics indicates that the hierarchical structure of metabolism itself, where complex molecules are enzymatically degraded into progressively smaller ones, is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate all of our experimental observations. In addition to pointing to a fundamental principle of community assembly, the divergence-complexity effect has important implications for microbiome engineering applications, as it can provide insight into which environments support multiple community states, enabling the search for desired ecosystem functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global environmental challenges require comprehensive data to manage and protect biodiversity. Currently, vision-based biodiversity monitoring efforts are mixed, incomplete, human-dependent, and passive. To tackle these issues, we present a portable, modular, low-power device with embedded vision for biodiversity monitoring. Our camera uses interchangeable lenses to resolve barely visible and remote subjects, as well as customisable algorithms for blob detection, region-of-interest classification, and object detection to identify targets. We showcase our system in six case studies from the ethology, landscape ecology, agronomy, pollination ecology, conservation biology, and phenology disciplines. Using the same devices, we discovered bats feeding on durian tree flowers, monitored flying bats and their insect prey, identified nocturnal insect pests in paddy fields, detected bees visiting rapeseed crop flowers, triggered real-time alerts for waterbirds, and tracked flower phenology over months. We measured classification accuracies between 55% and 96% in our field surveys and used them to standardise observations over highly-resolved time scales. The cameras are amenable to situations where automated vision-based monitoring is required off the grid, in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and in particular for quantifying species interactions. Embedded vision devices such as this will help addressing global biodiversity challenges and facilitate a technology-aided global food systems transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rediscovery of diatom blooms embedded within and beneath Lake Erie ice cover (2007-2012) ignited an intense interest in psychrophilic adaptations and winter limnology. Subsequent studies determined ice plays a vital role in winter diatom ecophysiology, as diatoms partition to the underside of ice thereby fixing their location within the photic zone. Yet, climate change has led to widespread ice decline across the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie presenting a nearly ice-free state in several recent winters. It has been hypothesized the resultant turbid, isothermal water column will induce light limitation amongst winter diatoms, serving as a detrimental competitive disadvantage. Here, we conducted a physiochemical and metatranscriptomic survey of the winter Lake Erie water column (2019-2020) that spanned spatial, temporal, and climatic gradients to investigate this hypothesis. We determined ice-free conditions decreased diatom bloom magnitude and altered diatom community composition. Diatoms increased the expression of various photosynthetic genes and iron transporters, suggesting they are attempting to increase their quantity of photosystems and light-harvesting components (a well-defined indicator of light limitation). Notably, we identified two gene families which serve to increase diatom fitness in the turbid ice-free water column: proton-pumping rhodopsins (a second means of light-driven energy acquisition) and fasciclins (a means to &#34;raft&#34; together to increase buoyancy and co-locate to the surface to optimize light acquisition). With large-scale climatic changes already underway, our observations provide insight into how diatoms respond to the dynamic ice conditions of today and shed light on how they will fare in a climatically altered tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIRecent evidence suggests that community science and herbarium datasets yield similar estimates of species phenological sensitivities to temperature. Despite this, two recent studies by Alecrim et al. (2023) and Miller et al. (2022) found contradictory results when investigating an identical ecological mechanism (phenological mismatch of wildflower flowering and of shading by deciduous trees; &#34;phenological escape&#34;) with separate datasets.
C_LIO_LIHere, we investigated whether differences between the two studies results could be reconciled by testing four hypotheses related to model design, species selection, spatiotemporal data extent, and phenophase selection.
C_LIO_LIHybrid model structures brought results from the two datasets closer together but did not fully reconcile the differences between the studies. Cropping the datasets to match spatial and temporal extents appeared to reconcile most differences but only at the cost of much higher uncertainty associated with reduced sample size. Neither species selection nor phenophase selection seemed to be responsible for differences in results.
C_LIO_LISynthesis: Our analysis suggests that although species-level estimates of phenological sensitivity may be similar between crowd-sourced and herbarium datasets, inherent differences in the types and extent of data may lead to contradictory inference about complex biotic interactions. We conclude that, until community science data repositories grow to match the range of climate conditions present in herbarium collections or until herbarium collections grow to match the spatial extent and temporal frequency of community science repositories, ecological studies should ideally be evaluated using both datasets to test the possibility of biased results from either.

        <p class="abstract">Tree populations worldwide are facing an unprecedented threat from a variety of tree diseases and invasive pests. Their spread, exacerbated by increasing globalisation and climate change, has an enormous environmental, economic and social impact. Computational agent-based models are a popular tool for describing and forecasting the spread of tree diseases due to their flexibility and ability to reveal collective behaviours. In this paper we present a versatile agentbased model with a Gaussian infectivity kernel to describe the spread of a generic tree disease through a synthetic treescape. We then explore several methods of calculating the basic reproduction number R0, a characteristic measurement of disease infectivity, defining the expected number of new infections resulting from one newly infected individual throughout their infectious period. It is a useful comparative summary parameter of a disease and can be used to explore the threshold dynamics of epidemics through mathematical models. We demonstrate several methods of estimating R0 through the agent-based model, including contact tracing, inferring the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model parameters using the linear noise approximation, and an analytical approximation. As an illustrative example, we then use the model and each of the methods to calculate estimates of R0 for the ash dieback epidemic in the UK.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Remote sensing of forests has become increasingly accessible with the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV), along with deep learning, allowing for repeated high-resolution imagery and the capturing of phenological changes at larger spatial and temporal scales. In temperate forests during autumn, leaf senescence occurs when leaves change colour and drop. However, the influence of leaf senescence in temperate forests on tree species segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has not yet been evaluated. Here, we acquired high-resolution UAV imagery over a temperate forest in Quebec, Canada on seven occasions between May and October 2021. We segmented and labelled 23,000 tree crowns from 14 different classes to train and validate a CNN for each imagery acquisition. The CNN-based segmentation showed the highest F1-score (0.72) at the start of leaf colouring in early September and the lowest F1-score (0.61) at peak fall colouring in early October. The timing of the events occurring during senescence, such as leaf colouring and leaf fall, varied substantially between and within species and according to environmental conditions, leading to higher variability in the remotely sensed signal. Deciduous and evergreen tree species that presented distinctive and less temporally-variable traits between individuals were better classified. While tree segmentation in a heterogenous forest remains challenging, UAV imagery and deep learning show high potential in mapping tree species. Our results from a temperate forest with strong leaf colour changes during autumn senescence show that the best performance for tree species segmentation occurs at the onset of this colour change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A central challenge in community ecology is predicting the effects of abiotic factors on community assembly. In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.</p>

In this study, we collected eDNA samples from distinct micro-habitats (~40 m apart) in a rocky intertidal ecosystem over their exposure period in a tidal cycle. During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses, using just taxonomically-assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats sampled. This differentiability paralleled ecological expectations and increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in the rocky intertidal only 40 m apart, that these differences are ecologically meaningful, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of differentiation possible. These findings showcase the potential power of eDNA biomonitoring to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of marine biodiversity data, aiding research, conservation, and management efforts.</p>
