Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum.">

However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.\nSounds of the underground reflect soil biodiversity dynamics across a grassy woodland restoration chronosequence\nAuthors: Robinson, J. M.; Taylor, A.; Fickling, N.; Sun, X.; Breed, M. F.\nScore: 54.0, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577311\nFifty-nine percent of the worlds species inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our planets most diverse ecosystems.\nCommunity context influences the conjugation efficiency of E. coli\nAuthors: Bustamante, M.; Koopman, F.; Martens, J.; Brons, J. K.; DelaFuente, J.; Kuipers, O.; van Doorn, G. S.; de Vos, M.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577951\nIn urinary tract infections different bacteria can live in a polymicrobial community, it is unknown how such community members affect the conjugation rate of uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We investigated the influence of the polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI) community context on the conjugation rate of E. coli isolates in artificial urine medium. Pairwise conjugation rate experiments were conducted between a donor E. coli strain containing pOXA-48 and six uropathogenic E. coli isolates in the presence and absence of five community members to elucidate their effect on the rate of conjugation. We found that the basal conjugation rates in the absence of community members are genotype dependent. Interestingly, bacterial interactions have an overall positive effect on E. coli conjugation rates. Particularly Gram-positive enterococcal species were found to enhance the conjugation rates of most uropathogenic E. coli isolates. We hypothesize that the nature and co-culture of the interactions is important for these increased conjugation rates in AUM.\nDNA metabarcoding-based detection of non-indigenous invertebrates in recreational marinas: influence of sample type and seasonal variation\nAuthors: Lavrador, A. S.; Amaral, F. G.; Moutinho, J.; Vieira, P. E.; Costa, F. O.; Duarte, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577180\nMonitoring of marine invertebrate non-indigenous species (NIS) using DNA metabarcoding can be strongly affected by selected sample type due to life history traits, such as habitat preferences and life cycles. Two marinas in the north of Portugal were sampled to assess the impact of sample type (hard and artificial substrates, water eDNA, and zooplankton) and season (spring, autumn, winter) on species and NIS recovery. Using two molecular markers - the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S) - a total of 636 species and 31 NIS were detected. Species numbers were slightly higher in the marina more exposed to maritime traffic, and the highest percentage of exclusive species was detected in zooplankton (up to 24%), as well as the highest numbers of NIS. Regarding season, the highest numbers of species and NIS were detected in the spring and autumn (varying within each marina). Taxonomic composition analysis revealed differences in species richness and community structure among seasons and sample types, particularly between hard and artificial substrates versus eDNA and zooplankton. Of the 31 NIS detected, six are potential first records for Portugal, which await morphology-based validation. No NIS were detected in all sample types nor in all sampled seasons. This highlights the need to employ different sampling approaches and markers, as well as consider seasonal variation and level of exposure to maritime-driven introductions to guarantee a comprehensive metabarcoding-based surveillance of NIS in recreational marinas.\nDynamic coexistence driven by physiological transitions in microbial communities\nAuthors: Narla, A.; Hwa, T.; Murugan, A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575059\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMicrobial ecosystems are commonly modeled by fixed interactions between species in steady exponential growth states. However, microbes often modify their environments so strongly that they are forced out of the exponential state into stressed or non-growing states. Such dynamics are typical of ecological succession in nature and serial-dilution cycles in the laboratory. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model, the Community State model, to gain insight into the dynamic coexistence of microbes due to changes in their physiological states. Our model bypasses specific interactions (e.g., nutrient starvation, stress, aggregation) that lead to different combinations of physiological states, referred to collectively as \"community states\", and modeled by specifying the growth preference of each species along a global ecological coordinate, taken here to be the total community biomass density. We identify three key features of such dynamical communities that contrast starkly with steady-state communities: increased tolerance of community diversity to fast growth rates of species dominating different community states, enhanced community stability through staggered dominance of different species in different community states, and increased requirement on growth dominance for the inclusion of late-growing species. These features, derived explicitly for simplified models, are proposed here to be principles aiding the understanding of complex dynamical communities. Our model shifts the focus of ecosystem dynamics from bottom-up studies based on idealized inter-species interaction to top-down studies based on accessible macroscopic observables such as growth rates and total biomass density, enabling quantitative examination of community-wide characteristics.\nComparative analysis of the plasma metabolome of migrating passerines during stopover: Novel insights into flight metabolism\nAuthors: Domer, A.; Jasinska, W.; Rosental, L.; Shochat, E.; Fernie, A. R.; Alseekh, S.; Brotman, Y.; Ovadia, O.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574878\nDuring long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.\nMitochondrial DNA analysis in ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) raises an urgent conservation need for its southernmost population\nAuthors: Ha, L. M.; Tran, H. D.; Takeshima, H.; Iguchi, K.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577666\nThe central-marginal hypothesis predicts that genetic diversity decreases and genetic differentiation increases toward the species distribution margin. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) collected from different localities, including central and marginal populations, to test the hypothesis. The results show that the ayu populations at southern marginal habitats (Tien Yen River in Vietnam and Yakugachi River in Amami-oshima Island) displayed low genetic diversity (Haplotype diversity, H = 0.52 and 0.67; Nucleotide diversity, Pi = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively) and significantly differed from the central populations (p \u003c 0.001), consistent with the central-marginal hypothesis. However, ayu populations at the center of their distribution range (Shinano River in Honsyu and Hamoji River in Sado Island) and the northern marginal habitats (Yoichi River in Hokkaido and Aonae River in Okushiri Island) exhibited high genetic diversity (H = 1 for all rivers; Pi = 0.024-0.029). The genetic differences between the populations at the center and the northern marginal habitats were insignificant (p \u003e 0.05). This study showed that in ayu, the central-marginal hypothesis is valid in the southern direction but not in the northern direction. Urgent conservation is needed for the genetically distinct population in the degraded southern habitat with severely low genetic diversity.\nDensity dependence shapes life-history trade-offs in a food limited ungulate population\nAuthors: Jaggi, H.; ZUO, W.; Kentie, R.; Gaillard, J.-M.; Coulson, T.; Tuljapurkar, S. D.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577325\nQuantifying trade-offs within populations is an important goal in life-history and evolutionary theory. However, most studies focusing on life-history variation assume trade-offs to be static. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding life-history variation at different densities while enabling us to reveal trade-offs that are often masked due to individual heterogeneity. We use published individual-based data from a population of Soay sheep and find density dependence strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and the distribution of lifetime reproductive success. We find trade-offs between juvenile survival and growth structures life-history variation for Soay sheep at all densities, but the intensity of the trade-offs increases with population density. At carrying capacity (K), a new trade-off appears between reproduction and juvenile survival. In addition, we find the distribution of LRS to be highly constrained at K, with mothers of prime adult sizes ([~] 25kg) contributing the most to reproduction. We also find the effects of density-dependence on demographic measures such as net reproductive rate, stable size distribution, and average vital rate functions. Our results suggest high density limits the diversity of individual life history strategies and has implications for better understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics via density-dependent selection and management of ungulates in food limited environments.\nAssessing the dynamics of Mycobacterium bovis infection in three French badger populations\nAuthors: Calenge, C.; Payne, A.; Reveillaud, E.; Richomme, C.; Girard, S.; Desvaux, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.543041\nThe Sylvatub system is a national surveillance program established in 2011 in France to monitor infections caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the main etiologic agent of bovine tuberculosis, in wild species. This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.\nTracing 600 years of long-distance Atlantic cod trade in medieval and post-medieval Oslo using stable isotopes and ancient DNA\nAuthors: Martinez Garcia, L.; Pulido, A.; Ferrari, G.; Hufthammer, A. K.; Vedeler, M.; Hirons, A.; Kneale, C.; Barrett, J. H.; Star, B.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577044\nMarine resources have been important for the survival and economic development of coastal human communities across northern Europe for centuries. Knowledge of the origin of such historic resources can provide key insights into fishing practices and the spatial extent of trade networks. Here, we combine ancient DNA and stable isotopes ({delta}13C, {delta}15N, non-exchangeable {delta}2H and {delta}34S) to investigate the geographical origin of archaeological cod remains in Oslo from the eleventh to seventeenth centuries CE. Our findings provide genetic evidence that Atlantic cod was obtained from different sources, including a variety of distant-water populations like northern Norway and possibly Iceland. Evidence for such long-distance cod trade is already observed from the eleventh century, contrasting with archaeological and historical evidence from Britain and other areas of Continental Europe around the North and Baltic Seas, where such trade developed in a later period. Diverse biological origins are further supported by significant differences of a range of isotopes, indicating that multiple populations living in different environments were exploited. This research highlights the utility of combining ancient DNA methods and stable isotope analysis to describe the development of marine fisheries during the medieval and post-medieval period.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fifty-nine percent of the worlds species inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our planets most diverse ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In urinary tract infections different bacteria can live in a polymicrobial community, it is unknown how such community members affect the conjugation rate of uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We investigated the influence of the polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI) community context on the conjugation rate of E. coli isolates in artificial urine medium. Pairwise conjugation rate experiments were conducted between a donor E. coli strain containing pOXA-48 and six uropathogenic E. coli isolates in the presence and absence of five community members to elucidate their effect on the rate of conjugation. We found that the basal conjugation rates in the absence of community members are genotype dependent. Interestingly, bacterial interactions have an overall positive effect on E. coli conjugation rates. Particularly Gram-positive enterococcal species were found to enhance the conjugation rates of most uropathogenic E. coli isolates. We hypothesize that the nature and co-culture of the interactions is important for these increased conjugation rates in AUM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring of marine invertebrate non-indigenous species (NIS) using DNA metabarcoding can be strongly affected by selected sample type due to life history traits, such as habitat preferences and life cycles. Two marinas in the north of Portugal were sampled to assess the impact of sample type (hard and artificial substrates, water eDNA, and zooplankton) and season (spring, autumn, winter) on species and NIS recovery. Using two molecular markers - the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S) - a total of 636 species and 31 NIS were detected. Species numbers were slightly higher in the marina more exposed to maritime traffic, and the highest percentage of exclusive species was detected in zooplankton (up to 24%), as well as the highest numbers of NIS. Regarding season, the highest numbers of species and NIS were detected in the spring and autumn (varying within each marina). Taxonomic composition analysis revealed differences in species richness and community structure among seasons and sample types, particularly between hard and artificial substrates versus eDNA and zooplankton. Of the 31 NIS detected, six are potential first records for Portugal, which await morphology-based validation. No NIS were detected in all sample types nor in all sampled seasons. This highlights the need to employ different sampling approaches and markers, as well as consider seasonal variation and level of exposure to maritime-driven introductions to guarantee a comprehensive metabarcoding-based surveillance of NIS in recreational marinas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMicrobial ecosystems are commonly modeled by fixed interactions between species in steady exponential growth states. However, microbes often modify their environments so strongly that they are forced out of the exponential state into stressed or non-growing states. Such dynamics are typical of ecological succession in nature and serial-dilution cycles in the laboratory. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model, the Community State model, to gain insight into the dynamic coexistence of microbes due to changes in their physiological states. Our model bypasses specific interactions (e.g., nutrient starvation, stress, aggregation) that lead to different combinations of physiological states, referred to collectively as &#34;community states&#34;, and modeled by specifying the growth preference of each species along a global ecological coordinate, taken here to be the total community biomass density. We identify three key features of such dynamical communities that contrast starkly with steady-state communities: increased tolerance of community diversity to fast growth rates of species dominating different community states, enhanced community stability through staggered dominance of different species in different community states, and increased requirement on growth dominance for the inclusion of late-growing species. These features, derived explicitly for simplified models, are proposed here to be principles aiding the understanding of complex dynamical communities. Our model shifts the focus of ecosystem dynamics from bottom-up studies based on idealized inter-species interaction to top-down studies based on accessible macroscopic observables such as growth rates and total biomass density, enabling quantitative examination of community-wide characteristics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The central-marginal hypothesis predicts that genetic diversity decreases and genetic differentiation increases toward the species distribution margin. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) collected from different localities, including central and marginal populations, to test the hypothesis. The results show that the ayu populations at southern marginal habitats (Tien Yen River in Vietnam and Yakugachi River in Amami-oshima Island) displayed low genetic diversity (Haplotype diversity, H = 0.52 and 0.67; Nucleotide diversity, Pi = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively) and significantly differed from the central populations (p &lt; 0.001), consistent with the central-marginal hypothesis. However, ayu populations at the center of their distribution range (Shinano River in Honsyu and Hamoji River in Sado Island) and the northern marginal habitats (Yoichi River in Hokkaido and Aonae River in Okushiri Island) exhibited high genetic diversity (H = 1 for all rivers; Pi = 0.024-0.029). The genetic differences between the populations at the center and the northern marginal habitats were insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). This study showed that in ayu, the central-marginal hypothesis is valid in the southern direction but not in the northern direction. Urgent conservation is needed for the genetically distinct population in the degraded southern habitat with severely low genetic diversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Quantifying trade-offs within populations is an important goal in life-history and evolutionary theory. However, most studies focusing on life-history variation assume trade-offs to be static. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding life-history variation at different densities while enabling us to reveal trade-offs that are often masked due to individual heterogeneity. We use published individual-based data from a population of Soay sheep and find density dependence strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and the distribution of lifetime reproductive success. We find trade-offs between juvenile survival and growth structures life-history variation for Soay sheep at all densities, but the intensity of the trade-offs increases with population density. At carrying capacity (K), a new trade-off appears between reproduction and juvenile survival. In addition, we find the distribution of LRS to be highly constrained at K, with mothers of prime adult sizes ([~] 25kg) contributing the most to reproduction. We also find the effects of density-dependence on demographic measures such as net reproductive rate, stable size distribution, and average vital rate functions. Our results suggest high density limits the diversity of individual life history strategies and has implications for better understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics via density-dependent selection and management of ungulates in food limited environments.</p>

This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Marine resources have been important for the survival and economic development of coastal human communities across northern Europe for centuries. Knowledge of the origin of such historic resources can provide key insights into fishing practices and the spatial extent of trade networks. Here, we combine ancient DNA and stable isotopes ({delta}13C, {delta}15N, non-exchangeable {delta}2H and {delta}34S) to investigate the geographical origin of archaeological cod remains in Oslo from the eleventh to seventeenth centuries CE. Our findings provide genetic evidence that Atlantic cod was obtained from different sources, including a variety of distant-water populations like northern Norway and possibly Iceland. Evidence for such long-distance cod trade is already observed from the eleventh century, contrasting with archaeological and historical evidence from Britain and other areas of Continental Europe around the North and Baltic Seas, where such trade developed in a later period. Diverse biological origins are further supported by significant differences of a range of isotopes, indicating that multiple populations living in different environments were exploited. This research highlights the utility of combining ancient DNA methods and stable isotope analysis to describe the development of marine fisheries during the medieval and post-medieval period.</p>
