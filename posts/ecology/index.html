E.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568124\nPest insects and microbial pathogens threaten agricultural crop productivity and global forest biomes, and insect-microbe interactions can increase the severity of plant decline. Whilst bacterial chemicals have been shown to influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived chemistries on phytopathogens is barely understood. Here, we investigated beetle larvae-bacteria interactions in acute oak decline (AOD), a decline disease of oak characterised by inner bark necrosis caused by a polymicrobial consortium including Brenneria goodwinii and larval galleries of Agrilus biguttatus. To test the hypothesis that larval chemicals influence the activity of B. goodwinii, we extracted A. biguttatus larvae and tested the effect of extracts on the growth and gene expression of B. goodwinii in vitro. We demonstrate that larval chemicals elicit increased bacterial growth rate and final cell density, as well as differential expression of almost 800 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, major virulence factors in other plant pathogens. Contrastingly, gallery woody-tissue extracts induced no such effects. Our work highlights the importance of multi-kingdom interactions in plant disease and demonstrate a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens, which may be important in understanding plant diseases globally.\nA general framework for modeling pathogen transmission in co-roosting host communities\nAuthors: Simonis, M. C.; Becker, D.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568148\nCross-species transmission of pathogens can be facilitated by frequent contact among wildlife. Cross-species transmission is often driven by phylogenetic similarity between host species, but the role this plays when multiple host species co-roost is unknown. We developed a generalizable framework for understanding how cross-species transmission is driven by contact among co-roosting species spanning evolutionary similarities and the net impact on roost-level infection prevalence. We developed ordinary differential equation models describing population and infection dynamics between two and three co-roosting species. We parameterized models using co-roosting Neotropical bat systems, with interspecific transmission exponentially declining with phylogenetic distance. To assess the relative contribution of contact rates and phylogenetic similarity, we co-varied intraspecific transmission rates and phylogenetic distances while considering sensitivity to host and pathogen traits. While our models converged on similar equilibria under high intraspecific transmission or long durations of infection and immunity or latency, simulations with lower intraspecific transmission and shorter such periods revealed roost-level prevalence was greatest when hosts were most closely related. However, we identified regions of parameter space where roost-level prevalence also maximized when hosts were distantly related, driven by species-specific traits. Our generalizable models are adaptable to other co-roosting systems and informs our understanding of pathogen spillover.\nCo-habiting ants and silverfish display a converging feeding ecology\nAuthors: Parmentier, T.; Baltanas, R. M.; Valdivia, C.; Gaju-Ricart, M.; Boeckx, P.; Lukasik, P.; Wybouw, N.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567524\nO_LISpecies from a great number of animal taxa have specialized to living with social hosts. Depending on their level of specialization, these symbiotic animals are characterized by distinct behavioural, chemical, and morphological traits that enable close heterospecific interactions. Despite its functional importance, our understanding of the feeding ecology of specialized animals living with social hosts remains limited. C_LIO_LIIn this study, we examined how host specialization of silverfish co-habiting with ants affects several components of their feeding ecology. We combined stable isotope profiling, feeding assays, phylogenetic reconstruction, and microbial community characterization of the Neoasterolepisma silverfish genus and a wider nicoletiid and lepismatid silverfish panel where divergent myrmecophilous lifestyles are observed. C_LIO_LIStable isotope profiling ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) showed that the isotopic niches (proxy for trophic niches) of granivorous Messor ants and Messor-specialized Neoasterolepisma exhibit a remarkable overlap within an ant nest. Trophic experiments and gut dissections further supported that these specialized Neoasterolepisma silverfish transitioned to a diet that includes plant seeds. In contrast, the isotopic niches of generalist Neoasterolepisma silverfish and generalist nicoletiid silverfish were clearly different from their ant hosts within the shared nest environment. C_LIO_LIThe impact of the myrmecophilous lifestyle on feeding ecology was also evident in the internal silverfish microbiome. Compared to generalists, Messor-specialists exhibited a higher bacterial density and a higher proportion of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Moreover, the nest environment explained the infection profile (or the 16S rRNA genotypes) of Weissella bacteria in Messor-specialized silverfish and the ant hosts. C_LIO_LITogether, we show that social hosts are important determinants for the feeding ecology of symbiotic animals, and can induce diet convergence.

M.; Schunter, C.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567130\nOcean acidification (OA) has numerous impacts on marine organisms including behaviour. While behaviours are controlled in the neuro system, its complexity makes linking behavioural impairments to environmental change difficult. Here we use a neurological model Aplysia californica with well-studied simple neuro system and behaviours. By exposing Aplysia to current day ([~]500 {micro}atm) or near-future CO2 conditions ([~]1100 {micro}atm), we test the effect of OA on their tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) and the underlying neuromolecular response of the pleural-pedal ganglia, responsible for the behaviour. Under OA, Aplysia relax tails faster due to increased sensorin-A expression, an inhibitor of mechanosensory neurons. We further investigate how OA affects habituation, which produced a \"sensitization-like\" behaviour and affected vesicle transport and stress response, revealing an influence of OA on neuronal and behavioural outputs associated with learning. Finally, we test whether GABA-mediated neurotransmission is involved in impaired TWR, but exposure to gabazine did not restore normal behaviour and provoked little molecular response, rejecting the involvement in TWR impairment. Instead, vesicular transport and cellular signalling link other neurotransmitter processes directly with TWR impairment. Our study shows effects of OA on neurological tissue parts that control for behaviour revealing the neurological mechanisms when faced with OA.\nUsing Environmental DNA to Reconstruct Amphibian Communities at Sites Infected with Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in the Netherlands\nAuthors: Davison, A.; Spitzen-van der Sluijs, A.; O'Donnell, M.; Prasetyo, A.; Broadhurst, H.; Sales, N.; Herder, J.; Coscia, I.; McDevitt, A.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568296\nThe recently discovered Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) fungus can cause high mortality rates in some European salamanders and newts (urodelans) and has the potential to expand its currently small invasive range in Europe. Therefore, monitoring its distribution and better understanding both the species threatened and the mechanics of infection are essential in mitigating the damage Bsal may cause. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for detecting both this fungal pathogen and the amphibian communities in infected areas. We applied these methods in the province Gelderland, the Netherlands where the pathogen has previously been detected and is expanding its range, with the goal of detecting the natural amphibian community present. We sampled 27 water bodies in the region surrounding the known outbreak sites. We used data from a Bsal-specific qPCR assay to determine its presence-absence and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the amphibian communities using two different primer sets. The 12S vertebrate primer set outperformed the 16S amphibian primer set and detected all the expected amphibians in the study area: Bufo bufo, Lissotriton vulgaris, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax spp., Rana temporaria and Triturus cristatus. Bsal was detected at eight of the ponds. A distance-based redundancy analysis found a weak but significant relationship between Bsal presence and the composition of amphibian communities using eDNA. This study provides the foundation for future studies on Bsal and its relationship with amphibian communities in Europe, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms of persistence and transmission between water bodies.\nMicroeukaryote metabolism across the western North Atlantic Ocean revealed through autonomous underwater profiling\nAuthors: Cohen, N.

V.; Johnson, R.; Alexander, H.; Saito, M. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567900\nProtists (microeukaryotes) are key contributors to marine carbon cycling, influencing the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels and the vertical movement of carbon to the ocean interior. Their physiology, ecology, and interactions with the chemical environment are still poorly understood in offshore ecosystems, and especially in the deep ocean. Using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Clio, the microbial community along a 1,050 km transect in the western North Atlantic Ocean was surveyed at 10-200 m vertical depth increments to capture metabolic microeukaryote signatures spanning a gradient of oligotrophic, continental margin, and productive coastal ecosystems. Plankton biomass was collected along the surface of this transect and across depth features, and taxonomy and metabolic function were examined using a paired metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic approach. A shift in the microeukaryote community composition was observed from the euphotic zone through the mesopelagic and into the bathypelagic ocean. A diverse surface assemblage consisting of haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and ciliates was represented in both the transcript and protein fractions, with foraminifera, radiolaria, picozoa, and discoba proteins enriched at \u003e200 m depth, and fungal proteins emerging in waters \u003e3,000 m depth. In the broad microeukaryote community, nitrogen stress biomarkers were found in productive coastal sites, with phosphorus stress biomarkers in offshore waters where Saharan dust input is thought to supply iron and nitrogen. This multi-omics dataset broadens our understanding of how microeukaryotic taxa and their functional processes are structured along environmental gradients of temperature, light, macronutrients, and trace metals.\nSpatially explicit sampling frameworks to identify regions of increased mosquito abundance\nAuthors: Kemei, B.; Ochomo, E.; Ombok, M.; Midega, J.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.; Sedda, L.; McDermott, D. P.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568008\nVector control interventions often lack comprehensive information on vector population distribution and dynamics. This knowledge gap poses challenges in targeting interventions effectively, especially in areas with heterogeneous transmission and where complementary vector control tools may be required to achieve sustained impact on disease transmission. In this study, we implemented a spatially explicit sampling framework for improved vector surveillance in coastal Kenya. Our stratified lattice with close pair sampling design aimed to characterise the vector dynamics of the primary malaria-transmitting species in the area and assess the ecotype classifications effectiveness at identifying clear population patterns. The study collected 3,621 mosquitoes, with An. funestus s.l. being the most abundant malaria vector. The inclusion of the ecotype classification significantly improved spatial abundance model estimates for An. gambiae and Culex spp. Wetlands, topographic wetness index, and proximity to rivers were associated with increased mosquito abundance. Spatial modelling revealed high abundance regions near the Galana-Sabaki River. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a reproducible spatial sampling approach to identify areas with high vector abundance and inform targeted vector control strategies. The study highlights the importance of ecological stratification and a spatial explicit sampling approach for predicting mosquito presence when prior data is limited and underscores the potential for refining future sampling for control efforts.\nFlower visitor groups show differential responses to individual and plot-level chemodiversity with consequences for plant fitness\nAuthors: Sasidharan, R.; Grond, S. G.; Champion, S.; Eilers, E. J.; Mueller, C.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568056\nO_LIChemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood. C_LIO_LIThis study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined. C_LIO_LIOur findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type. C_LIO_LISynthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.

Despite the taxonomists and ecologists attempts to elucidate the mechanisms behind plant gall formation, its understanding is still incomplete. Modern genetic techniques allow in depth analysis of the molecular processes, but variations across species entangle the analysis. Establishing laboratory-friendly plant-gall inducer communities is crucial, yet past attempts have faced challenges. C_LIO_LIOur study aimed to create a sustainable laboratory community involving wild roses (Rosa sp.) and as gall-inducing insects rose gall wasps belonging to the genus Diplolepis. Controlled indoor conditions were optimized for plant growth. Wild roses were transplanted, then exposed to gall inducers, and monitored. C_LIO_LISuccessfully initialized gall growth was measures and analysed, revealing insights into the impact of plant vigour on gall size. C_LIO_LIOur study successfully established a novel laboratory community for further research on gall formation mechanisms. C_LI\nInvasive traits of freshwater fish database (ITOFF)\nAuthors: Jessop, A.; Michalopoulou, A.; Coonan, C.; Mazzei, L.; Sutherland O'Brien, E.; Brady, G.; Davison, C.; Gourlay, W.; Henderson, E.; Lornie, A.; McCloskey, E.; Ramsay, H.; Wilson, S.; Shimadzu, H.; Barbosa, M.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567195\nAIMSpecies invasions are a major driver of global biodiversity loss, but only a minority of invasions are successful. Evidence suggests that invasive success is linked to life-history traits. Yet, data on invasive success and species traits remain fragmented across multiple sources. Here we present the Invasive Traits of Freshwater Fish (ITOFF) database, an interdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple datasets to elucidate the role of life-history traits in shaping invasive success. ITOFF allows seamless access to invasive species data and fosters collaborative actions through knowledge sharing. ITOFF is supported by an innovative web-application that makes complex relationships between invasive and native species accessible to a broad audience. The scientific contribution of ITOFF is illustrated by examining the role of life-history traits and phylogeny in invasion success. LOCATIONGlobal. METHODSGeneralized linear models were used to test the contribution of generation time, trophic level, longevity, and temperature range to invasive success. Through divisive cluster analysis we investigate the role of multiple traits in determining invasive success. Finally, we construct phylogenetic trees to investigate the role of evolutionary history in the invasion process. RESULTSITOFF unifies data for 1917 freshwater fish species representative of invasive species, those species they endanger, and species impacted by invasives but not considered endangered. Invasive species are generally characterized by greater temperature ranges, but are indistinguishable from impacted, endangered, and critically endangered species for the remaining life-history traits. Further, we show that invasive species are generally not distinct from impacted or endangered species when considering multiple traits or phylogeny. MAIN CONCLUSIONSITOFF provides an accessible platform for the improved forecasting of species invasions. ITOFF data shows that classical predictions of life-history traits determining invasive success do not hold amongst freshwater fish species. Forecasting of invasive species must therefore shift towards a wholistic approach encompassing the species and the environment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Pest insects and microbial pathogens threaten agricultural crop productivity and global forest biomes, and insect-microbe interactions can increase the severity of plant decline. Whilst bacterial chemicals have been shown to influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived chemistries on phytopathogens is barely understood. Here, we investigated beetle larvae-bacteria interactions in acute oak decline (AOD), a decline disease of oak characterised by inner bark necrosis caused by a polymicrobial consortium including Brenneria goodwinii and larval galleries of Agrilus biguttatus. To test the hypothesis that larval chemicals influence the activity of B. goodwinii, we extracted A. biguttatus larvae and tested the effect of extracts on the growth and gene expression of B. goodwinii in vitro. We demonstrate that larval chemicals elicit increased bacterial growth rate and final cell density, as well as differential expression of almost 800 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, major virulence factors in other plant pathogens. Contrastingly, gallery woody-tissue extracts induced no such effects. Our work highlights the importance of multi-kingdom interactions in plant disease and demonstrate a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens, which may be important in understanding plant diseases globally.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cross-species transmission of pathogens can be facilitated by frequent contact among wildlife. Cross-species transmission is often driven by phylogenetic similarity between host species, but the role this plays when multiple host species co-roost is unknown. We developed a generalizable framework for understanding how cross-species transmission is driven by contact among co-roosting species spanning evolutionary similarities and the net impact on roost-level infection prevalence. We developed ordinary differential equation models describing population and infection dynamics between two and three co-roosting species. We parameterized models using co-roosting Neotropical bat systems, with interspecific transmission exponentially declining with phylogenetic distance. To assess the relative contribution of contact rates and phylogenetic similarity, we co-varied intraspecific transmission rates and phylogenetic distances while considering sensitivity to host and pathogen traits. While our models converged on similar equilibria under high intraspecific transmission or long durations of infection and immunity or latency, simulations with lower intraspecific transmission and shorter such periods revealed roost-level prevalence was greatest when hosts were most closely related. However, we identified regions of parameter space where roost-level prevalence also maximized when hosts were distantly related, driven by species-specific traits. Our generalizable models are adaptable to other co-roosting systems and informs our understanding of pathogen spillover.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LISpecies from a great number of animal taxa have specialized to living with social hosts. Depending on their level of specialization, these symbiotic animals are characterized by distinct behavioural, chemical, and morphological traits that enable close heterospecific interactions. Despite its functional importance, our understanding of the feeding ecology of specialized animals living with social hosts remains limited.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we examined how host specialization of silverfish co-habiting with ants affects several components of their feeding ecology. We combined stable isotope profiling, feeding assays, phylogenetic reconstruction, and microbial community characterization of the Neoasterolepisma silverfish genus and a wider nicoletiid and lepismatid silverfish panel where divergent myrmecophilous lifestyles are observed.
C_LIO_LIStable isotope profiling ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) showed that the isotopic niches (proxy for trophic niches) of granivorous Messor ants and Messor-specialized Neoasterolepisma exhibit a remarkable overlap within an ant nest. Trophic experiments and gut dissections further supported that these specialized Neoasterolepisma silverfish transitioned to a diet that includes plant seeds. In contrast, the isotopic niches of generalist Neoasterolepisma silverfish and generalist nicoletiid silverfish were clearly different from their ant hosts within the shared nest environment.
C_LIO_LIThe impact of the myrmecophilous lifestyle on feeding ecology was also evident in the internal silverfish microbiome. Compared to generalists, Messor-specialists exhibited a higher bacterial density and a higher proportion of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Moreover, the nest environment explained the infection profile (or the 16S rRNA genotypes) of Weissella bacteria in Messor-specialized silverfish and the ant hosts.
C_LIO_LITogether, we show that social hosts are important determinants for the feeding ecology of symbiotic animals, and can induce diet convergence.

        <p class="abstract">Ocean acidification (OA) has numerous impacts on marine organisms including behaviour. While behaviours are controlled in the neuro system, its complexity makes linking behavioural impairments to environmental change difficult. Here we use a neurological model Aplysia californica with well-studied simple neuro system and behaviours. By exposing Aplysia to current day ([~]500 {micro}atm) or near-future CO2 conditions ([~]1100 {micro}atm), we test the effect of OA on their tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) and the underlying neuromolecular response of the pleural-pedal ganglia, responsible for the behaviour. Under OA, Aplysia relax tails faster due to increased sensorin-A expression, an inhibitor of mechanosensory neurons. We further investigate how OA affects habituation, which produced a &#34;sensitization-like&#34; behaviour and affected vesicle transport and stress response, revealing an influence of OA on neuronal and behavioural outputs associated with learning. Finally, we test whether GABA-mediated neurotransmission is involved in impaired TWR, but exposure to gabazine did not restore normal behaviour and provoked little molecular response, rejecting the involvement in TWR impairment. Instead, vesicular transport and cellular signalling link other neurotransmitter processes directly with TWR impairment. Our study shows effects of OA on neurological tissue parts that control for behaviour revealing the neurological mechanisms when faced with OA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recently discovered Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) fungus can cause high mortality rates in some European salamanders and newts (urodelans) and has the potential to expand its currently small invasive range in Europe. Therefore, monitoring its distribution and better understanding both the species threatened and the mechanics of infection are essential in mitigating the damage Bsal may cause. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for detecting both this fungal pathogen and the amphibian communities in infected areas. We applied these methods in the province Gelderland, the Netherlands where the pathogen has previously been detected and is expanding its range, with the goal of detecting the natural amphibian community present. We sampled 27 water bodies in the region surrounding the known outbreak sites. We used data from a Bsal-specific qPCR assay to determine its presence-absence and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the amphibian communities using two different primer sets. The 12S vertebrate primer set outperformed the 16S amphibian primer set and detected all the expected amphibians in the study area: Bufo bufo, Lissotriton vulgaris, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax spp., Rana temporaria and Triturus cristatus. Bsal was detected at eight of the ponds. A distance-based redundancy analysis found a weak but significant relationship between Bsal presence and the composition of amphibian communities using eDNA. This study provides the foundation for future studies on Bsal and its relationship with amphibian communities in Europe, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms of persistence and transmission between water bodies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protists (microeukaryotes) are key contributors to marine carbon cycling, influencing the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels and the vertical movement of carbon to the ocean interior. Their physiology, ecology, and interactions with the chemical environment are still poorly understood in offshore ecosystems, and especially in the deep ocean. Using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Clio, the microbial community along a 1,050 km transect in the western North Atlantic Ocean was surveyed at 10-200 m vertical depth increments to capture metabolic microeukaryote signatures spanning a gradient of oligotrophic, continental margin, and productive coastal ecosystems. Plankton biomass was collected along the surface of this transect and across depth features, and taxonomy and metabolic function were examined using a paired metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic approach. A shift in the microeukaryote community composition was observed from the euphotic zone through the mesopelagic and into the bathypelagic ocean. A diverse surface assemblage consisting of haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and ciliates was represented in both the transcript and protein fractions, with foraminifera, radiolaria, picozoa, and discoba proteins enriched at &gt;200 m depth, and fungal proteins emerging in waters &gt;3,000 m depth. In the broad microeukaryote community, nitrogen stress biomarkers were found in productive coastal sites, with phosphorus stress biomarkers in offshore waters where Saharan dust input is thought to supply iron and nitrogen. This multi-omics dataset broadens our understanding of how microeukaryotic taxa and their functional processes are structured along environmental gradients of temperature, light, macronutrients, and trace metals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vector control interventions often lack comprehensive information on vector population distribution and dynamics. This knowledge gap poses challenges in targeting interventions effectively, especially in areas with heterogeneous transmission and where complementary vector control tools may be required to achieve sustained impact on disease transmission. In this study, we implemented a spatially explicit sampling framework for improved vector surveillance in coastal Kenya. Our stratified lattice with close pair sampling design aimed to characterise the vector dynamics of the primary malaria-transmitting species in the area and assess the ecotype classifications effectiveness at identifying clear population patterns. The study collected 3,621 mosquitoes, with An. funestus s.l. being the most abundant malaria vector. The inclusion of the ecotype classification significantly improved spatial abundance model estimates for An. gambiae and Culex spp. Wetlands, topographic wetness index, and proximity to rivers were associated with increased mosquito abundance. Spatial modelling revealed high abundance regions near the Galana-Sabaki River. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a reproducible spatial sampling approach to identify areas with high vector abundance and inform targeted vector control strategies. The study highlights the importance of ecological stratification and a spatial explicit sampling approach for predicting mosquito presence when prior data is limited and underscores the potential for refining future sampling for control efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIChemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood.
C_LIO_LIThis study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined.
C_LIO_LIOur findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type.
C_LIO_LISynthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.

        <p class="abstract">O_LIPlant galls are unique outgrowths caused by various organisms, including insects, serving as nourishment for the inducers larvae. Despite the taxonomists and ecologists attempts to elucidate the mechanisms behind plant gall formation, its understanding is still incomplete. Modern genetic techniques allow in depth analysis of the molecular processes, but variations across species entangle the analysis. Establishing laboratory-friendly plant-gall inducer communities is crucial, yet past attempts have faced challenges.
C_LIO_LIOur study aimed to create a sustainable laboratory community involving wild roses (Rosa sp.) and as gall-inducing insects rose gall wasps belonging to the genus Diplolepis. Controlled indoor conditions were optimized for plant growth. Wild roses were transplanted, then exposed to gall inducers, and monitored.
C_LIO_LISuccessfully initialized gall growth was measures and analysed, revealing insights into the impact of plant vigour on gall size.
C_LIO_LIOur study successfully established a novel laboratory community for further research on gall formation mechanisms.

        <p class="abstract">AIMSpecies invasions are a major driver of global biodiversity loss, but only a minority of invasions are successful. Evidence suggests that invasive success is linked to life-history traits. Yet, data on invasive success and species traits remain fragmented across multiple sources. Here we present the Invasive Traits of Freshwater Fish (ITOFF) database, an interdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple datasets to elucidate the role of life-history traits in shaping invasive success. ITOFF allows seamless access to invasive species data and fosters collaborative actions through knowledge sharing. ITOFF is supported by an innovative web-application that makes complex relationships between invasive and native species accessible to a broad audience. The scientific contribution of ITOFF is illustrated by examining the role of life-history traits and phylogeny in invasion success.

LOCATIONGlobal.

METHODSGeneralized linear models were used to test the contribution of generation time, trophic level, longevity, and temperature range to invasive success. Through divisive cluster analysis we investigate the role of multiple traits in determining invasive success. Finally, we construct phylogenetic trees to investigate the role of evolutionary history in the invasion process.

RESULTSITOFF unifies data for 1917 freshwater fish species representative of invasive species, those species they endanger, and species impacted by invasives but not considered endangered. Invasive species are generally characterized by greater temperature ranges, but are indistinguishable from impacted, endangered, and critically endangered species for the remaining life-history traits. Further, we show that invasive species are generally not distinct from impacted or endangered species when considering multiple traits or phylogeny.

MAIN CONCLUSIONSITOFF provides an accessible platform for the improved forecasting of species invasions. ITOFF data shows that classical predictions of life-history traits determining invasive success do not hold amongst freshwater fish species. Forecasting of invasive species must therefore shift towards a wholistic approach encompassing the species and the environment.</p>
