A.; Haddad, N.; Ries, L.\nScore: 48.7, Published: 2023-08-26 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.29.502042\nMounting evidence shows insects are in decline globally. Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research. One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.\nPeriodic shifts in viral load increase risk of spillover from bats\nAuthors: Lunn, T. J.; Borremans, B.; Jones, D. N.; Kessler, M. K.; Dale, A. S.; Yinda, K. C.; Ruiz-Aravena, M.; Falvo, C. A.; Crowley, D.; Lloyd-Smith, J. O.; Munster, V. J.; Eby, P.; McCallum, H.; Hudson, P.; Restif, O.; McGuire, L. P.; Smith, I. L.; Bat One Health Group, ; Plowright, R. K.; Peel, A. J.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556454\nPrediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.\nThe demographic history of the wild crop relative Brachypodium distachyon is shaped by distinct past and present ecological niches.\nAuthors: Minadakis, N.; Williams, H.; Horvath, R.; Cakovic, D.; Stritt, C.; Thieme, M.; Bourgeois, Y. X. C.; Roulin, A.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543285\nClosely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.\nA taxonomy of multiple stable states in complex ecological communities\nAuthors: Aguade-Gorgorio, G.; Arnoldi, J.-F.; Barbier, M.; Kefi, S.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555051\nMany natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.\nMethods for tagging an ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis\nAuthors: Folk, A.; Mennerat, A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555695\nMonitoring individuals within populations is a cornerstone in evolutionary ecology, yet individual tracking of invertebrates and particularly parasitic organisms remains rare. To address this gap, we describe here a method for attaching radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to individual adult females of a marine ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Comparing two alternative types of glue, we found that one of them (2-octyl cyanoacrylate, 2oc) gave a significantly higher tag retention rate than the other (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, e2c). This glue comparison test also resulted in a higher loss rate of adult ectoparasites from the population where tagging was done using 2oc, but this included males not tagged and thus could also suggest a mere tank effect. Corroborating this, a more extensive analysis using data collected over two years showed no significant difference in mortality after repeated exposure to the 2oc glue, nor did it show any significant effect of the tagging procedure on the reproduction of female salmon lice. The RFID tags were lost linearly over time, with the percentage of the living female population that retained their original tags declining by 0.28 percent.day-1. In other words, tag retention was in general high, with a typical projected retention of about 89% after 30 days or 80% after 60 days, although one of the four batches of glue used, purchased from a different supplier, appeared to give significantly lower tag retention and with greater initial loss (70% and 53% respectively). Overall, we find that RFID tagging is a simple and effective technology that enables documenting individual life histories for invertebrates of a suitable size, including marine and parasitic species, and that it can be used over long periods of study.\nEffects of forest urbanization on the interplay between small mammal communities and their gut microbiota\nAuthors: Bouilloud, M.; Galan, M.; Pradel, J.; Loiseau, A.; FERRERO, J.; Gallet, R.; Roche, B.; Charbonnel, N.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556680\nUrbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.\nAssessing the links between pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic features of plant species with contrasting distribution ranges\nAuthors: Valverde, J.; Medrano, M.; Herrera, C. M.; Alonso, C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556048\nIn flowering plants, pollinators contribute to gene flow while they also respond to variation in plant traits together determined by genetic, epigenetic and environmental sources of variation. Consequently, a correlation between abundance and diversity of pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of plant populations such as diversity or distinctiveness is to be expected, yet no study has explored such long-term dimensions of plant-pollinator interactions. Mediterranean narrow endemics often exhibit unexpectedly high levels of population (epi)genetic diversity. We hypothesize that pollinators may contribute to explain this pattern. Specifically, we expect a stronger association of pollinators with population (epi)genetic variability in narrow endemics than in widely distributed congeners. We studied five pairs of congeneric plant species, consisting of one narrow endemic with a restricted distribution and one widespread congener, found in the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (SE Spain). In up to three populations per species, a comprehensive characterisation of pollinators was carried out to estimate pollinator diversity and visitation rate. Genetic and epigenetic diversity and distinctiveness of each population was calculated using AFLP markers and methylation-sensitive AFLP markers (MSAP) respectively. The relationships with pollinator diversity and visitation rate were assessed. The diversity of pollinators did not vary according to the plant distribution range, whereas visitation rate was higher in widespread species. As predicted, only narrow endemics showed a significant association between pollinators and their population genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Specifically, higher pollinator diversity and visitation rates entailed higher population genetic diversity and lower epigenetic distinctiveness. This work shows the value of exploring the relationships between pollinator abundance and diversity and population (epi)genetics for understanding the evolution of plant rarity.\nMulti-Generation Selection of Rhizosphere Ecosystem Associated with Plant Genotype and Biomass in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Shankar, N.; Shetty, P.; Kesseli, R.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556126\nThe role of the microbiome in shaping the host phenotype has emerged as a critical area of investigation, with implications in ecology, evolution, and host health. The complex and dynamic interactions involving plants and their diverse rhizosphere microbial communities are influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to soil type, environment, and plant genotype. Understanding the impact of these factors on microbial community assembly is key to yielding host-specific and robust benefits for plants, yet remains challenging. Here we ran an artificial ecosystem selection experiment, over eight generations, in Arabidopsis thaliana Ler and Cvi to select soil microbiomes associated with higher or lower biomass of the host. This resulted in divergent microbial communities, shaped by a complex interplay between random environmental variations, plant genotypes, and biomass selection pressures. In the initial phases of the experiment, the genotype and the biomass selection treatment have modest but significant impacts. Over time, the plant genotype and biomass treatments gain more influence, explaining ~40% of the variation in the microbial community composition. Furthermore, a genotype-specific association of plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial taxa, Labraceae with Ler and Rhizobiaceae with Cvi, is observed under selection for high biomass. This study enhances our understanding of both microbial community dynamics and plant genetics and can be applied to agricultural settings to improve plant growth and soil restoration.\nHeat stress and the temporal dynamics of insect growth\nAuthors: Kingsolver, J. G.; Shlichta, J. G.; Moore, M. E.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.553041\nTemperature affects rates of ingestion, growth and other key processes in insects and other ectotherms, a relationship described by the thermal performance curve. But the history of temperature exposure can cause stress or acclimation responses, altering the relationship between current temperature and performance. The temporal dynamics of such time-dependent effects for ectotherm growth are poorly understood. We quantify how growth and ingestion change over time at different constant temperatures during the final larval instar for two thermal-generalist insect species, Pieris rapae L. and Manduca sexta L. Initial growth rates were greatest at higher temperatures for both P. rapae (29-35 C) and M. sexta (34-38 C); but growth rates at higher temperatures declined over time. As a result, the optimal and maximal temperatures for growth declined over time (2-4 days) in both species. Unlike P. rapae, M. sexta could maintain growth and survival to wandering and pupation at temperatures above 35 C. For M. sexta larvae at 40 C, ingestion continues even as growth declines, suggesting that post-ingestive processes limit growth rates at these high temperatures. Our results show how time-dependent effects at higher temperatures develop over hourly to daily time scales, with important consequences for understanding and modeling organismal responses to heat waves and extreme temperature events.\nDietary 14C reservoir effects and the chronology of prehistoric burials at Sakhtysh, central European Russia\nAuthors: Meadows, J.; Khramtsova, A.; Kostyleva, E.; Vasilyev, S.; Veselovskaya, E.; Dobrovolskaya, M.; da Silva, N. A.; Krause-Kyora, B.; Piezonka, H.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.555011\nWe present the first robust radiocarbon (14C) chronology for prehistoric burial activity at Sakhtysh, in European Russia, where nearly 180 inhumations attributed to Lyalovo and Volosovo pottery-using hunter-gatherer-fishers represent the largest known mortuary populations of these groups. Past attempts at 14C dating were restricted by poor preservation and limited understanding of diet and dietary 14C reservoir effects (DREs). We obtained 32 new AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) 14C dates on human petrous bones. Dietary stable isotopes ({delta}13C, {delta}15N) for all AMS-dated human samples allow us to propose a novel DRE correction model, using differences in 14C, {delta}13C and {delta}15N from bones and teeth of the same individuals to predict DREs of up to c.900 14C years. Our chronological model for 40 individuals dates Lyalovo burials to the early 5th millennium cal BC, and Volosovo burials to the mid-4th to early 3rd millennium. It reveals a previously unrecognised shift in the Volosovo subsistence economy at c.3300 cal BC, coinciding with a reorientation of trade networks, and shows that the last burial at Sakhtysh was the only one in a crouched position, which coincided with the beginning of Fatyanovo practices, the regional expression of the Yamnaya/Corded Ware expansion.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mounting evidence shows insects are in decline globally. Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research.

One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Closely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring individuals within populations is a cornerstone in evolutionary ecology, yet individual tracking of invertebrates and particularly parasitic organisms remains rare. To address this gap, we describe here a method for attaching radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to individual adult females of a marine ectoparasite, the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Comparing two alternative types of glue, we found that one of them (2-octyl cyanoacrylate, 2oc) gave a significantly higher tag retention rate than the other (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, e2c). This glue comparison test also resulted in a higher loss rate of adult ectoparasites from the population where tagging was done using 2oc, but this included males not tagged and thus could also suggest a mere tank effect. Corroborating this, a more extensive analysis using data collected over two years showed no significant difference in mortality after repeated exposure to the 2oc glue, nor did it show any significant effect of the tagging procedure on the reproduction of female salmon lice. The RFID tags were lost linearly over time, with the percentage of the living female population that retained their original tags declining by 0.28 percent.day-1. In other words, tag retention was in general high, with a typical projected retention of about 89% after 30 days or 80% after 60 days, although one of the four batches of glue used, purchased from a different supplier, appeared to give significantly lower tag retention and with greater initial loss (70% and 53% respectively). Overall, we find that RFID tagging is a simple and effective technology that enables documenting individual life histories for invertebrates of a suitable size, including marine and parasitic species, and that it can be used over long periods of study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In flowering plants, pollinators contribute to gene flow while they also respond to variation in plant traits together determined by genetic, epigenetic and environmental sources of variation. Consequently, a correlation between abundance and diversity of pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of plant populations such as diversity or distinctiveness is to be expected, yet no study has explored such long-term dimensions of plant-pollinator interactions. Mediterranean narrow endemics often exhibit unexpectedly high levels of population (epi)genetic diversity. We hypothesize that pollinators may contribute to explain this pattern. Specifically, we expect a stronger association of pollinators with population (epi)genetic variability in narrow endemics than in widely distributed congeners. We studied five pairs of congeneric plant species, consisting of one narrow endemic with a restricted distribution and one widespread congener, found in the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (SE Spain). In up to three populations per species, a comprehensive characterisation of pollinators was carried out to estimate pollinator diversity and visitation rate. Genetic and epigenetic diversity and distinctiveness of each population was calculated using AFLP markers and methylation-sensitive AFLP markers (MSAP) respectively. The relationships with pollinator diversity and visitation rate were assessed. The diversity of pollinators did not vary according to the plant distribution range, whereas visitation rate was higher in widespread species. As predicted, only narrow endemics showed a significant association between pollinators and their population genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Specifically, higher pollinator diversity and visitation rates entailed higher population genetic diversity and lower epigenetic distinctiveness. This work shows the value of exploring the relationships between pollinator abundance and diversity and population (epi)genetics for understanding the evolution of plant rarity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of the microbiome in shaping the host phenotype has emerged as a critical area of investigation, with implications in ecology, evolution, and host health. The complex and dynamic interactions involving plants and their diverse rhizosphere microbial communities are influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to soil type, environment, and plant genotype. Understanding the impact of these factors on microbial community assembly is key to yielding host-specific and robust benefits for plants, yet remains challenging. Here we ran an artificial ecosystem selection experiment, over eight generations, in Arabidopsis thaliana Ler and Cvi to select soil microbiomes associated with higher or lower biomass of the host. This resulted in divergent microbial communities, shaped by a complex interplay between random environmental variations, plant genotypes, and biomass selection pressures. In the initial phases of the experiment, the genotype and the biomass selection treatment have modest but significant impacts. Over time, the plant genotype and biomass treatments gain more influence, explaining ~40% of the variation in the microbial community composition. Furthermore, a genotype-specific association of plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial taxa, Labraceae with Ler and Rhizobiaceae with Cvi, is observed under selection for high biomass. This study enhances our understanding of both microbial community dynamics and plant genetics and can be applied to agricultural settings to improve plant growth and soil restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Temperature affects rates of ingestion, growth and other key processes in insects and other ectotherms, a relationship described by the thermal performance curve. But the history of temperature exposure can cause stress or acclimation responses, altering the relationship between current temperature and performance. The temporal dynamics of such time-dependent effects for ectotherm growth are poorly understood. We quantify how growth and ingestion change over time at different constant temperatures during the final larval instar for two thermal-generalist insect species, Pieris rapae L. and Manduca sexta L. Initial growth rates were greatest at higher temperatures for both P. rapae (29-35 C) and M. sexta (34-38 C); but growth rates at higher temperatures declined over time. As a result, the optimal and maximal temperatures for growth declined over time (2-4 days) in both species. Unlike P. rapae, M. sexta could maintain growth and survival to wandering and pupation at temperatures above 35 C. For M. sexta larvae at 40 C, ingestion continues even as growth declines, suggesting that post-ingestive processes limit growth rates at these high temperatures. Our results show how time-dependent effects at higher temperatures develop over hourly to daily time scales, with important consequences for understanding and modeling organismal responses to heat waves and extreme temperature events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present the first robust radiocarbon (14C) chronology for prehistoric burial activity at Sakhtysh, in European Russia, where nearly 180 inhumations attributed to Lyalovo and Volosovo pottery-using hunter-gatherer-fishers represent the largest known mortuary populations of these groups. Past attempts at 14C dating were restricted by poor preservation and limited understanding of diet and dietary 14C reservoir effects (DREs). We obtained 32 new AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) 14C dates on human petrous bones. Dietary stable isotopes ({delta}13C, {delta}15N) for all AMS-dated human samples allow us to propose a novel DRE correction model, using differences in 14C, {delta}13C and {delta}15N from bones and teeth of the same individuals to predict DREs of up to c.900 14C years. Our chronological model for 40 individuals dates Lyalovo burials to the early 5th millennium cal BC, and Volosovo burials to the mid-4th to early 3rd millennium. It reveals a previously unrecognised shift in the Volosovo subsistence economy at c.3300 cal BC, coinciding with a reorientation of trade networks, and shows that the last burial at Sakhtysh was the only one in a crouched position, which coincided with the beginning of Fatyanovo practices, the regional expression of the Yamnaya/Corded Ware expansion.</p>
