J.; Gibbons, S. M.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552554\nPrior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.\nSocial responses to a hurricane drive greater epidemic risk\nAuthors: Motes-Rodrigo, A.; Albery, G. F.; Negron-Del Valle, J.; Philips, D.; Cayo Biobank Research Unit, ; Platt, M.; Brent, L. J.; Testard, C.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549341\nThe increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change has the potential to alter ecosystem dynamics and wildlife health. Here we show that increasing social connections in response to a hurricane enhanced disease transmission risk for years after the event in a population of rhesus macaques. Our findings reveal that behavioural responses to natural disasters can elevate epidemic risk, thereby threatening wildlife health, population viability, and spillover to humans.\nSimulating animal space use from fitted integrated Step-Selection Functions (iSSF)\nAuthors: Signer, J.; Fieberg, J.; Reineking, B.; Schlaegel, U.; Smith, B. J.; Balkenhol, N.; Avgar, T.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552754\n1. A standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data. 2. Integrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths. 3. Here, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package). 4. We demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity.\nA trait-based understanding of the vulnerability of a paleotropical moth community to predation by a sympatric bat with flexible foraging strategies\nAuthors: Dey, P.; Balakrishnan, R.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552891\nPrey profitability for a predator hunting diverse prey varies with species and seasons. Whereas prey selection by aerial-hawking or gleaning bats is well established, this is challenging to establish in species that adopt both these strategies flexibly. Measurable prey traits coupled with availability in the foraging grounds help characterize the vulnerability of prey species to predation. In the Western Ghats of India, a global biodiversity hotspot, we studied an anthropogenic landscape, where insectivorous bats are abundant and diverse, but their impact on moth communities is little understood. We investigated the morphological traits of a sympatric moth community that make them more vulnerable to predation by Megaderma spasma, a bat with flexible foraging strategies. We also established the seasonal composition of moth prey in the diet of the bat. We analyzed the discarded prey remains from several roosts, collected over three years, for seasonal patterns in the diet and selective hunting. Through light-trapping, we collected moth specimens in different seasons to assess the morphological traits of the moth community available in the foraging area of the bat. The traits likely to affect the profitability of prey moths were measured: forewing length, hindwing length, wingspan, and body length (a proxy for body size); forewing area, hindwing area, maneuverability, and wing loading (as a proxy for evasive flight capability), and forewing aspect ratio (as a proxy for wing shape). Our results showed that consumed moth prey diversity varies seasonally, with moths belonging to the Hepialidae family being preferred in the wet season. Moths belonging to the Sphingidae family were the most abundant in the diet, followed by Erebidae and Hepialidae. Sphingid moths have the lowest maneuverability, and highest forewing aspect ratio; the Hepialidae moths have the maximum body size followed by Sphingids thus confirming our hypothesis that larger moths with low evasive capabilities are more vulnerable to predation. Assessing vulnerability at the prey community level, we establish a framework for future research on moth-bat interactions from the diverse and less-explored paleotropical communities. Additionally, the study reiterates the usefulness of trait-based approaches to understanding prey-predator dynamics.\nLocal climate change velocities explain multidirectional range shifts in a North American butterfly assemblage\nAuthors: da Silva, C. R. B.; Diamond, S. E.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551397\nSpecies are often expected to shift their distributions poleward to evade warming climates. However, from 18 years of fixed transect monitoring data on 88 species of butterfly in the midwestern United States, we show that butterflies are shifting their centroids in all directions, except towards regions that are becoming warmer. Butterflies shifted their centroids at a mean rate of 4.87 km yr-1. The rate of centroid shift was significantly associated with local climate change velocity (temperature and precipitation), but not with mean climate change velocity throughout the species ranges. Surprisingly, the centroid shift was also unrelated to species traits expected to mediate the shift response including thermal niche breadth (range of climates butterflies experience throughout their distribution) and wingspan (often used as metric for dispersal capability). Contrasting with a number of previous studies, we observed relatively high phylogenetic signal in the rate and direction species shifted their centroids, suggesting that evolutionary history helps to explain multidirectional range shift responses and that some groups of species will be better able to shift their ranges than others. This research shows important signatures of multidirectional range shifts (latitudinal and longitudinal) and uniquely shows that local climate change velocities are more important in driving range shifts than the mean climate change velocity throughout a species entire range.\nUnveiling nesting strategies: Investigating visual concealment and nest-site selection in Yellow-wattled Lapwings, Vanellus malabaricus (Boddaert, 1783)\nAuthors: Jagati, V.; Ramaswami, G.; Datta-Roy, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.13.552636\nGround-nesting birds such as Yellow-wattled Lapwing Vanellus malabaricus (Boddaert, 1783) employ several nesting and behavioral strategies to mitigate nest predation, which greatly influences their reproductive success and survival. Yet the breeding ecology of Yellow-wattled Lapwing has received relatively little research attention despite the species' widespread presence in the Indian subcontinent. The objective of this study was to investigate the significance and impact of two visual concealment strategies commonly utilized by open ground-nesting birds: visual concealment through vegetative characteristics and camouflage using Yellow-wattled Lapwing as the model organism. We also assessed the nest-site selection of Yellow-wattled Lapwings in relation to vegetation cover and food availability, as well as their choice of nest substrate by using behavioral sampling, quadrat sampling, and digital image analysis techniques. We found that variation in hatching success could not be attributed to the analyzed camouflage mechanisms (disruptive markings and pattern complexity matching). Furthermore, the nesting pairs exhibited a preference for areas with high vegetation cover and low food availability while selecting nesting sites. We also showed that this species might exhibit an active behavioral preference for selecting nest substrates. It is important to note that this study was conducted during a single nesting season for the Yellow-wattled Lapwings, and further temporal replicates are necessary to validate and establish the findings over the long term.\nModeling individual variability in habitat selection and movement using integrated step-selection analyses\nAuthors: Chatterjee, N.; Wolfson, D.; Kim, D.; Gomez, J. V.; Freeman, S.; Bacheler, N. M.; Shertzer, K.; Taylor, C.; Fieberg, J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551213\nO_LIIntegrated step-selection analyses (ISSAs) are frequently used to study animal movement and habitat selection. Methods for incorporating random effects in ISSAs have been developed, making it possible to quantify variability among animals in their space-use patterns. Although it is possible to model variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters, applications to date have focused on the former despite the widely acknowledged and important role that movement plays in determining ecological processes from the individual to ecosystem level. One potential explanation for this omission is the absence of readily-available software or examples demonstrating methods for estimating movement parameters in ISSAs with random effects. C_LIO_LITo demonstrate methods for characterizing among-individual variability in both movement and habitatselection parameters, we fit two models to an acoustic telemetry data set involving locations of 35 red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). In the first model, the distribution of snapper step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a categorical habitat variable indicating the type of benthic reef habitat the fish was located in at the start of the movement step. In the second model, step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a continuous variable measuring the distance between the fishs current location and nearest edge habitat. In both models, we also quantified habitat selection for different benthic habitat classes and distance to edge habitat at the end of the movement step. C_LIO_LIThere was substantial among-individual variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters. Nonetheless, most red snapper selected for high-relief hardbottom habitat and for locations nearer to edge habitat. They also moved less when in high-relief hardbottom habitat or when they were close to reef edges. Turn angles were frequently near {+/-} {pi}, but were more dispersed when fish were far away from edge habitat. C_LIO_LIWe provide code templates and functions for quantifying variability in movement and habitat-selection parameters when implementing ISSAs with random effects. In doing so, we hope to encourage ecologists conducting ISSAs to take full advantage of their ability to model among-individual variability in both habitat-selection and movement patterns.

G.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551142\nTo conserve biodiversity, it is imperative to maintain and restore sufficient amounts of functional habitat networks. Hence, locating remaining forests with natural structures and processes over landscapes and large regions is a key task. We integrated machine learning (Random Forest) and open landscape data to scan all forest landscapes in Sweden with a 1 ha spatial resolution with respect to the relative likelihood of hosting High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF). Using independent spatial stand-and plot-level validation data we confirmed that our predictions (ROC AUC in the range of 0.89 - 0.90) correctly represent forests with different levels of naturalness, from deteriorated to those with high and associated biodiversity conservation values. Given ambitious national and international conservation objectives, and increasingly intensive forestry, our model and the resulting wall-to-wall mapping fills an urgent gap for assessing fulfilment of evidence-based conservation targets, spatial planning, and designing forest landscape restoration.\nMHC-B Diversity and Signs of Respiratory Illness in Wild, East African Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii)\nAuthors: Phillips, S. R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551731\nMany traits, intrinsic and extrinsic to an organism, contribute to interindividual variation in immunity in wild habitats. The vertebrate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) includes genes encoding antigen-presenting molecules that are highly variable, and that variation often predicts susceptibility/resistance to and recovery from pathogen infection. I compare MHC-B variation at two long-term chimpanzee research sites, Kibale National Park in Uganda and Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Using decades of respiratory health data available for these chimpanzees, I test hypotheses associated with maintenance of diversity at MHC loci, including heterozygote, divergent allele, and rare allele advantage hypotheses, and predictions for unique function of MHC-B in great apes. I found, despite confirmation of recent shared ancestry between Kibale and Gombe chimpanzees, including an overlapping MHC-B allele repertoire and similar MHC-B phenotype compositions, chimpanzees from the two research sites experienced differences in the occurrence of respiratory signs and had different associations of MHC-B diversity with signs of respiratory illness. Kibale chimpanzees with heterozygous genotypes and different peptide-binding supertypes were observed less often with respiratory signs than those homozygous or possessing the same supertypes, but this same association was not observed among Gombe chimpanzees. Gombe chimpanzees with specific MHC-B phenotypes that enable engagement of Natural Killer (NK) cells were observed more often with respiratory signs than chimpanzees with other phenotypes, but this was not observed at Kanyawara. This study emphasizes local adaptation in shaping genetic and phenotypic traits in different infectious disease contexts, even among close genetic relatives of the same subspecies, and highlights utility for continued and simultaneous tracking of host immune genes and specific pathogens in wild species.\nStress response of fire salamander larvae differs between habitat types\nAuthors: Schulte, L.; Oswald, P.; Muehlenhaupt, M.; Ossendorf, E.; Kruse, S.; Kaiser, S.; Caspers, B. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552279\nDifferent habitats can impose varying selection pressures on individuals of the same species. Larvae of the European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) can inhabit two different habitats: streams and ponds. Streams are characterised by lower predation risk and intraspecific density and higher food availability than ponds. Thus, ponds are considered a less suitable habitat. To investigate the differential impacts of the two habitats on larval physiology, we measured the stress response of larvae living in the two different habitats. After successfully validating the measure of water-borne corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in fire salamander larvae, we measured the baseline and stress-induced CORT of 64 larvae from two pond and two stream locations in the field. We found larvae in ponds to be more stressed than larvae in streams. Additionally, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment and tested whether larvae can adapt their stress response to changing habitat conditions. After two weeks of transfer, we did not find an increase in CORT when comparing stress-induced CORT values with baseline CORT values in larvae transferred into ponds. However, larvae transferred into streams exhibited an increase in the stress-induced CORT response. Moreover, transfer into ponds as well as larvae originating from ponds showed reduced growth rates, indicating that ponds might be the more stressful habitat, as it negatively affected larval physiology. These results show that noninvasive hormone measurements can provide information on habitat quality and potential adaptation and thus emphasis the potential for its use in conservation efforts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Prior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change has the potential to alter ecosystem dynamics and wildlife health. Here we show that increasing social connections in response to a hurricane enhanced disease transmission risk for years after the event in a population of rhesus macaques.

        <p class="abstract">1. A standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data. 2. Integrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths. 3. Here, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package). 4. We demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prey profitability for a predator hunting diverse prey varies with species and seasons. Whereas prey selection by aerial-hawking or gleaning bats is well established, this is challenging to establish in species that adopt both these strategies flexibly. Measurable prey traits coupled with availability in the foraging grounds help characterize the vulnerability of prey species to predation. In the Western Ghats of India, a global biodiversity hotspot, we studied an anthropogenic landscape, where insectivorous bats are abundant and diverse, but their impact on moth communities is little understood. We investigated the morphological traits of a sympatric moth community that make them more vulnerable to predation by Megaderma spasma, a bat with flexible foraging strategies. We also established the seasonal composition of moth prey in the diet of the bat. We analyzed the discarded prey remains from several roosts, collected over three years, for seasonal patterns in the diet and selective hunting. Through light-trapping, we collected moth specimens in different seasons to assess the morphological traits of the moth community available in the foraging area of the bat. The traits likely to affect the profitability of prey moths were measured: forewing length, hindwing length, wingspan, and body length (a proxy for body size); forewing area, hindwing area, maneuverability, and wing loading (as a proxy for evasive flight capability), and forewing aspect ratio (as a proxy for wing shape). Our results showed that consumed moth prey diversity varies seasonally, with moths belonging to the Hepialidae family being preferred in the wet season. Moths belonging to the Sphingidae family were the most abundant in the diet, followed by Erebidae and Hepialidae. Sphingid moths have the lowest maneuverability, and highest forewing aspect ratio; the Hepialidae moths have the maximum body size followed by Sphingids thus confirming our hypothesis that larger moths with low evasive capabilities are more vulnerable to predation. Assessing vulnerability at the prey community level, we establish a framework for future research on moth-bat interactions from the diverse and less-explored paleotropical communities. Additionally, the study reiterates the usefulness of trait-based approaches to understanding prey-predator dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Species are often expected to shift their distributions poleward to evade warming climates. However, from 18 years of fixed transect monitoring data on 88 species of butterfly in the midwestern United States, we show that butterflies are shifting their centroids in all directions, except towards regions that are becoming warmer. Butterflies shifted their centroids at a mean rate of 4.87 km yr-1. The rate of centroid shift was significantly associated with local climate change velocity (temperature and precipitation), but not with mean climate change velocity throughout the species ranges. Surprisingly, the centroid shift was also unrelated to species traits expected to mediate the shift response including thermal niche breadth (range of climates butterflies experience throughout their distribution) and wingspan (often used as metric for dispersal capability). Contrasting with a number of previous studies, we observed relatively high phylogenetic signal in the rate and direction species shifted their centroids, suggesting that evolutionary history helps to explain multidirectional range shift responses and that some groups of species will be better able to shift their ranges than others. This research shows important signatures of multidirectional range shifts (latitudinal and longitudinal) and uniquely shows that local climate change velocities are more important in driving range shifts than the mean climate change velocity throughout a species entire range.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ground-nesting birds such as Yellow-wattled Lapwing Vanellus malabaricus (Boddaert, 1783) employ several nesting and behavioral strategies to mitigate nest predation, which greatly influences their reproductive success and survival. Yet the breeding ecology of Yellow-wattled Lapwing has received relatively little research attention despite the species&#39; widespread presence in the Indian subcontinent. The objective of this study was to investigate the significance and impact of two visual concealment strategies commonly utilized by open ground-nesting birds: visual concealment through vegetative characteristics and camouflage using Yellow-wattled Lapwing as the model organism. We also assessed the nest-site selection of Yellow-wattled Lapwings in relation to vegetation cover and food availability, as well as their choice of nest substrate by using behavioral sampling, quadrat sampling, and digital image analysis techniques. We found that variation in hatching success could not be attributed to the analyzed camouflage mechanisms (disruptive markings and pattern complexity matching). Furthermore, the nesting pairs exhibited a preference for areas with high vegetation cover and low food availability while selecting nesting sites. We also showed that this species might exhibit an active behavioral preference for selecting nest substrates. It is important to note that this study was conducted during a single nesting season for the Yellow-wattled Lapwings, and further temporal replicates are necessary to validate and establish the findings over the long term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIntegrated step-selection analyses (ISSAs) are frequently used to study animal movement and habitat selection. Methods for incorporating random effects in ISSAs have been developed, making it possible to quantify variability among animals in their space-use patterns. Although it is possible to model variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters, applications to date have focused on the former despite the widely acknowledged and important role that movement plays in determining ecological processes from the individual to ecosystem level. One potential explanation for this omission is the absence of readily-available software or examples demonstrating methods for estimating movement parameters in ISSAs with random effects.
C_LIO_LITo demonstrate methods for characterizing among-individual variability in both movement and habitatselection parameters, we fit two models to an acoustic telemetry data set involving locations of 35 red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). In the first model, the distribution of snapper step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a categorical habitat variable indicating the type of benthic reef habitat the fish was located in at the start of the movement step. In the second model, step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a continuous variable measuring the distance between the fishs current location and nearest edge habitat. In both models, we also quantified habitat selection for different benthic habitat classes and distance to edge habitat at the end of the movement step.
C_LIO_LIThere was substantial among-individual variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters. Nonetheless, most red snapper selected for high-relief hardbottom habitat and for locations nearer to edge habitat. They also moved less when in high-relief hardbottom habitat or when they were close to reef edges. Turn angles were frequently near {&#43;/-} {pi}, but were more dispersed when fish were far away from edge habitat.
C_LIO_LIWe provide code templates and functions for quantifying variability in movement and habitat-selection parameters when implementing ISSAs with random effects. In doing so, we hope to encourage ecologists conducting ISSAs to take full advantage of their ability to model among-individual variability in both habitat-selection and movement patterns.

        <p class="abstract">To conserve biodiversity, it is imperative to maintain and restore sufficient amounts of functional habitat networks. Hence, locating remaining forests with natural structures and processes over landscapes and large regions is a key task. We integrated machine learning (Random Forest) and open landscape data to scan all forest landscapes in Sweden with a 1 ha spatial resolution with respect to the relative likelihood of hosting High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF). Using independent spatial stand-and plot-level validation data we confirmed that our predictions (ROC AUC in the range of 0.89 - 0.90) correctly represent forests with different levels of naturalness, from deteriorated to those with high and associated biodiversity conservation values. Given ambitious national and international conservation objectives, and increasingly intensive forestry, our model and the resulting wall-to-wall mapping fills an urgent gap for assessing fulfilment of evidence-based conservation targets, spatial planning, and designing forest landscape restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many traits, intrinsic and extrinsic to an organism, contribute to interindividual variation in immunity in wild habitats. The vertebrate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) includes genes encoding antigen-presenting molecules that are highly variable, and that variation often predicts susceptibility/resistance to and recovery from pathogen infection. I compare MHC-B variation at two long-term chimpanzee research sites, Kibale National Park in Uganda and Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Using decades of respiratory health data available for these chimpanzees, I test hypotheses associated with maintenance of diversity at MHC loci, including heterozygote, divergent allele, and rare allele advantage hypotheses, and predictions for unique function of MHC-B in great apes. I found, despite confirmation of recent shared ancestry between Kibale and Gombe chimpanzees, including an overlapping MHC-B allele repertoire and similar MHC-B phenotype compositions, chimpanzees from the two research sites experienced differences in the occurrence of respiratory signs and had different associations of MHC-B diversity with signs of respiratory illness. Kibale chimpanzees with heterozygous genotypes and different peptide-binding supertypes were observed less often with respiratory signs than those homozygous or possessing the same supertypes, but this same association was not observed among Gombe chimpanzees. Gombe chimpanzees with specific MHC-B phenotypes that enable engagement of Natural Killer (NK) cells were observed more often with respiratory signs than chimpanzees with other phenotypes, but this was not observed at Kanyawara. This study emphasizes local adaptation in shaping genetic and phenotypic traits in different infectious disease contexts, even among close genetic relatives of the same subspecies, and highlights utility for continued and simultaneous tracking of host immune genes and specific pathogens in wild species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Different habitats can impose varying selection pressures on individuals of the same species. Larvae of the European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) can inhabit two different habitats: streams and ponds. Streams are characterised by lower predation risk and intraspecific density and higher food availability than ponds. Thus, ponds are considered a less suitable habitat. To investigate the differential impacts of the two habitats on larval physiology, we measured the stress response of larvae living in the two different habitats. After successfully validating the measure of water-borne corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in fire salamander larvae, we measured the baseline and stress-induced CORT of 64 larvae from two pond and two stream locations in the field. We found larvae in ponds to be more stressed than larvae in streams. Additionally, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment and tested whether larvae can adapt their stress response to changing habitat conditions. After two weeks of transfer, we did not find an increase in CORT when comparing stress-induced CORT values with baseline CORT values in larvae transferred into ponds. However, larvae transferred into streams exhibited an increase in the stress-induced CORT response. Moreover, transfer into ponds as well as larvae originating from ponds showed reduced growth rates, indicating that ponds might be the more stressful habitat, as it negatively affected larval physiology. These results show that noninvasive hormone measurements can provide information on habitat quality and potential adaptation and thus emphasis the potential for its use in conservation efforts.</p>
