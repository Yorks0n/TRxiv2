Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.\nSentinels for future coral reef conditions: assessment of environmental variability and water quality in semi-enclosed inland bays in the southern Caribbean\nAuthors: de Jong, C.; van Os, I.; Sepulveda-Rodriguez, G.; de Baat, M. L.; Schoepf, V.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560694\nThe mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and \u003e20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Curacao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Curacaos inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.\nUnveiling the ecology, taxonomy and metabolic capabilities of MBA03, a potential key player in anaerobic digestion\nAuthors: Puchol-Royo, R.; Pascual, J.; Ortega-Legarreta, A.; Otto, P.; Tideman, J.; de Vries, S.-J.; Abendroth, C.; Tanner, K.; Porcar, M.; Latorre-Perez, A.\nScore: 96.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556800\nBiogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.\nOrchards and paddy differentially impact rock outcrop amphibians: Insights from community- and species-level responses\nAuthors: Jithin, V.; Rane, M.; Watve, A.; Naniwadekar, R.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560737\nWith agricultural demands increasing globally, determining the nature of impacts of different forms of agriculture on biodiversity, especially for threatened vertebrates and habitats, is critical to inform land management. We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.

However, it is still difficult to draw precise quantitative conclusions about the ecosystems studied, notably because of biases intrinsic to environmental DNA or introduced during the experimental process. These alter the relationship between the quantities of DNA observed and the biomass or number of individuals of the species detected. Thanks to quantitative PCR techniques, two of the biases inherent to metabarcoding were measured and corrected: the PCR amplification bias and the ratio between total DNA and target DNA concentrations with the marker Sper01 for mock communities of alpine plants. Amplification bias, and more precisely extension bias, was measured by estimating PCR efficiencies using Taqman qPCR. A realistic stochastic model of PCR dynamics taking PCR saturation into account was then used to infer the initial proportions of three characteristic species in two mock communities and has also made it possible to directly infer PCR efficiencies and initial proportions based on a reference community. Digital droplet PCR was also used to take into account the variability in target copy number between the different species. These corrections are easy to implement for analysing metabarcoding data, and have shown promising results to better estimate the DNA relative abundances of the species present in environmental samples. Although it needs to be generalised, this work show the importance of these biases and should encourage the research community to take all known biases into account so that metabarcoding data can be used as reliable biodiversity indicators.\nPopulation-specific responses to developmental temperature in the arboviral vector : implications for climate change\nAuthors: Carlassara, M.; Khorramnejad, A.; Oker, H.; Bahrami, R.; Lozada-Chavez, A. N.; Mancini, M. V.; Body, M. J.; Lahondere, C.; Bonizzoni, M.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561151\nThe increase of environmental temperature due to current global warming is not only favoring the expansion of the distribution range of many insect species, but it is also changing their phenology. Insect phenology is tightly linked to developmental timing, which is regulated by environmental temperatures. However, the degree to which effects of developmental temperatures extend across developmental stages and their inter-stage relationships have not been thoroughly quantified in mosquitoes. Here, we used the mosquito Aedes albopictus, which is an aggressive invasive species and an arboviral vector to study how developmental temperature influences fitness across developmental stages, thermal traits, energy reserves, transcriptome, and Wolbachia prevalence in populations from either temperate or tropical regions. We show that hatchability, larval and pupal viability, and developmental speed are strongly influenced by temperature and these effects extend to wing length, body mass, longevity, content of water, protein and lipids in adults, in a population-specific manner. On the contrary, neither adult thermal preference nor heat resistance significantly change with temperature. Development at 18{degrees}C revealed to be a limiting factor for the proliferation of Wolbachia in adults and transcriptome analysis showed enrichment for functions linked to stress responses (i.e. cuticle proteins and chitin, cytochrome p450, and heat shock proteins) in mosquitoes reared at both 18{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C. Our data showed an overall reduced vector fitness performance when mosquitoes were reared at 32{degrees}C, and the absence of isomorphy in the relationship between developmental stages and temperature in the temperate population. Altogether these results have important implications for reliable model projections of the invasion potentials of Ae. albopictus and its epidemiological impact.\nPocillopora meandrina daytime broadcast spawning in Moorea, French Polynesia\nAuthors: Harnay, P.; Putnam, H. M.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.558016\nPocillopora are abundant branching corals that create 3-dimensional reef structure. In French Polynesia, when corals were decimated by crown-of-thorns, bleaching, and a cyclone between 2007-2010, Pocillopora recruitment primarily drove recovery by 2016, yet spawning times are undocumented. To address this, we surveyed Pocillopora in Moorea between September 2022-January 2023. We documented split-spawning around the full moons, with one colony spawning November 10th (06:32, full moon+3days) and reef-wide spawning December 9th (06:16-06:32; full moon+2days) and December 10th (06:21-06:35; full moon+3days). Molecular analysis (n=16) identified 100% as P. meandrina, with 13 as Haplotype 1a and 3 as Haplotype 8a, suggesting P. verrucosa, P. grandis, and Haplotype 10 spawn on the new moon or in later months. These observations provide initial documentation of Pocillopora spawning in Moorea (to our knowledge), expanding on indigenous knowledge and increasing capacity to study Pocillopora reproduction, connectivity, and adaptation.\nHost plant odour and sex pheromone are integral to mate finding in codling moth\nAuthors: Erdei, A.; Preti, M.; Bengtsson, M.; Witzgall, P.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560528\nBehaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.\nIntraspecific plant-soil feedbacks vary under field conditions among species in a tropical tree community\nAuthors: Eck, J. L.; Hernandez Hassan, L.; Comita, L. S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561486\nPremiseSoil microbes can influence patterns of diversity in plant communities via plant-soil feedbacks. Intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur when plant genotype causes variation in soil microbial composition, resulting in differences in the performance of seedlings growing near their maternal plants versus seedlings growing near non-maternal conspecific plants. How commonly such intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur in natural plant communities is unclear, especially under variable field conditions. MethodsWe conducted an in situ experiment with four native tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Seedlings of each species were transplanted beneath their maternal tree or another conspecific tree in the BCI forest. Mortality and growth were assessed at the end of the wet season ([~]4 months post-transplant) and at the end of the experiment ([~]7 months post-transplant). ResultsPatterns of seedling performance varied among species and were inconsistent over time. Significant effects of field environment were detected for two of the four species: at the end of the wet season, Virola surinamensis seedlings had higher survival beneath their maternal tree than other conspecific trees, while the opposite pattern was found in Ormosia macrocalyx. However, these differences disappeared by the end of the experiment. ConclusionsOur results suggest that intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur inconsistently under field conditions in tropical tree species and may have a limited role in determining seedling performance in tropical tree communities. Future studies are needed to elucidate the environmental and genetic factors that determine the incidence and direction of intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks in plant communities.\nA globally synthesised and flagged bee occurrence dataset and cleaning workflow\nAuthors: Dorey, J.

S.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547152\nSpecies occurrence data are foundational for research, conservation, and science communication, but the limited availability and accessibility of reliable data represents a major obstacle, particularly for insects, which face mounting pressures. We present BeeBDC, a new R package, and a global bee occurrence dataset to address this issue. We combined \u003e18.3 million bee occurrence records from multiple public repositories (GBIF, SCAN, iDigBio, USGS, ALA) and smaller datasets, then standardised, flagged, deduplicated, and cleaned the data using the reproducible BeeBDC R-workflow. Specifically, we harmonised species names (following established global taxonomy), country names, and collection dates and we added record-level flags for a series of potential quality issues. These data are provided in two formats, \"cleaned\" and \"flagged-but-uncleaned\". The BeeBDC package with online documentation provides end users the ability to modify filtering parameters to address their research questions. By publishing reproducible R workflows and globally cleaned datasets, we can increase the accessibility and reliability of downstream analyses. This workflow can be implemented for other taxa to support research and conservation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The Sonoran Desert Toad (Incilius alvarius) is the only animal known to secrete the psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT as a chemical defense, but the source of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius remains unknown. Some amphibians endogenously produce chemical defenses while others acquire them from specialized diets. In this study we analyzed toxin gland secretions and diet profiles from wild I. alvarius and sympatric anurans from native and urban habitats around Tucson, Arizona to explore possible links between diet and 5-MeO-DMT production. All I. alvarius secreted high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT, whereas other sympatric toads did not. The diet of I. alvarius was similar to that of sympatric anurans, indicating that I. alvarius does not exhibit relative dietary specialization. Slight dietary differences between I. alvarius in native and urbanized habitats were observed. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that diet is not directly linked to 5-MeO-DMT production, and support the alternative hypotheses that Sonoran Desert toads synthesize 5-MeO-DMT endogenously or via a microbial symbiont.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and &gt;20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Curacao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Curacaos inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With agricultural demands increasing globally, determining the nature of impacts of different forms of agriculture on biodiversity, especially for threatened vertebrates and habitats, is critical to inform land management. We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.

        <p class="abstract">Metabarcoding analyses have been developed a lot recently because of the performance of this technique in monitoring biodiversity. However, it is still difficult to draw precise quantitative conclusions about the ecosystems studied, notably because of biases intrinsic to environmental DNA or introduced during the experimental process. These alter the relationship between the quantities of DNA observed and the biomass or number of individuals of the species detected. Thanks to quantitative PCR techniques, two of the biases inherent to metabarcoding were measured and corrected: the PCR amplification bias and the ratio between total DNA and target DNA concentrations with the marker Sper01 for mock communities of alpine plants. Amplification bias, and more precisely extension bias, was measured by estimating PCR efficiencies using Taqman qPCR. A realistic stochastic model of PCR dynamics taking PCR saturation into account was then used to infer the initial proportions of three characteristic species in two mock communities and has also made it possible to directly infer PCR efficiencies and initial proportions based on a reference community. Digital droplet PCR was also used to take into account the variability in target copy number between the different species. These corrections are easy to implement for analysing metabarcoding data, and have shown promising results to better estimate the DNA relative abundances of the species present in environmental samples. Although it needs to be generalised, this work show the importance of these biases and should encourage the research community to take all known biases into account so that metabarcoding data can be used as reliable biodiversity indicators.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increase of environmental temperature due to current global warming is not only favoring the expansion of the distribution range of many insect species, but it is also changing their phenology. Insect phenology is tightly linked to developmental timing, which is regulated by environmental temperatures. However, the degree to which effects of developmental temperatures extend across developmental stages and their inter-stage relationships have not been thoroughly quantified in mosquitoes. Here, we used the mosquito Aedes albopictus, which is an aggressive invasive species and an arboviral vector to study how developmental temperature influences fitness across developmental stages, thermal traits, energy reserves, transcriptome, and Wolbachia prevalence in populations from either temperate or tropical regions. We show that hatchability, larval and pupal viability, and developmental speed are strongly influenced by temperature and these effects extend to wing length, body mass, longevity, content of water, protein and lipids in adults, in a population-specific manner. On the contrary, neither adult thermal preference nor heat resistance significantly change with temperature. Development at 18{degrees}C revealed to be a limiting factor for the proliferation of Wolbachia in adults and transcriptome analysis showed enrichment for functions linked to stress responses (i.e. cuticle proteins and chitin, cytochrome p450, and heat shock proteins) in mosquitoes reared at both 18{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C. Our data showed an overall reduced vector fitness performance when mosquitoes were reared at 32{degrees}C, and the absence of isomorphy in the relationship between developmental stages and temperature in the temperate population. Altogether these results have important implications for reliable model projections of the invasion potentials of Ae. albopictus and its epidemiological impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pocillopora are abundant branching corals that create 3-dimensional reef structure. In French Polynesia, when corals were decimated by crown-of-thorns, bleaching, and a cyclone between 2007-2010, Pocillopora recruitment primarily drove recovery by 2016, yet spawning times are undocumented. To address this, we surveyed Pocillopora in Moorea between September 2022-January 2023. We documented split-spawning around the full moons, with one colony spawning November 10th (06:32, full moon&#43;3days) and reef-wide spawning December 9th (06:16-06:32; full moon&#43;2days) and December 10th (06:21-06:35; full moon&#43;3days). Molecular analysis (n=16) identified 100% as P. meandrina, with 13 as Haplotype 1a and 3 as Haplotype 8a, suggesting P. verrucosa, P. grandis, and Haplotype 10 spawn on the new moon or in later months. These observations provide initial documentation of Pocillopora spawning in Moorea (to our knowledge), expanding on indigenous knowledge and increasing capacity to study Pocillopora reproduction, connectivity, and adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Behaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PremiseSoil microbes can influence patterns of diversity in plant communities via plant-soil feedbacks. Intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur when plant genotype causes variation in soil microbial composition, resulting in differences in the performance of seedlings growing near their maternal plants versus seedlings growing near non-maternal conspecific plants. How commonly such intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur in natural plant communities is unclear, especially under variable field conditions.

MethodsWe conducted an in situ experiment with four native tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Seedlings of each species were transplanted beneath their maternal tree or another conspecific tree in the BCI forest. Mortality and growth were assessed at the end of the wet season ([~]4 months post-transplant) and at the end of the experiment ([~]7 months post-transplant).

ResultsPatterns of seedling performance varied among species and were inconsistent over time. Significant effects of field environment were detected for two of the four species: at the end of the wet season, Virola surinamensis seedlings had higher survival beneath their maternal tree than other conspecific trees, while the opposite pattern was found in Ormosia macrocalyx. However, these differences disappeared by the end of the experiment.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks occur inconsistently under field conditions in tropical tree species and may have a limited role in determining seedling performance in tropical tree communities. Future studies are needed to elucidate the environmental and genetic factors that determine the incidence and direction of intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks in plant communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Species occurrence data are foundational for research, conservation, and science communication, but the limited availability and accessibility of reliable data represents a major obstacle, particularly for insects, which face mounting pressures. We present BeeBDC, a new R package, and a global bee occurrence dataset to address this issue. We combined &gt;18.3 million bee occurrence records from multiple public repositories (GBIF, SCAN, iDigBio, USGS, ALA) and smaller datasets, then standardised, flagged, deduplicated, and cleaned the data using the reproducible BeeBDC R-workflow. Specifically, we harmonised species names (following established global taxonomy), country names, and collection dates and we added record-level flags for a series of potential quality issues. These data are provided in two formats, &#34;cleaned&#34; and &#34;flagged-but-uncleaned&#34;. The BeeBDC package with online documentation provides end users the ability to modify filtering parameters to address their research questions. By publishing reproducible R workflows and globally cleaned datasets, we can increase the accessibility and reliability of downstream analyses. This workflow can be implemented for other taxa to support research and conservation.</p>
