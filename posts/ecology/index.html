Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator.

Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.\nDrab and distant birds are studied less than their fancy-feathered friends\nAuthors: Fischer, S. E.; Lindsay, A. M.; Otten, J. G.; Miles, D. B.; Streby, H. M.\nScore: 121.9, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.560707\nHuman decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

Using insights from the Biosphere 2 experiment, we introduced the \"Ecosphere\" and \"Biosealed\" systems in custom containers to replicate Earths ecosystems, suggesting feasible space migration through transplanting Earth-like biomes. Over four years, we gained deeper insights into these enclosed ecosystems. Moisture deficiency was a major obstacle to plant growth, which we addressed by incorporating a groundwater layer in the containers. We underscored the critical role of microorganisms in building and sustaining these ecosystems. However, temperature spikes from sunlight threatened stability. Our experiments confirmed fruit flies survival on plant-produced oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria. Interactions between plants, microbes, and simulated space soils were examined. Detailed analysis unveiled diverse microbes shaping both confined and simulated space environments. Major findings include the symbiotic relationship of plants with cyanobacteria, the potential of LED lighting in sun-limited missions, and challenges with ethylene gas and moisture. Microbial integration in rough soils holds promise for seed germination, but understanding their role in space soils is crucial. Our research offers a comprehensive foundation for future space life-support systems and underlines potential concerns about microbes affecting human health.\nTerrestrial land cover shapes fish diversity in major subtropical rivers\nAuthors: Zhang, H.; Blackman, R.

Yet, knowledge of the spatial extent and magnitude of LULC-aquatic biodiversity linkages is still surprisingly limited, impeding the implementation of optimal management strategies3. Here, we compiled fish diversity data across a 160,000-km2 subtropical river catchment in Thailand characterized by exceptional biodiversity4 yet intense anthropogenic alterations5, and attributed fish species richness and community composition to contemporary terrestrial LULC across the catchment. We estimated a spatial range of LULC effects extending up to about 20 km upstream from sampling sites, and explained nearly 60 % of the variance in the observed species richness, associated with major LULC categories including croplands, forest, and urban areas. We find that integrating both spatial range and magnitudes of LULC effects is needed to accurately predict fish species richness. Further, projected LULC changes showcase future gains and losses of fish species richness across the river network and offer a scalable basis for riverine biodiversity conservation and land management, allowing for potential mitigation of biodiversity loss in highly diverse yet data-deficient tropical to sub-tropical riverine habitats.\nGlobal abundance patterns, diversity, and ecology of Patescibacteria in wastewater treatment plants\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Hu, H.; Kristensen, J. M.; Pjevac, P.; Kitzinger, K.; Herbold, C. W.; Hausmann, B.; Dueholm, M. K. D.; Nielsen, P. H.\nScore: 66.8, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.562895\nBackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning. ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter. ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.\nUnveiling the Hidden Viromes Across the Animal Tree of Life: Insights from a Taxonomic Classification Pipeline Applied to Invertebrates of 31 Metazoan Phyla\nAuthors: Alfonso, P.; Butkovic, A.; Fernandez, R.; Riesgo, A.; Elena, S. F.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565523\nInvertebrates constitute the majority of animal species on Earth, including most disease- causing agents or vectors, with more diverse viromes when compared to vertebrates. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (i) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the Animal Tree of Life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (ii) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus interaction networks, and (iii) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising Retroviridae, Flaviviridae and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes. ImportanceThis study significantly enhances our understanding of the global animal virome by characterizing the viromes of previously unexamined invertebrate lineages from a large number of animal phyla. It showcases the great diversity of viromes within each phylum and investigates the role of habitat shaping animal viral communities. Furthermore, our research identifies dominant virus families in invertebrates and distinguishes phyla with analogous viromes. This study sets the road towards a deeper understanding of the virome across the Animal Tree of Life.\nMicrobial Metamorphosis: Symbiotic bacteria and fungi proliferate during diapause and may enhance overwintering survival in a solitary bee\nAuthors: Christensen, S. M.; Srinivas, S.; McFrederick, Q. S.; Danforth, B.; Buchmann, S. L.; Vannette, R. L.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565352\nHost-microbe interactions underlie the development and fitness of many macroorganisms including bees. While many social bees benefit from vertically transmitted gut bacteria, solitary bees, which comprise the vast majority of species diversity within bees, lack a specialized gut microbiome. Here we examine the composition and abundance of bacteria and fungi throughout the complete life cycle of a ground-nesting solitary bee Anthophora bomboides standfordiana. In contrast to expectations, immature bee stages maintain a distinct core microbiome consisting of Actinobacteria and fungi in the genus Moniliella. Diapausing larval bees hosted the most abundant and distinctive bacteria and fungi, attaining 33 and 52 times their initial copy number, respectively. We tested two adaptive hypotheses regarding microbial functions for overwintering bees. First, using isolated bacteria and fungi, we found that Streptomyces from brood cells inhibited the growth of multiple pathogenic filamentous fungi, suggesting a role in pathogen protection during the long period of diapause. Second, sugar alcohol composition changed in tandem with major changes in microbial abundance suggesting links with bee metabolism or overwintering biology. Our results suggest that Anthophora bomboides hosts a conserved core microbiome that may provide key fitness advantages through larval development and overwintering, and raises the question of how this microbiome is transmitted between generations. The present work suggests that focus on adult gut microbiomes in solitary bees may overlook microbial symbionts within brood cells that could play diverse roles in bee fitness, and that exploration of microbes associated with immature bees may uncover novel microbial effects on insect hosts.\nUnveiling the Microbial Diversity and Associated Secondary Metabolism on Black Apples\nAuthors: Cowled, M. S.; Phippen, C. B. W.; Kromphardt, K. J. K.; Clemmensen, S. E.; Frandsen, R.; Frisvad, J. C.; Larsen, T. O.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565319\nBlack apples are the late-stage microbial decomposition of apples after having fallen to the ground. This phenomenon is highly comparable from year to year, with the filamentous fungus Monilinia fructigena most commonly being the first invader, followed by Penicillium expansum. Motivated by the fact that only little chemistry has been reported from apple microbiomes, we set out to investigate the chemical diversity and potential ecological roles of secondary metabolites (SMs) in a total of 38 black apples. Metabolomics analyses were conducted on either whole apples or small excisions of fungal biomass derived from black apples. Annotation of fungal SMs in black apple extracts was aided by cultivation of 15 recently isolated fungal strains on 9 different substrates in an OSMAC approach, leading to identification of 3319 unique chemical features. Only 6.8% were attributable to known compounds based on analysis of HPLC-HRMS/MS data using spectral library matching tools. Of the 1606 features detected in the black apple extracts, 32% could be assigned as fungal-derived, due to their presence in the OSMAC-based training dataset. Notably, the detection of several antifungal compounds clearly indicates the importance of such compounds for invasion of and control of other microbial competitors on apples. In conclusion, the diversity and abundance of microbial SMs on black apples was found to be much higher than that typically observed for other environmental microbiomes. Detection of SMs known to be produced by the six fungal species tested also highlights a succession of fungal growth following the initial invader M. fructigena. ImportanceMicrobial secondary metabolites constitute a significant reservoir of biologically potent and clinically valuable chemical scaffolds. However, their usefulness is hampered by rapidly developing resistance, resulting in reduced profitability of such research endeavours. Hence, it is vital that the ecological role of such microbial secondary metabolites be considered to understand how best to utilise such compounds as chemotherapeutics. Here, we explore an under-investigated environmental microbiome in the case of black apples; a veritable \"low-hanging fruit\", with relatively high abundances and diversity of microbially produced secondary metabolites. Using both a targeted and untargeted metabolomics approach, the interplay between metabolites, other microbes and the apple host itself was investigated. This study highlights the surprisingly low incidence of known secondary metabolites in such a system, highlighting the need to study the functionality of secondary metabolites in microbial interactions and complex microbiomes.\nGlobal Biogeography of the Soil Virosphere\nAuthors: Graham, E. B.; Camargo, A. P.; Wu, R.; Neches, R. Y.; Nolan, M.; Paez-Espino, D.; Copeland, A.; Kyrpides, N.; Jansson, J. K. K.; McDermott, J. E.; Hofmockel, K. S.; Soil Virosphere Consortium, Score: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565391\nHistorically neglected by microbial ecologists, soil viruses are now thought to be critical to global biogeochemical cycles. However, our understanding of their global distribution, activities, and interactions with the soil microbiome remains limited. Here, we present the Global Soil Virus (GSV) Atlas, a comprehensive dataset from 2,953 soils that comprises 616,935 uncultivated virus genomes (UViGs) and 38,508 unique viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs). Rarefaction curves from the GSV Atlas indicate that most soil viral diversity remains unexplored, further underscored by high spatial turnover and low rates of shared vOTUs across samples. By examining genes associated with biogeochemical functions, we also demonstrate the viral potential to impact soil carbon and nutrient cycling. This study represents the most extensive characterization of soil viral diversity to date and provides a foundation for developing testable hypotheses regarding the role of the virosphere in the soil microbiome and global biogeochemistry.\nTime-dependent Interaction Modification Generated from Plant-soil Feedback\nAuthors: Zou, H.-X.; Yan, X.; Rudolf, V. H. W.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565336\nPairwise interactions between species can be modified by other community members, leading to emergent dynamics that are contingent on the composition of a community. Despite the prevalence of such higher-order interactions, little is known about how they are linked to the timing and order of species arrival. Yet, these temporal patterns typically affect their pairwise interactions (i.e., priority effects) and thus could also modify higher-order interactions in multispecies communities. Here, we first develop a general framework of time-dependent interaction modifications by building on pairwise priority effects. By applying this framework to data generated by a mechanistic plant-soil feedback model, we show that how pairwise interactions are modified by a third plant depends on the relative sequence and spacing of plants germination phenology. This time-dependence of interaction modifications emerges from concurrent changes in plant and microbe populations and they become stronger with a higher overlap between plants associated microbiomes. We discuss how processes in the plant-soil feedback model represent a wide range of mechanisms applicable in other systems from which similar time-dependent interaction modifications can emerge. Our results highlight the need to integrate temporal shifts of species interactions to predict the emergent dynamics of natural communities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ecological interactions, the impact of one organism on the growth and death of another, underpin our understanding of the long-term composition and the functional properties of communities. Interactions from classical ecology are typically understood to be fixed values, representing for example the per-capita consumption rate of prey by its predator. Yet in many ecosystems, such fixed descriptions are inadequate: interactions can depend on local environmental conditions, the time at which they are measured, and the sampled position in a spatially-structured community. In this work, we show that each of these three types of context-dependency can arise from feedbacks between organisms and their environment. At the heart of our theory is the  instantaneous interaction, a quantity that describes whether a given population changes their surroundings in a way that helps or hinders another in a particular environment. This environmentally-dependent quantity then gives rise to time and spatial dependencies as the environment changes over time and/or space. We use small synthetic microbial communities as model ecosystems to demonstrate the power of this framework by showing how we can predict time-dependent intra-specific interactions, and how we can relate time and spatial dependencies in crossfeeding communities. Our frame-work helps to explain the ubiquity of interaction context-dependencies in systems where population changes are driven by environmental changes - such as microbial communities - by placing the environment on an equal theoretical footing as the organisms that inhabit it.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human decisions are influenced by implicit biases, and scientists do not exist in an objectivity vacuum. Subconscious biases in scientists choices about which species to study may beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms. Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in study species selection within a cycle of policymaking, funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases. Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that encompass more universities. We quantified components of aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size) of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically documented human visual preferences and investigated whether these components were associated with research effort. We also quantified each species breeding range size and the number of universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics, familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45% of the variation in the number of published papers about each species from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10% of aesthetic salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10%, and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top 10% of breeding range size and university abundance were studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom 10% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how these biases may influence perceived relative value of species with respect to culture and conservation. The disparities in empirical knowledge we describe here perpetuate a positive feedback loop, thus widening the gap between the avian &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have-nots&#34;, with some questions answered repeatedly while potentially critical discoveries are left undiscovered.

        <p class="abstract">Establishing a sustainable life-support system for space exploration is challenging due to the vast distances, costs, and differing environments from Earth. Using insights from the Biosphere 2 experiment, we introduced the &#34;Ecosphere&#34; and &#34;Biosealed&#34; systems in custom containers to replicate Earths ecosystems, suggesting feasible space migration through transplanting Earth-like biomes.

Over four years, we gained deeper insights into these enclosed ecosystems. Moisture deficiency was a major obstacle to plant growth, which we addressed by incorporating a groundwater layer in the containers. We underscored the critical role of microorganisms in building and sustaining these ecosystems. However, temperature spikes from sunlight threatened stability. Our experiments confirmed fruit flies survival on plant-produced oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria. Interactions between plants, microbes, and simulated space soils were examined. Detailed analysis unveiled diverse microbes shaping both confined and simulated space environments. Major findings include the symbiotic relationship of plants with cyanobacteria, the potential of LED lighting in sun-limited missions, and challenges with ethylene gas and moisture. Microbial integration in rough soils holds promise for seed germination, but understanding their role in space soils is crucial.

Our research offers a comprehensive foundation for future space life-support systems and underlines potential concerns about microbes affecting human health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Freshwater biodiversity is critically affected by human modifications of terrestrial land use and land cover (LULC)1,2. Yet, knowledge of the spatial extent and magnitude of LULC-aquatic biodiversity linkages is still surprisingly limited, impeding the implementation of optimal management strategies3. Here, we compiled fish diversity data across a 160,000-km2 subtropical river catchment in Thailand characterized by exceptional biodiversity4 yet intense anthropogenic alterations5, and attributed fish species richness and community composition to contemporary terrestrial LULC across the catchment. We estimated a spatial range of LULC effects extending up to about 20 km upstream from sampling sites, and explained nearly 60 % of the variance in the observed species richness, associated with major LULC categories including croplands, forest, and urban areas. We find that integrating both spatial range and magnitudes of LULC effects is needed to accurately predict fish species richness. Further, projected LULC changes showcase future gains and losses of fish species richness across the river network and offer a scalable basis for riverine biodiversity conservation and land management, allowing for potential mitigation of biodiversity loss in highly diverse yet data-deficient tropical to sub-tropical riverine habitats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMicroorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning.

ResultsHere, we evaluated the in silico coverage of widely used 16S rRNA gene-targeted primer pairs and redesigned a primer pair targeting the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes to expand its coverage for Patescibacteria. We then experimentally evaluated and compared the performance of the original and modified V4-targeted primers on 565 WWTP samples from the MiDAS global sample collection. Using the modified primer pair, the percentage of ASVs classified as Patescibacteria increased from 5.9% to 23.8%, and the number of detected patescibacterial genera increased from 560 to 1,576, while the detected diversity of the remaining microbial community remained similar. Due to this significantly improved coverage of Patescibacteria, we identified 23 core genera of Patescibacteria in WWTPs and described the global distribution pattern of these unusual microbes in these systems. Finally, correlation network analysis revealed potential host organisms that might be associated with Patescibacteria in WWTPs. Interestingly, strong indications were found for an association between Patescibacteria of the Saccharimonadia and globally abundant polyphosphate-accumulating organisms of the genus Ca. Phosporibacter.

ConclusionsOur study (i) provides an improved 16S rRNA gene V4 region-targeted amplicon primer pair inclusive of Patescibacteria with little impact on the detection of other taxa, (ii) reveals the diversity and distribution patterns of Patescibacteria in WWTPs on a global scale, and (iii) provides new insights into the ecological role and potential hosts of Patescibacteria in WWTPs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invertebrates constitute the majority of animal species on Earth, including most disease- causing agents or vectors, with more diverse viromes when compared to vertebrates. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (i) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the Animal Tree of Life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (ii) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus interaction networks, and (iii) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising Retroviridae, Flaviviridae and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes.

ImportanceThis study significantly enhances our understanding of the global animal virome by characterizing the viromes of previously unexamined invertebrate lineages from a large number of animal phyla. It showcases the great diversity of viromes within each phylum and investigates the role of habitat shaping animal viral communities. Furthermore, our research identifies dominant virus families in invertebrates and distinguishes phyla with analogous viromes. This study sets the road towards a deeper understanding of the virome across the Animal Tree of Life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Host-microbe interactions underlie the development and fitness of many macroorganisms including bees. While many social bees benefit from vertically transmitted gut bacteria, solitary bees, which comprise the vast majority of species diversity within bees, lack a specialized gut microbiome. Here we examine the composition and abundance of bacteria and fungi throughout the complete life cycle of a ground-nesting solitary bee Anthophora bomboides standfordiana. In contrast to expectations, immature bee stages maintain a distinct core microbiome consisting of Actinobacteria and fungi in the genus Moniliella. Diapausing larval bees hosted the most abundant and distinctive bacteria and fungi, attaining 33 and 52 times their initial copy number, respectively. We tested two adaptive hypotheses regarding microbial functions for overwintering bees. First, using isolated bacteria and fungi, we found that Streptomyces from brood cells inhibited the growth of multiple pathogenic filamentous fungi, suggesting a role in pathogen protection during the long period of diapause. Second, sugar alcohol composition changed in tandem with major changes in microbial abundance suggesting links with bee metabolism or overwintering biology. Our results suggest that Anthophora bomboides hosts a conserved core microbiome that may provide key fitness advantages through larval development and overwintering, and raises the question of how this microbiome is transmitted between generations. The present work suggests that focus on adult gut microbiomes in solitary bees may overlook microbial symbionts within brood cells that could play diverse roles in bee fitness, and that exploration of microbes associated with immature bees may uncover novel microbial effects on insect hosts.</p>

Motivated by the fact that only little chemistry has been reported from apple microbiomes, we set out to investigate the chemical diversity and potential ecological roles of secondary metabolites (SMs) in a total of 38 black apples. Metabolomics analyses were conducted on either whole apples or small excisions of fungal biomass derived from black apples. Annotation of fungal SMs in black apple extracts was aided by cultivation of 15 recently isolated fungal strains on 9 different substrates in an OSMAC approach, leading to identification of 3319 unique chemical features. Only 6.8% were attributable to known compounds based on analysis of HPLC-HRMS/MS data using spectral library matching tools. Of the 1606 features detected in the black apple extracts, 32% could be assigned as fungal-derived, due to their presence in the OSMAC-based training dataset. Notably, the detection of several antifungal compounds clearly indicates the importance of such compounds for invasion of and control of other microbial competitors on apples. In conclusion, the diversity and abundance of microbial SMs on black apples was found to be much higher than that typically observed for other environmental microbiomes. Detection of SMs known to be produced by the six fungal species tested also highlights a succession of fungal growth following the initial invader M. fructigena.

ImportanceMicrobial secondary metabolites constitute a significant reservoir of biologically potent and clinically valuable chemical scaffolds. However, their usefulness is hampered by rapidly developing resistance, resulting in reduced profitability of such research endeavours. Hence, it is vital that the ecological role of such microbial secondary metabolites be considered to understand how best to utilise such compounds as chemotherapeutics. Here, we explore an under-investigated environmental microbiome in the case of black apples; a veritable &#34;low-hanging fruit&#34;, with relatively high abundances and diversity of microbially produced secondary metabolites. Using both a targeted and untargeted metabolomics approach, the interplay between metabolites, other microbes and the apple host itself was investigated. This study highlights the surprisingly low incidence of known secondary metabolites in such a system, highlighting the need to study the functionality of secondary metabolites in microbial interactions and complex microbiomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Historically neglected by microbial ecologists, soil viruses are now thought to be critical to global biogeochemical cycles. However, our understanding of their global distribution, activities, and interactions with the soil microbiome remains limited. Here, we present the Global Soil Virus (GSV) Atlas, a comprehensive dataset from 2,953 soils that comprises 616,935 uncultivated virus genomes (UViGs) and 38,508 unique viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs). Rarefaction curves from the GSV Atlas indicate that most soil viral diversity remains unexplored, further underscored by high spatial turnover and low rates of shared vOTUs across samples. By examining genes associated with biogeochemical functions, we also demonstrate the viral potential to impact soil carbon and nutrient cycling. This study represents the most extensive characterization of soil viral diversity to date and provides a foundation for developing testable hypotheses regarding the role of the virosphere in the soil microbiome and global biogeochemistry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pairwise interactions between species can be modified by other community members, leading to emergent dynamics that are contingent on the composition of a community. Despite the prevalence of such higher-order interactions, little is known about how they are linked to the timing and order of species arrival. Yet, these temporal patterns typically affect their pairwise interactions (i.e., priority effects) and thus could also modify higher-order interactions in multispecies communities. Here, we first develop a general framework of time-dependent interaction modifications by building on pairwise priority effects. By applying this framework to data generated by a mechanistic plant-soil feedback model, we show that how pairwise interactions are modified by a third plant depends on the relative sequence and spacing of plants germination phenology. This time-dependence of interaction modifications emerges from concurrent changes in plant and microbe populations and they become stronger with a higher overlap between plants associated microbiomes. We discuss how processes in the plant-soil feedback model represent a wide range of mechanisms applicable in other systems from which similar time-dependent interaction modifications can emerge. Our results highlight the need to integrate temporal shifts of species interactions to predict the emergent dynamics of natural communities.</p>
