Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.\nPeriodic shifts in viral load increase risk of spillover from bats\nAuthors: Lunn, T. J.; Borremans, B.; Jones, D. N.; Kessler, M. K.; Dale, A. S.; Yinda, K. C.; Ruiz-Aravena, M.; Falvo, C. A.; Crowley, D.; Lloyd-Smith, J. O.; Munster, V. J.; Eby, P.; McCallum, H.; Hudson, P.; Restif, O.; McGuire, L. P.; Smith, I. L.; Bat One Health Group, ; Plowright, R. K.; Peel, A. J.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556454\nPrediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone. Significance statementWe present a comprehensive analysis of a high-profile bat-virus system (Hendra virus in Australian flying-foxes) to demonstrate that both prevalence and viral loads can shift systematically over time, resulting in concentrated periods of increased spillover risk when prevalence and viral loads are high. We further suggest that prolonged periods of low-prevalence, low-load shedding may not reflect excretion of infectious virus, resolving the outstanding puzzle of why spillovers have not been observed during periods of low off-season prevalence in subtropical Australia, or more frequently in tropical Australia despite consistent low-prevalence shedding. The consideration of viral loads (or proxies of viral load) along with prevalence may improve risk inference from longitudinal surveys of zoonotic viruses across wildlife reservoir hosts.\nTowards interpretable learned representations for Ecoacoustics using variational auto-encoding\nAuthors: Gibb, K. A.; Eldridge, A.; Sandom, C. J.; Simpson, I. J. A.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556690\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm -a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) -to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardwares frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.\nScale-dependent landscape-biodiversity relationships shape multi-taxa diversity in an oil palm monoculture under restoration\nAuthors: Cayetano, D. T.; Zemp, D. C.; Buchori, D.; Fiedler, S.; Grass, I.; Hölscher, D.; Irawan, B.; Korol, Y.; Khokthong, W.; Paterno, G. B.; Polle, A.; Potapov, A.; Sundawati, L.; Tscharntke, T.; Westphal, C.; Weigelt, P.; Wiegand, K.; Kreft, H.; Guerrero-Ramirez, N. R.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556058\nEnhancing biodiversity in monoculture-dominated landscapes is a pressing restoration challenge. Tree islands can enhance biodiversity locally, but the role of scale-dependent processes on local biodiversity remains unclear. Using a multi-scale approach, we explored how scale-dependent processes influence the diversity of seven taxa (woody plants, understory arthropods, birds, herbaceous plants and soil bacteria, fauna, and fungi) within 52 experimental tree islands embedded in an oil palm landscape. We show that local, metacommunity (between islands), and landscape properties shaped above- and below-ground taxa diversity, with the stronger effects on above-ground taxa. The spatial extent that best-predicted diversity ranged from 150 m for woody plants to 700 m for understory arthropods with below-ground taxa responding at large spatial extents. Our results underscore the need for multi-scale approaches to restoration. Additionally, our findings contribute to understanding the complex processes shaping multi-taxa diversity and offer insights for targeted conservation and restoration strategies.\nEffects of forest urbanization on the interplay between small mammal communities and their gut microbiota\nAuthors: Bouilloud, M.; Galan, M.; Pradel, J.; Loiseau, A.; FERRERO, J.; Gallet, R.; Roche, B.; Charbonnel, N.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556680\nUrbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.\nToward a synthesis of phytoplankton community composition methods for global-scale application\nAuthors: Kramer, S. J.; Bolanos, L. M.; Catlett, D.; Chase, A. P.; Behrenfeld, M. J.; Boss, E. S.; Crockford, E. T.; Giovannoni, S. J.; Graff, J. R.; Haëntjens, N.; Karp-Boss, L.; Peacock, E. E.; Roesler, C. S.; Sosik, H. M.; Siegel, D. A.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556589\nThe composition of the marine phytoplankton community has been shown to impact many biogeochemical processes and marine ecosystem services. A variety of methods exist to characterize phytoplankton community composition (PCC), with varying degrees of taxonomic resolution. Accordingly, the resulting PCC determinations are dependent on the method used. Here, we use surface ocean samples collected in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans to compare high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment-based PCC to four other methods: quantitative cell imaging, flow cytometry, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. These methods allow characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic PCC across a wide range of size classes. PCC estimates of many taxa resolved at the class level (e.g., diatoms) show strong positive correlations across methods, while other groups (e.g., dinoflagellates) are not well captured by one or more methods. Since variations in phytoplankton pigment concentrations are related to changes in optical properties, this combined dataset expands the potential scope of ocean color remote sensing by associating PCC at the genus- and species-level with group- or class-level PCC from pigments. Quantifying the strengths and limitations of pigment-based PCC methods compared to PCC assessments from amplicon sequencing, imaging, and cytometry methods is the first step toward the robust validation of remote sensing approaches to quantify PCC from space.\nA novel spawning survey: identifying spawning times and locations of jack mackerel in a semi-closed bay using environmental DNA analysis\nAuthors: Tsuji, S.; Murakami, H.; Masuda, R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.557099\nUnderstanding spawning ecology is vital for species/population management and conservation. Conventional surveys for this, however, are generally time- and labour-demanding and invasive. To overcome these challenges, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has emerged as a promising spawning survey method. This study aimed to identify the spawning season, times, and locations of Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) through eDNA analysis and to investigate the utility of eDNA analysis in spawning surveys. We expected that eDNA concentration and nuclear/mitochondrial DNA ratio should change overnight due to sperm-derived eDNA as this species is a nocturnal spawner. The eDNA concentrations at sunset and sunrise at three sites in Maizuru Bay were compared on a monthly for one year. Our results showed significant increases in eDNA concentrations and ratios at all sites in July, suggesting potential spawning occurrences. At the site with a particularly large increase in concentration, temporal monitoring showed a diurnal eDNA peak (21:00-24:00), likely reflecting the jack mackerel spawning time window. Subsequently, our eDNA-based estimations were supported by the successful capture of their eggs using a plankton net. This is the first report providing evidence of saltwater fish spawning using eDNA analysis, underscoring the usefulness of this approach for spawning detection.\nMGDrivE 3: A decoupled vector-human framework for epidemiological simulation of mosquito genetic control tools and their surveillance\nAuthors: Mondal, A.; Sanchez C., H. M.; Marshall, J. M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556958\nNovel mosquito genetic control tools, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, hold great promise in reducing the global burden of vector-borne diseases. As these technologies advance through the research and development pipeline, there is a growing need for modeling frameworks incorporating increasing levels of entomological and epidemiological detail in order to address questions regarding logistics and biosafety. Epidemiological predictions are becoming increasingly relevant to the development of target product profiles and the design of field trials and interventions, while entomological surveillance is becoming increasingly important to regulation and biosafety. We present MGDrivE 3 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 3), a new version of a previously-developed framework, MGDrivE 2, that investigates the spatial population dynamics of mosquito genetic control systems and their epidemiological implications. The new framework incorporates three major developments: i) a decoupled sampling algorithm allowing the vector portion of the MGDrivE framework to be paired with a more detailed epidemiological framework, ii) a version of the Imperial College London malaria transmission model, which incorporates age structure, various forms of immunity, and human and vector interventions, and iii) a surveillance module that tracks mosquitoes captured by traps throughout the simulation. Example MGDrivE 3 simulations are presented demonstrating the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based homing gene drive linked to dual disease-refractory genes and their potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. Simulations are also presented demonstrating surveillance of such a system by a network of mosquito traps. MGDrivE 3 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MGDrivE2) (version 2.1.0), and extensive examples and vignettes are provided. We intend the software to aid in understanding of human health impacts and biosafety of mosquito genetic control tools, and continue to iterate per feedback from the genetic control community. Author summaryVector-borne diseases such as malaria cause massive morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world. Currently-available control measures, such as insecticide-based tools and antimalarial drugs, have limited impact and are waning in effectiveness, hence there is a need for novel tools to complement existing ones. Mosquito genetic control tools, such as gene drive systems and genetic versions of the sterile insect technique, offer a range of promising options, the development of which has greatly expanded since the advent of CRISPR-based gene-editing. Recently, we proposed MGDrivE 2 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2), which incorporates epidemiology into simulations of the dynamics of these systems in spatially-structured mosquito populations; however, that framework relied on simple model representations of vector-borne diseases. Here, we present MGDrivE 3, which decouples the vector portion of the model from the human portion, allowing the mosquito genetic control framework to be paired with more-detailed epidemiological frameworks. As an example, we implement the human transmission dynamics of the Imperial College London malaria model. We also incorporate a network of mosquito traps for surveillance. As genetic control technology edges closer towards field implementation, more detailed predictions of its epidemiological and biosafety implications are needed. We propose MGDrivE 3 to fulfill this role.\nTree diversity increases forest temperature buffering\nAuthors: Schnabel, F.; Beugnon, R.; Yang, B.; Richter, R.; Eisenhauer, N.; Huang, Y.; Liu, X.; Wirth, C.; Cesarz, S.; Fichtner, A.; Perles-Garcia, M. D.; Hähn, G. J. A.; Härdtle, W.; Kunz, M.; Castro Izaguirre, N. C.; Niklaus, P. A.; von Oheimb, G.; Schmid, B.; Trogisch, S.; Wendisch, M.; Ma, K.; Bruelheide, H.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.556807\nSummary paragraphGlobal warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of climate extremes1. Forests may buffer such extreme events by creating their own microclimate below their canopy via cooling hot and insulating against cold macroclimate air temperatures2,3. This buffering capacity of forests may be increased by tree diversity4,5 and may itself maintain forest functioning and biodiversity6,7. However, despite its relevance for many ecosystem processes, the effect of tree diversity on temperature buffering is largely unexplored. Here, we show that tree species richness consistently increases forest temperature buffering across daily, monthly, and annual scales over six years. This finding is based on data from a large-scale tree diversity experiment covering a species richness gradient of 1 to 24 tree species. We found that species richness strengthened both components of forest temperature buffering2,6: the attenuation of hot and of cold macroclimate air temperatures, with the cooling effect being more pronounced. The buffering effect of tree species richness was mediated by canopy density and structural diversity, assessed as leaf area index and stand structural complexity index5, respectively. Safeguarding and planting diverse forests8 may thus mitigate negative effects of global warming and climate extremes on ecosystem functions and communities below the tree canopy.\nNeonicotinoids, more than herbicides, land use, and climate, drive recent butterfly declines in the American Midwest\nAuthors: Van Deynze, B.; Swinton, S. M.; Hennessy, D. A.; Haddad, N.; Ries, L.\nScore: 51.2, Published: 2023-08-26 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.29.502042\nMounting evidence shows insects are in decline globally. Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research. One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Biogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.

Significance statementWe present a comprehensive analysis of a high-profile bat-virus system (Hendra virus in Australian flying-foxes) to demonstrate that both prevalence and viral loads can shift systematically over time, resulting in concentrated periods of increased spillover risk when prevalence and viral loads are high. We further suggest that prolonged periods of low-prevalence, low-load shedding may not reflect excretion of infectious virus, resolving the outstanding puzzle of why spillovers have not been observed during periods of low off-season prevalence in subtropical Australia, or more frequently in tropical Australia despite consistent low-prevalence shedding. The consideration of viral loads (or proxies of viral load) along with prevalence may improve risk inference from longitudinal surveys of zoonotic viruses across wildlife reservoir hosts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm -a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) -to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardwares frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enhancing biodiversity in monoculture-dominated landscapes is a pressing restoration challenge. Tree islands can enhance biodiversity locally, but the role of scale-dependent processes on local biodiversity remains unclear. Using a multi-scale approach, we explored how scale-dependent processes influence the diversity of seven taxa (woody plants, understory arthropods, birds, herbaceous plants and soil bacteria, fauna, and fungi) within 52 experimental tree islands embedded in an oil palm landscape. We show that local, metacommunity (between islands), and landscape properties shaped above- and below-ground taxa diversity, with the stronger effects on above-ground taxa. The spatial extent that best-predicted diversity ranged from 150 m for woody plants to 700 m for understory arthropods with below-ground taxa responding at large spatial extents. Our results underscore the need for multi-scale approaches to restoration. Additionally, our findings contribute to understanding the complex processes shaping multi-taxa diversity and offer insights for targeted conservation and restoration strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The composition of the marine phytoplankton community has been shown to impact many biogeochemical processes and marine ecosystem services. A variety of methods exist to characterize phytoplankton community composition (PCC), with varying degrees of taxonomic resolution. Accordingly, the resulting PCC determinations are dependent on the method used. Here, we use surface ocean samples collected in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans to compare high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment-based PCC to four other methods: quantitative cell imaging, flow cytometry, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. These methods allow characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic PCC across a wide range of size classes. PCC estimates of many taxa resolved at the class level (e.g., diatoms) show strong positive correlations across methods, while other groups (e.g., dinoflagellates) are not well captured by one or more methods. Since variations in phytoplankton pigment concentrations are related to changes in optical properties, this combined dataset expands the potential scope of ocean color remote sensing by associating PCC at the genus- and species-level with group- or class-level PCC from pigments. Quantifying the strengths and limitations of pigment-based PCC methods compared to PCC assessments from amplicon sequencing, imaging, and cytometry methods is the first step toward the robust validation of remote sensing approaches to quantify PCC from space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding spawning ecology is vital for species/population management and conservation. Conventional surveys for this, however, are generally time- and labour-demanding and invasive. To overcome these challenges, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has emerged as a promising spawning survey method. This study aimed to identify the spawning season, times, and locations of Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) through eDNA analysis and to investigate the utility of eDNA analysis in spawning surveys. We expected that eDNA concentration and nuclear/mitochondrial DNA ratio should change overnight due to sperm-derived eDNA as this species is a nocturnal spawner. The eDNA concentrations at sunset and sunrise at three sites in Maizuru Bay were compared on a monthly for one year. Our results showed significant increases in eDNA concentrations and ratios at all sites in July, suggesting potential spawning occurrences. At the site with a particularly large increase in concentration, temporal monitoring showed a diurnal eDNA peak (21:00-24:00), likely reflecting the jack mackerel spawning time window. Subsequently, our eDNA-based estimations were supported by the successful capture of their eggs using a plankton net. This is the first report providing evidence of saltwater fish spawning using eDNA analysis, underscoring the usefulness of this approach for spawning detection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Novel mosquito genetic control tools, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, hold great promise in reducing the global burden of vector-borne diseases. As these technologies advance through the research and development pipeline, there is a growing need for modeling frameworks incorporating increasing levels of entomological and epidemiological detail in order to address questions regarding logistics and biosafety. Epidemiological predictions are becoming increasingly relevant to the development of target product profiles and the design of field trials and interventions, while entomological surveillance is becoming increasingly important to regulation and biosafety. We present MGDrivE 3 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 3), a new version of a previously-developed framework, MGDrivE 2, that investigates the spatial population dynamics of mosquito genetic control systems and their epidemiological implications. The new framework incorporates three major developments: i) a decoupled sampling algorithm allowing the vector portion of the MGDrivE framework to be paired with a more detailed epidemiological framework, ii) a version of the Imperial College London malaria transmission model, which incorporates age structure, various forms of immunity, and human and vector interventions, and iii) a surveillance module that tracks mosquitoes captured by traps throughout the simulation. Example MGDrivE 3 simulations are presented demonstrating the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based homing gene drive linked to dual disease-refractory genes and their potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. Simulations are also presented demonstrating surveillance of such a system by a network of mosquito traps. MGDrivE 3 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MGDrivE2) (version 2.1.0), and extensive examples and vignettes are provided. We intend the software to aid in understanding of human health impacts and biosafety of mosquito genetic control tools, and continue to iterate per feedback from the genetic control community.

Author summaryVector-borne diseases such as malaria cause massive morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world. Currently-available control measures, such as insecticide-based tools and antimalarial drugs, have limited impact and are waning in effectiveness, hence there is a need for novel tools to complement existing ones.

Mosquito genetic control tools, such as gene drive systems and genetic versions of the sterile insect technique, offer a range of promising options, the development of which has greatly expanded since the advent of CRISPR-based gene-editing. Recently, we proposed MGDrivE 2 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2), which incorporates epidemiology into simulations of the dynamics of these systems in spatially-structured mosquito populations; however, that framework relied on simple model representations of vector-borne diseases. Here, we present MGDrivE 3, which decouples the vector portion of the model from the human portion, allowing the mosquito genetic control framework to be paired with more-detailed epidemiological frameworks. As an example, we implement the human transmission dynamics of the Imperial College London malaria model. We also incorporate a network of mosquito traps for surveillance. As genetic control technology edges closer towards field implementation, more detailed predictions of its epidemiological and biosafety implications are needed. We propose MGDrivE 3 to fulfill this role.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary paragraphGlobal warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of climate extremes1. Forests may buffer such extreme events by creating their own microclimate below their canopy via cooling hot and insulating against cold macroclimate air temperatures2,3. This buffering capacity of forests may be increased by tree diversity4,5 and may itself maintain forest functioning and biodiversity6,7. However, despite its relevance for many ecosystem processes, the effect of tree diversity on temperature buffering is largely unexplored. Here, we show that tree species richness consistently increases forest temperature buffering across daily, monthly, and annual scales over six years. This finding is based on data from a large-scale tree diversity experiment covering a species richness gradient of 1 to 24 tree species. We found that species richness strengthened both components of forest temperature buffering2,6: the attenuation of hot and of cold macroclimate air temperatures, with the cooling effect being more pronounced. The buffering effect of tree species richness was mediated by canopy density and structural diversity, assessed as leaf area index and stand structural complexity index5, respectively. Safeguarding and planting diverse forests8 may thus mitigate negative effects of global warming and climate extremes on ecosystem functions and communities below the tree canopy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mounting evidence shows insects are in decline globally. Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research.

One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.</p>
