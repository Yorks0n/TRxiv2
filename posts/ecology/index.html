Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum.">

However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.\nGeographically widespread and novel hemotropic mycoplasmas and bartonellae in Mexican free-tailed bats and sympatric North American bat species\nAuthors: Becker, D.; Dyer, K.; Lock, L.; Pladas, S.; Sukhadia, A.; Demory, B.; Nunes Batista, J.; Pineda, M.; Simmons, N.; Adams, A.; Frick, W.; O'Mara, T.; Volokhov, D.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.577874\nBacterial pathogens remain poorly characterized in bats, especially in North America. We describe novel (and in some cases panmictic) hemoplasmas (12.9% positivity) and bartonellae (16.7% positivity) across three colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis), a partially migratory species that can seasonally travel hundreds of kilometers. Molecular analyses identified three novel Candidatus hemoplasma species most similar to another novel Candidatus species in Neotropical molossid bats. We also detected novel hemoplasmas in sympatric cave myotis (Myotis velifer) and pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus), with sequences in the latter 96.5% related to C. Mycoplasma haemohominis. We identified eight Bartonella genotypes, including those in cave myotis, with 96.7% similarity to C. Bartonella mayotimonensis. We also detected Bartonella rochalimae in migratory Tadarida brasiliensis, representing the first report of this human pathogen in bats. The seasonality and diversity of these bacteria observed here suggest that additional longitudinal, genomic, and immunological studies in bats are warranted.\nDoes method of field preparation affect survival and growth of juvenile Chinook salmon in agricultural floodplains?\nAuthors: Tallman, R.; Wampler, A.; Singer, G.; Jeffres, C.; Cocherell, D.; Colby, J.; Fangue, N.; Lusardi, R.; Rypel, A.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578246\nThere is growing interest to integrate conservation initiatives into agricultural practices using a reconciliation ecology framework. In Californias Central Valley, one approach to improving crucial nursery habitat for threatened and endangered fish species is by re-creating floodplain habitats through the inundation of agricultural fields during the non-growing season. We conducted a series of field experiments in agricultural floodplains (winter-flooded rice fields that were once natural floodplains) to explore whether different field preparation methods enhanced growth and survival of floodplain-dependent fish species. Approximately 8,000 juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared for at least 28 days on eight, 0.2 ha experimental fields. Each experimental field represented one of four treatments (two replicates per treatment): addition of large wood, addition of in-field canals, addition of both large wood and in-field canals, and control-where no additional field preparations were implemented beyond standard post-growing practices: i.e., chopping rice into stubble, baling and removing excess rice straw, and discing the field with a single pass by plowing rice straw into the ground to promote decomposition. We found no significant difference in water temperature, fish growth or fish survival among habitat treatments. Across treatments, survival ranged from 50.1%-78.3% and averaged 65.75% (/- 7.89% SE). These findings suggest agricultural floodplains require no additional modifications to promote fish growth and survival. Results illustrate the benefits of integrating working landscapes with conservation initiatives by creating more accessible and beneficial habitat for native fishes.\nBetween a Warm Winter and a Cold Spell: Physiological Responses to Changing Winter Climate in Amphibians\nAuthors: Schmidt, R.; Zummach, C.; Sinai, N.; Sabino-Pinto, J.; Kuenzel, S.; Dausmann, K. H.; Ruthsatz, K.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574103\nClimate change is swiftly altering environmental winter conditions, leading to significant ecological impacts such as phenological shifts in many species. As a result, animals might face physiological mismatches due to longer or earlier activity periods and are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. Our study points for the first time to the complex physiological challenges that amphibians face as a result of changing thermal conditions due to winter climate change. We investigated the physiological responses to a period of warmer winter days and sudden spring freeze in the common toad (Bufo bufo) by acclimating them to 4{degrees}C or 8{degrees}C for 48 h or exposing them to 4{degrees}C or -2{degrees}C for 6 h, respectively. We assessed the daily energy demands, determined body condition and cold tolerance, explored the molecular responses to freezing through hepatic tissue transcriptome analysis, and measured blood glucose levels. Toads acclimated to higher temperatures showed a higher daily energy expenditure and a reduced cold tolerance suggesting faster depletion of energy stores and the loss of winter acclimation during warmer winters. Blood sugar levels were higher in frozen toads indicating the mobilization of cryoprotective glucose with freezing which was further supported by changed patterns in proteins related to glucose metabolism. Overall, our results emphasize that increased thermal variability incurs physiological costs that may reduce energy reserves and thus affect amphibian health and survival. This might pose a serious threat to breeding adults and may have subsequent effects at the population level.\nModelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of multispecies population interactions in the context of climate change\nAuthors: Christou, K.; Schmucki, R.; Audusseau, H.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579316\n1. Species interactions are fundamental to the stability and productivity of ecosystems. To improve our capacity to predict and understand how climate change shapes the distribution of species and the dynamics of biotic interactions, we need to develop spatially explicit multi-species models that are built upon species-specific responses to changing conditions. 2. We developed a two-dimensional diffusion-advection-reaction predator-prey model that integrates species-specific responses to heterogeneous landscapes, affecting species dispersal, reproduction and survival rates. We derived conditions for the stability and feasibility of the coexistence steady-state and observed how temperature variation stabilises or destabilises the system. 3. We conducted numerical simulations to explore the effect of predicted extreme temperatures on the spatial dynamics of a parasitoid-butterfly system and their interactions. Applied to four different climatic environments, the numerical approximations demonstrate the asymmetric impact of a warming climate on interacting species. The output density distribution maps highlight the capability of our model to produce interpretable multiscale predictions which can be used to identify and evaluate species vulnerability locally and across their range. 4. By building upon a solid mechanistic understanding of species-specific responses to environmental change, our model can be extended to other species and variables, including environments where the availability of empirical data is limited, and explore the dynamics and distribution of interacting species under different scenarios of environmental change.\nQuantifying the IUCN Red List: Using historical assessments to calculate future extinction risk\nAuthors: Bates, R.; Taylor, E.; Sun, Y.; Gumbs, R.; Böhm, M.; Gray, C.; Rosindell, J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578808\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species assigns species to discrete categories based on a common set of criteria to capture relative extinction risk. Some quantitative analyses require a continuous probability of extinction not provided by discrete categories. Furthermore, the criteria may not translate to extinction risk in a universal way across species, because some species attributes are not incorporated into the criteria. Here we calculate extinction risk using Markov Models parameterised with historical IUCN Red List assessment data, and we provide quantitative extinction risk for use in downstream analyses. We find that taxonomy, body size, and habitat specialism interact with extinction risk in ways not fully captured by the existing categories. For example, an Endangered habitat specialist appears equally at risk compared to a Critically Endangered habitat generalist. We hope our findings will support more accurate quantitative biodiversity analyses of species extinctions and declines using Red List data.\nSelfish herd effects in aggregated caterpillars and their interaction with warning signals\nAuthors: Kersh-Mellor, R.; Montgomery, S. H.; McLellan, C. F.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578162\nLarval Lepidoptera gain survival advantages by aggregating, especially when combined with aposematic warning signals, yet reductions in predation risk may not be experienced equally across all group members. Hamiltons selfish herd theory predicts that larvae which surround themselves with their group mates should be at lower risk of predation, and those on the periphery of aggregations experience the greatest risk, yet this has rarely been tested. Here, we expose aggregations of artificial caterpillar targets to predation from free-flying, wild birds to test for marginal predation when all prey are equally accessible, and for an interaction between warning colouration and marginal predation. We find that targets nearer the centre of the aggregation survived better than peripheral targets and nearby targets isolated from the group. However, there was no difference in survival between peripheral and isolated targets. We also find that grouped targets survived better than isolated targets when both are aposematic, but not when they are non-signalling. Our data suggest that avian predators preferentially target peripheral larvae from aggregations, and that prey warning signals enhance predator avoidance of groups.\nPhysiological and behavioural resistance of malaria vectors in rural West-Africa : a data mining study to address their fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity, drivers, and predictability\nAuthors: Taconet, P.; SOMA, D. D.; Zogo, B.; Mouline, K.; Simard, F.; Koffi, A. A.; Dabire, R. K.; Pennetier, C.; Moiroux, N.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.20.504631\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.\nThe global root exudate carbon flux\nAuthors: Chari, N. R.; Tumber-Davila, S. J.; Phillips, R. P.; Bauerle, T. L.; Brunn, M.; Hafner, B. D.; Klein, T.; Obersteiner, S.; Reay, M. K.; Ullah, S.; Taylor, B. N.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578470\nRoot exudation, the export of low-molecular weight organic carbon (C) from living plant roots to soil, influences microbial activity, nutrient availability, and ecosystem feedbacks to climate change, but the magnitude of this C flux at ecosystem and global scales is largely unknown. Here, we synthesize in situ measurements of root exudation rates and couple those to estimates of fine root biomass to estimate global and biome-level root exudate C fluxes. We estimate a global root exudate flux of 15.2 PgC y-1, or about 10% of global annual gross primary productivity. We found no differences in root mass-specific exudation rates among biomes, though total exudate fluxes are estimated to be greatest in grasslands owing to their high density of absorptive root biomass. Our synthesis highlights the global importance of root exudates in the terrestrial C cycle and identifies regions where more in situ measurements are needed to improve future estimates of root exudate C fluxes.\nIndividual contributions to nest building and incubation by cooperatively breeding American Crows\nAuthors: Peterson, C. C.; Hackler, T. W.; Caffrey, C.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578444\nAmerican Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos) are long-lived birds with pair bonds that may last many years. Pairs in Stillwater, OK, nested singly or in groups with up to 10 auxiliaries (Caffrey and Peterson 2015). Breeders did most of the nest building. Pair members contributed at approximately equal rates, although the sexes differed slightly in details: males tended to carry sticks and hand off materials more often, and females spent more time at and in nests. Both sexes worked faster on second and third attempts than on first attempts of the season. We found no evidence that pair members were (sexually) signaling to each other via their contributions. Incubation periods were characterized by low levels of activity at nests, where females spent most of their time and were fed once every 3-4 hours, mostly by their mates. Contributions to both stages of nesting by auxiliaries varied widely and exhibited no patterns with respect to any measured phenotypic characteristics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial pathogens remain poorly characterized in bats, especially in North America. We describe novel (and in some cases panmictic) hemoplasmas (12.9% positivity) and bartonellae (16.7% positivity) across three colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis), a partially migratory species that can seasonally travel hundreds of kilometers. Molecular analyses identified three novel Candidatus hemoplasma species most similar to another novel Candidatus species in Neotropical molossid bats. We also detected novel hemoplasmas in sympatric cave myotis (Myotis velifer) and pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus), with sequences in the latter 96.5% related to C. Mycoplasma haemohominis. We identified eight Bartonella genotypes, including those in cave myotis, with 96.7% similarity to C. Bartonella mayotimonensis. We also detected Bartonella rochalimae in migratory Tadarida brasiliensis, representing the first report of this human pathogen in bats. The seasonality and diversity of these bacteria observed here suggest that additional longitudinal, genomic, and immunological studies in bats are warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is growing interest to integrate conservation initiatives into agricultural practices using a reconciliation ecology framework. In Californias Central Valley, one approach to improving crucial nursery habitat for threatened and endangered fish species is by re-creating floodplain habitats through the inundation of agricultural fields during the non-growing season. We conducted a series of field experiments in agricultural floodplains (winter-flooded rice fields that were once natural floodplains) to explore whether different field preparation methods enhanced growth and survival of floodplain-dependent fish species. Approximately 8,000 juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared for at least 28 days on eight, 0.2 ha experimental fields. Each experimental field represented one of four treatments (two replicates per treatment): addition of large wood, addition of in-field canals, addition of both large wood and in-field canals, and control-where no additional field preparations were implemented beyond standard post-growing practices: i.e., chopping rice into stubble, baling and removing excess rice straw, and discing the field with a single pass by plowing rice straw into the ground to promote decomposition. We found no significant difference in water temperature, fish growth or fish survival among habitat treatments. Across treatments, survival ranged from 50.1%-78.3% and averaged 65.75% (/- 7.89% SE). These findings suggest agricultural floodplains require no additional modifications to promote fish growth and survival. Results illustrate the benefits of integrating working landscapes with conservation initiatives by creating more accessible and beneficial habitat for native fishes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Climate change is swiftly altering environmental winter conditions, leading to significant ecological impacts such as phenological shifts in many species. As a result, animals might face physiological mismatches due to longer or earlier activity periods and are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. Our study points for the first time to the complex physiological challenges that amphibians face as a result of changing thermal conditions due to winter climate change. We investigated the physiological responses to a period of warmer winter days and sudden spring freeze in the common toad (Bufo bufo) by acclimating them to 4{degrees}C or 8{degrees}C for 48 h or exposing them to 4{degrees}C or -2{degrees}C for 6 h, respectively. We assessed the daily energy demands, determined body condition and cold tolerance, explored the molecular responses to freezing through hepatic tissue transcriptome analysis, and measured blood glucose levels. Toads acclimated to higher temperatures showed a higher daily energy expenditure and a reduced cold tolerance suggesting faster depletion of energy stores and the loss of winter acclimation during warmer winters. Blood sugar levels were higher in frozen toads indicating the mobilization of cryoprotective glucose with freezing which was further supported by changed patterns in proteins related to glucose metabolism. Overall, our results emphasize that increased thermal variability incurs physiological costs that may reduce energy reserves and thus affect amphibian health and survival. This might pose a serious threat to breeding adults and may have subsequent effects at the population level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1. Species interactions are fundamental to the stability and productivity of ecosystems. To improve our capacity to predict and understand how climate change shapes the distribution of species and the dynamics of biotic interactions, we need to develop spatially explicit multi-species models that are built upon species-specific responses to changing conditions. 2. We developed a two-dimensional diffusion-advection-reaction predator-prey model that integrates species-specific responses to heterogeneous landscapes, affecting species dispersal, reproduction and survival rates. We derived conditions for the stability and feasibility of the coexistence steady-state and observed how temperature variation stabilises or destabilises the system. 3. We conducted numerical simulations to explore the effect of predicted extreme temperatures on the spatial dynamics of a parasitoid-butterfly system and their interactions. Applied to four different climatic environments, the numerical approximations demonstrate the asymmetric impact of a warming climate on interacting species. The output density distribution maps highlight the capability of our model to produce interpretable multiscale predictions which can be used to identify and evaluate species vulnerability locally and across their range. 4. By building upon a solid mechanistic understanding of species-specific responses to environmental change, our model can be extended to other species and variables, including environments where the availability of empirical data is limited, and explore the dynamics and distribution of interacting species under different scenarios of environmental change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species assigns species to discrete categories based on a common set of criteria to capture relative extinction risk. Some quantitative analyses require a continuous probability of extinction not provided by discrete categories. Furthermore, the criteria may not translate to extinction risk in a universal way across species, because some species attributes are not incorporated into the criteria. Here we calculate extinction risk using Markov Models parameterised with historical IUCN Red List assessment data, and we provide quantitative extinction risk for use in downstream analyses. We find that taxonomy, body size, and habitat specialism interact with extinction risk in ways not fully captured by the existing categories. For example, an Endangered habitat specialist appears equally at risk compared to a Critically Endangered habitat generalist. We hope our findings will support more accurate quantitative biodiversity analyses of species extinctions and declines using Red List data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Larval Lepidoptera gain survival advantages by aggregating, especially when combined with aposematic warning signals, yet reductions in predation risk may not be experienced equally across all group members. Hamiltons selfish herd theory predicts that larvae which surround themselves with their group mates should be at lower risk of predation, and those on the periphery of aggregations experience the greatest risk, yet this has rarely been tested. Here, we expose aggregations of artificial  caterpillar targets to predation from free-flying, wild birds to test for marginal predation when all prey are equally accessible, and for an interaction between warning colouration and marginal predation. We find that targets nearer the centre of the aggregation survived better than peripheral targets and nearby targets isolated from the group. However, there was no difference in survival between peripheral and isolated targets. We also find that grouped targets survived better than isolated targets when both are aposematic, but not when they are non-signalling. Our data suggest that avian predators preferentially target peripheral larvae from aggregations, and that prey warning signals enhance predator avoidance of groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Root exudation, the export of low-molecular weight organic carbon (C) from living plant roots to soil, influences microbial activity, nutrient availability, and ecosystem feedbacks to climate change, but the magnitude of this C flux at ecosystem and global scales is largely unknown. Here, we synthesize in situ measurements of root exudation rates and couple those to estimates of fine root biomass to estimate global and biome-level root exudate C fluxes. We estimate a global root exudate flux of 15.2 PgC y-1, or about 10% of global annual gross primary productivity. We found no differences in root mass-specific exudation rates among biomes, though total exudate fluxes are estimated to be greatest in grasslands owing to their high density of absorptive root biomass. Our synthesis highlights the global importance of root exudates in the terrestrial C cycle and identifies regions where more in situ measurements are needed to improve future estimates of root exudate C fluxes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos) are long-lived birds with pair bonds that may last many years. Pairs in Stillwater, OK, nested singly or in groups with up to 10 auxiliaries (Caffrey and Peterson 2015). Breeders did most of the nest building. Pair members contributed at approximately equal rates, although the sexes differed slightly in details: males tended to carry sticks and hand off materials more often, and females spent more time at and in nests. Both sexes worked faster on second and third attempts than on first attempts of the season. We found no evidence that pair members were (sexually) signaling to each other via their contributions. Incubation periods were characterized by low levels of activity at nests, where females spent most of their time and were fed once every 3-4 hours, mostly by their mates. Contributions to both stages of nesting by auxiliaries varied widely and exhibited no patterns with respect to any measured phenotypic characteristics.</p>
