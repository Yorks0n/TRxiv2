The recent proliferation of new methods offers new opportunities to understand how memory influences movement. However, there are no clear guidelines for practitioners wishing to parameterize the effects of memory on moving animals. C_LIO_LIWe review approaches for incorporating memory into Step-Selection Analyses (SSAs), a frequently used movement modeling framework. Memory-informed SSAs can be constructed by including spatial-temporal covariates (or maps) that define some aspect of familiarity (e.g., whether, how often, or how long ago the animal visited different spatial locations) derived from long-term telemetry data. C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate how various familiarity covariates can be included in SSAs using a series of coded examples in which we fit models to wildlife tracking data from a wide range of taxa. We discuss how these different approaches can be used to address questions related to whether and how animals use information from past experiences to inform their future movements. C_LIO_LIBy reviewing different approaches and providing code templates for their implementation, we hope to inspire practitioners to further investigate the importance of memory in animal movements using wildlife tracking data.

Yet the breeding ecology of Yellow-wattled Lapwing has received relatively little research attention despite the species widespread presence in the Indian subcontinent. The objective of this study was to investigate the significance and impact of two visual concealment strategies commonly utilized by open ground-nesting birds: visual concealment through vegetative characteristics and camouflage using Yellow-wattled Lapwing as the model organism. We also assessed the nest-site selection of Yellow-wattled Lapwings in relation to vegetation cover and food availability, as well as their choice of nest substrate by using behavioral sampling, quadrat sampling, and digital image analysis techniques. We found that variation in hatching success could not be attributed to the analyzed camouflage mechanisms (disruptive markings and pattern complexity matching). Furthermore, the nesting pairs exhibited a preference for areas with high vegetation cover and low food availability while selecting nesting sites. We also showed that this species might exhibit an active behavioral preference for selecting nest substrates. It is important to note that this study was conducted during a single nesting season for the Yellow-wattled Lapwings, and further temporal replicates are necessary to validate and establish the findings over the long term.\nSimulating animal space use from fitted integrated Step-Selection Functions (iSSF)\nAuthors: Signer, J.; Fieberg, J.; Reineking, B.; Schlaegel, U.; Smith, B. J.; Balkenhol, N.; Avgar, T.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552754\nO_LIA standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data. C_LIO_LIIntegrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths. C_LIO_LIHere, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package). C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity. C_LI\nMapping the landscape pool of ardeid species to landscape structure associated with Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia\nAuthors: Walsh, M.; Webb, C. E.; Brookes, V.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553798\nThe geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.\nIsland biogeography theory and the gut: why taller people tend to harbor more diverse gut microbiomes.\nAuthors: Ramos Sarmiento, K.; Carr, A.; Diener, C.; Locey, K. J.; Gibbons, S. M.\nScore: 29.8, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552554\nPrior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.\nPredicting forest damage using relative abundance of multiple deer species and national forest inventory data.\nAuthors: Brock, C.; Morera-Pujol, V.; Murphy, K. J.; Nieuwenhuis, M.; Ciuti, S.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553670\nHuman modification of landscape and natural resources have facilitated deer population irruptions across the world resulting in widespread human-wildlife conflicts. These conflicts occur across the field of natural resource management and negatively affect both the public and vested stakeholders when their livelihoods are placed at risk, for instance, the forestry sector. Deer, both native and non-native, at high densities can damage forest ecosystems impacting biodiversity and ecological functioning at multiple levels and can inflict large ecological and economic costs. The ecological drivers of forest damage and the roles of single and multiple co-occurring deer species is not well understood due to a lack of coordinated high resolution deer distribution, deer abundance and forest damage data. Here, we aim to disentangle the relationship between forest damage, forest characteristics and the roles deer play in damaging forest ecosystems. To achieve this, we adopt a novel approach integrating recent high resolution deer distribution data for multiple deer species (native and non-native) and combining them with forest inventory data collected in 1,681 sampling stations across Ireland to provide risk scenario predictions for practitioners to use on a national scale. Forest characteristics played a key role in the severity and type of damage risk that deer posed. We found all damage types were more prevalent in forests with greater tree densities where deer are more likely to find refuge from human disturbance. Bark stripping damage was more prevalent in mature forests with high tree diversity and ground level flora (e.g., bryophytes, herbs, and shrubs). Similarly, browsing damage was more prevalent in forests with greater tree richness but with understorey vegetation dominated by grass and ferns. Fraying damage was more common in mixed woodlands with understory dominated by bryophytes and grass. Crucially, we found that type and severity of forest damage were shaped by the interaction of multiple deer species occurring simultaneously, particularly at high densities, suggesting subtle inter-species competition and exclusion/partition dynamics that require further investigation to understand the ecological mechanism. Finally, we produce risk scenarios of forest damage by co-occurring deer species and precisely predict where damage is likely to occur on a national scale. We predict high levels of damage in sika and/or red deer hotspots, matching areas of highly concentrated deer distributions. This study highlights the ecological drivers and the role that co-occurring native and non-native deer species have on forest damage within a large spatial scale. By combining reliable species distribution models with the national forest inventory data, we can now provide a useful tool for practitioners to help alleviate and mitigate forest damage and human wildlife conflicts.\nFive years later, with double the demographic data, naked mole-rat mortality rates continue to defy Gompertzian laws by not increasing with age\nAuthors: Ruby, J. G.; Smith, M.; Buffenstein, R.\nScore: 30.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.27.534424\nThe naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a mouse-sized rodent species, notable for its eusociality and long lifespan. Previously, we reported that demographic aging, i.e., the exponential increase of mortality hazard that accompanies advancing age in mammals and other organisms, does not occur in naked mole-rats (Ruby et al, 2018). The demographic data supporting that conclusion had taken over three decades to accumulate, starting with the original rearing of H.glaber in captivity. In the five years following that study, we [~]doubled our quantity of demographic data. Here, we re-evaluated our prior conclusions in light of these new data and found them to be supported and indeed strengthened. We additionally provided insight into the social dynamics of captive H.glaber with data and analyses of body weight and colony size versus mortality. Finally, we provide a phylogenetically-proximal comparator in the form of lifespan data from our Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) colony and demographic meta-analysis of those data along with published data from Ansells mole-rat (Fukomys anselli). We found Fukomys mortality hazard to increase gradually with age, an observation with implications on the evolution of exceptional lifespan among mole-rats and the ecological factors that may have accompanied that evolution.\nBeing a tree crop increases the odds of experiencing yield declines irrespective of pollinator dependence\nAuthors: Aizen, M. A.; Gleiser, G.; Kitzberger, T. A.; Milla, R.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.27.538617\nCrop yields, i.e., harvestable production per unit of cropland area, are in decline for a number of crops and regions, but the drivers of this process are poorly known. Global decreases in pollinator abundance and diversity have been proposed as a major driver of yield declines in crops that depend on animals, mostly bees, to produce fruits and seeds. Alternatively, widespread tree mortality has been directly and indirectly related to global climate change, which could also explain yield decreases in tree crops. As tree crops are expected to be more dependent on pollinators than other crop types, disentangling the relative influence of growth form and pollinator dependence is relevant to identify the ultimate factors driving yield declines. Yield decline, defined here as a negative average annual yearly change in yield from 1961 to 2020, was measured in 4270 time series, involving 136 crops and 163 countries and territories. About one-fourth of all time series showed declines in crop yield, a characteristic associated with both high pollinator dependence and a tree growth form. Because pollinator dependence and plant growth form were partially correlated, we disentangled the effect of each of these two predictors using a series of generalized linear mixed models that evaluated direct and indirect associations. Our analyses revealed a stronger association of yield decline with growth form than with pollinator dependence, a relationship that persisted after partialling out the effect of pollinator dependence. In particular, yield declines were more common among tree than herbaceous and shrub crops in all major regions but in Africa, a continent showing a high incidence of yield declines irrespective of growth form. These results suggest that pollinator decline is not the main reason behind crop productivity loss, but that other factors such as climate change could be already affecting crop yield.\nEmerging Threat of Ranavirus: Prevalence, Genetic Diversity, and Climatic Drivers of Ranavirus (Family Iridoviridae) in ectothermic vertebrates of Asia\nAuthors: Herath, J.; Sun, D.; Ellepola, G.; Subramaniam, K.; Meegaskumbura, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553946\nRanavirus disease, caused by viruses within the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), is considered a globally emerging infectious disease linked to mass mortality events in both wild and cultured ectothermic vertebrates. Surveillance work is however limited in Asia, hence prevalence and the dynamics of the disease remains poorly understood. To understand disease burden and the potential biotic and abiotic drivers in southern China region, we conducted a systematic surveillance of the ranavirus across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region (GAR). For this, we used a multifaceted approach involving screening of amphibians and other potential reservoirs, diagnostic tests, phylogenetic analyses, prevalence estimation, co-infection assessments, and climatic niche analyses. Over one thousand individuals were sampled across 25 sampling sites. We found ninety two individuals from 18 species of ectothermic vertebrates to be infected with ranavirus. Two lineages were responsible: Rana nigromaculata ranavirus and Tiger frog virus were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) gene fragment. We also found evidence of a co-infection with ranavirus and Bd that can be highly detrimental to host populations; possibly the first such documentation in Asia. Our niche modelling analysis suggests that precipitation and seasonality play an important role in ranavirus prevalence in Guangxi region and southwestern, southeastern, central and northeastern regions of GAR can be considered to be optimum habitats for ranaviruses. Infection rates in wild frog species have reached 100% in some areas, even in nature reserves. Our research also indicates that culture facilities and pet farms are frequently infected, serving as likely vectors for the regional and global spread of ranaviruses. The knowledge generated suggests the need for systematic surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, and control of international animal trade to prevent further transmission and protection of biodiversity and aquaculture industries across Asia.\nClimate change should drive mammal defaunation in tropical dry forests\nAuthors: Moura, M. R.; Silva, G. A. O.; Paglia, A.; Pires, M. M.; Santos, B. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553094\nHuman-induced climate change has intensified negative impacts on socioeconomic factors, the environment, and biodiversity, including changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in global average temperatures. Drylands are particularly at risk, with projections suggesting they will become hotter, drier, and less suitable for a significant portion of their species, potentially leading to mammal defaunation. We use ecological niche modelling and community ecology biodiversity metrics to examine potential geographical range shifts of non-volant mammal species in the largest Neotropical dryland, the Caatinga, and evaluate impacts of climate change on mammal assemblages. According to projections, 85% of the mammal species will lose suitable habitats, with one quarter of species projected to completely lose suitable habitats by 2060. This will result in a decrease in species richness for more than 90% of assemblages and an increase in compositional similarity to nearby assemblages (i.e., reduction in spatial beta diversity) for 70% of the assemblages. Small-sized mammals will be the most impacted and lose most of their suitable habitats, especially in highlands. The scenario is even worse in the eastern half of Caatinga where habitat destruction already prevails, compounding the threats faced by species there. While species-specific responses can vary with respect to dispersal, behaviour, and energy requirements, our findings indicate that climate change can drive mammal assemblages to biotic homogenisation and species loss, with drastic changes in assemblage trophic structure. For successful long-term socioenvironmental policy and conservation planning, it is critical that findings from biodiversity forecasts are considered.\n",

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIncorporating memory (i.e., some notion of familiarity or experience with the landscape) into models of animal movement is a rising challenge in the field of movement ecology. The recent proliferation of new methods offers new opportunities to understand how memory influences movement. However, there are no clear guidelines for practitioners wishing to parameterize the effects of memory on moving animals.
C_LIO_LIWe review approaches for incorporating memory into Step-Selection Analyses (SSAs), a frequently used movement modeling framework. Memory-informed SSAs can be constructed by including spatial-temporal covariates (or maps) that define some aspect of familiarity (e.g., whether, how often, or how long ago the animal visited different spatial locations) derived from long-term telemetry data.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate how various familiarity covariates can be included in SSAs using a series of coded examples in which we fit models to wildlife tracking data from a wide range of taxa. We discuss how these different approaches can be used to address questions related to whether and how animals use information from past experiences to inform their future movements.
C_LIO_LIBy reviewing different approaches and providing code templates for their implementation, we hope to inspire practitioners to further investigate the importance of memory in animal movements using wildlife tracking data.

        <p class="abstract">Ground-nesting birds such as Yellow-wattled Lapwing, Vanellus malabaricus (Boddaert, 1783) employ several nesting and behavioral strategies to mitigate nest predation, which greatly influences their reproductive success and survival. Yet the breeding ecology of Yellow-wattled Lapwing has received relatively little research attention despite the species widespread presence in the Indian subcontinent. The objective of this study was to investigate the significance and impact of two visual concealment strategies commonly utilized by open ground-nesting birds: visual concealment through vegetative characteristics and camouflage using Yellow-wattled Lapwing as the model organism. We also assessed the nest-site selection of Yellow-wattled Lapwings in relation to vegetation cover and food availability, as well as their choice of nest substrate by using behavioral sampling, quadrat sampling, and digital image analysis techniques. We found that variation in hatching success could not be attributed to the analyzed camouflage mechanisms (disruptive markings and pattern complexity matching). Furthermore, the nesting pairs exhibited a preference for areas with high vegetation cover and low food availability while selecting nesting sites. We also showed that this species might exhibit an active behavioral preference for selecting nest substrates. It is important to note that this study was conducted during a single nesting season for the Yellow-wattled Lapwings, and further temporal replicates are necessary to validate and establish the findings over the long term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIA standing challenge in the study of animal movement ecology is the capacity to predict where and when an individual animal might occur on the landscape, the so-called, Utilization Distribution (UD). Under certain assumptions, the steady-state UD can be predicted from a fitted exponential habitat selection function. However, these assumptions are rarely met. Furthermore, there are many applications that require the estimation of transient dynamics rather than steady-state UDs (e.g. when modeling migration or dispersal). Thus, there is a clear need for computational tools capable of predicting UDs based on observed animal movement data.
C_LIO_LIIntegrated Step-Selection Analyses (iSSAs) are widely used to study habitat selection and movement of wild animals, and result in a fully parametrized individual-based model of animal movement, which we refer to as an integrated Step Selection Function (iSSF). An iSSF can be used to generate stochastic animal paths based on random draws from a series of Markovian redistribution kernels, each consisting of a selection-free, but possibly habitat-influenced, movement kernel and a movement-free selection function. The UD can be approximated by a sufficiently large set of such stochastic paths.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a set of functions in R to facilitate the simulation of animal space use from fitted iSSFs. Our goal is to provide a general purpose simulator that is easy to use and is part of an existing workflow for iSSAs (within the amt R package).
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate through a series of applications how the simulator can be used to address a variety of questions in applied movement ecology. By providing functions in amt and coded examples, we hope to encourage ecologists using iSSFs to explore their predictions and model goodness-of-fit using simulations, and to further explore mechanistic approaches to modeling landscape connectivity.

        <p class="abstract">The geographic extent of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a zoonotic, mosquito-borne virus, increased dramatically in south-eastern Australia over the summer of 2021-2022 resulting in outbreaks in piggeries, 45 cases of human disease, and simultaneous detection of JEV by mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs. Preliminary investigation of the landscape epidemiology of the piggery outbreaks showed that they were associated with particular landscape structure as well as intermediate ardeid species richness. However, no exploration of the ways in which individual species or species composition may couple with JEV-associated landscape composition and configuration has been undertaken and, therefore, key questions regarding the landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of JEV in Australia remain unanswered. The current study sought to interrogate how individual species presence and their functional traits were distributed across the landscape, and how these distributions aligned with the landscape structure of JEV occurrence. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process models and multivariate hierarchical models were used to investigate the landscape-level ardeid species pools and the distribution of their pool-weighted traits with respect to JEV outbreaks. The distributions of six species were strongly associated with the distribution of JEV outbreaks reported in 2022: Casmerodius albus (Ardea alba), Ardea pacifica, Botaurus poiciloptilus, Egretta novaehollandiae, Ixobrychus minutus (Ixobrychus dubius), and Nycticorax caledonicus. Some JEV-delimiting landscape features, including transient wetlands and proximity to waterways, were associated with the presence of nearly all ardeid species, while others, such as crop cultivation, habitat fragmentation, and water flow accumulation were associated with only a subset of these species. In addition, hand-wing index was associated with species presence in landscapes associated with JEV outbreaks, which may suggest the importance of dispersal capacity in ardeid community assembly in landscapes that share environmental features with JEV occurrence. This study provides a preliminary selection of target species for the development of wild waterbird JEV surveillance, while uniquely accounting for sympatry and the potential for functional modulation of environmental filtering in high-risk landscapes, despite the broad landscape scale that necessarily constrained the analysis. Nevertheless, while the results provide an actionable One Health framework with which to develop wildlife surveillance, it must be noted that they do not describe community assembly rules, nor do they provide a description of community composition at local scale. The findings advance the current understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in Australia by connecting landscapes with individual species from a family of established maintenance hosts and, given the large geographic extent of the potential circulation of JEV in maintenance hosts, provides valuable evidence-based information for targeted surveillance strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size and gut microbiome alpha-diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we show a similar scaling relationship between human height and gut microbiome alpha-diversity across two large, independent cohorts, controlling for a wide range of relevant covariates, such as body mass index, age, sex, and bowel movement frequency. Island Biogeography Theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for these positive SARs. Using an individual-based model of IBT adapted to the gut, we demonstrate that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem is associated with increased species diversity. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut Cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha-diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship appeared to be mediated by alpha-diversity. We also observed that vegetable consumption mitigated this risk increase, also by mediation through alpha-diversity. In summary, we find that body size and gut microbiome diversity show a robust positive association, that this macroecological scaling relationship is related to CDI risk, and that greater vegetable intake can mitigate this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human modification of landscape and natural resources have facilitated deer population irruptions across the world resulting in widespread human-wildlife conflicts. These conflicts occur across the field of natural resource management and negatively affect both the public and vested stakeholders when their livelihoods are placed at risk, for instance, the forestry sector. Deer, both native and non-native, at high densities can damage forest ecosystems impacting biodiversity and ecological functioning at multiple levels and can inflict large ecological and economic costs. The ecological drivers of forest damage and the roles of single and multiple co-occurring deer species is not well understood due to a lack of coordinated high resolution deer distribution, deer abundance and forest damage data. Here, we aim to disentangle the relationship between forest damage, forest characteristics and the roles deer play in damaging forest ecosystems. To achieve this, we adopt a novel approach integrating recent high resolution deer distribution data for multiple deer species (native and non-native) and combining them with forest inventory data collected in 1,681 sampling stations across Ireland to provide risk scenario predictions for practitioners to use on a national scale. Forest characteristics played a key role in the severity and type of damage risk that deer posed. We found all damage types were more prevalent in forests with greater tree densities where deer are more likely to find refuge from human disturbance. Bark stripping damage was more prevalent in mature forests with high tree diversity and ground level flora (e.g., bryophytes, herbs, and shrubs). Similarly, browsing damage was more prevalent in forests with greater tree richness but with understorey vegetation dominated by grass and ferns. Fraying damage was more common in mixed woodlands with understory dominated by bryophytes and grass. Crucially, we found that type and severity of forest damage were shaped by the interaction of multiple deer species occurring simultaneously, particularly at high densities, suggesting subtle inter-species competition and exclusion/partition dynamics that require further investigation to understand the ecological mechanism. Finally, we produce risk scenarios of forest damage by co-occurring deer species and precisely predict where damage is likely to occur on a national scale. We predict high levels of damage in sika and/or red deer hotspots, matching areas of highly concentrated deer distributions. This study highlights the ecological drivers and the role that co-occurring native and non-native deer species have on forest damage within a large spatial scale. By combining reliable species distribution models with the national forest inventory data, we can now provide a useful tool for practitioners to help alleviate and mitigate forest damage and human wildlife conflicts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a mouse-sized rodent species, notable for its eusociality and long lifespan. Previously, we reported that demographic aging, i.e., the exponential increase of mortality hazard that accompanies advancing age in mammals and other organisms, does not occur in naked mole-rats (Ruby et al, 2018). The demographic data supporting that conclusion had taken over three decades to accumulate, starting with the original rearing of H.glaber in captivity. In the five years following that study, we [~]doubled our quantity of demographic data. Here, we re-evaluated our prior conclusions in light of these new data and found them to be supported and indeed strengthened. We additionally provided insight into the social dynamics of captive H.glaber with data and analyses of body weight and colony size versus mortality. Finally, we provide a phylogenetically-proximal comparator in the form of lifespan data from our Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) colony and demographic meta-analysis of those data along with published data from Ansells mole-rat (Fukomys anselli). We found Fukomys mortality hazard to increase gradually with age, an observation with implications on the evolution of exceptional lifespan among mole-rats and the ecological factors that may have accompanied that evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crop yields, i.e., harvestable production per unit of cropland area, are in decline for a number of crops and regions, but the drivers of this process are poorly known. Global decreases in pollinator abundance and diversity have been proposed as a major driver of yield declines in crops that depend on animals, mostly bees, to produce fruits and seeds. Alternatively, widespread tree mortality has been directly and indirectly related to global climate change, which could also explain yield decreases in tree crops. As tree crops are expected to be more dependent on pollinators than other crop types, disentangling the relative influence of growth form and pollinator dependence is relevant to identify the ultimate factors driving yield declines. Yield decline, defined here as a negative average annual yearly change in yield from 1961 to 2020, was measured in 4270 time series, involving 136 crops and 163 countries and territories. About one-fourth of all time series showed declines in crop yield, a characteristic associated with both high pollinator dependence and a tree growth form. Because pollinator dependence and plant growth form were partially correlated, we disentangled the effect of each of these two predictors using a series of generalized linear mixed models that evaluated direct and indirect associations. Our analyses revealed a stronger association of yield decline with growth form than with pollinator dependence, a relationship that persisted after partialling out the effect of pollinator dependence. In particular, yield declines were more common among tree than herbaceous and shrub crops in all major regions but in Africa, a continent showing a high incidence of yield declines irrespective of growth form. These results suggest that pollinator decline is not the main reason behind crop productivity loss, but that other factors such as climate change could be already affecting crop yield.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ranavirus disease, caused by viruses within the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), is considered a globally emerging infectious disease linked to mass mortality events in both wild and cultured ectothermic vertebrates. Surveillance work is however limited in Asia, hence prevalence and the dynamics of the disease remains poorly understood. To understand disease burden and the potential biotic and abiotic drivers in southern China region, we conducted a systematic surveillance of the ranavirus across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region (GAR). For this, we used a multifaceted approach involving screening of amphibians and other potential reservoirs, diagnostic tests, phylogenetic analyses, prevalence estimation, co-infection assessments, and climatic niche analyses. Over one thousand individuals were sampled across 25 sampling sites. We found ninety two individuals from 18 species of ectothermic vertebrates to be infected with ranavirus. Two lineages were responsible: Rana nigromaculata ranavirus and Tiger frog virus were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) gene fragment. We also found evidence of a co-infection with ranavirus and Bd that can be highly detrimental to host populations; possibly the first such documentation in Asia. Our niche modelling analysis suggests that precipitation and seasonality play an important role in ranavirus prevalence in Guangxi region and southwestern, southeastern, central and northeastern regions of GAR can be considered to be optimum habitats for ranaviruses. Infection rates in wild frog species have reached 100% in some areas, even in nature reserves. Our research also indicates that culture facilities and pet farms are frequently infected, serving as likely vectors for the regional and global spread of ranaviruses. The knowledge generated suggests the need for systematic surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, and control of international animal trade to prevent further transmission and protection of biodiversity and aquaculture industries across Asia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human-induced climate change has intensified negative impacts on socioeconomic factors, the environment, and biodiversity, including changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in global average temperatures. Drylands are particularly at risk, with projections suggesting they will become hotter, drier, and less suitable for a significant portion of their species, potentially leading to mammal defaunation. We use ecological niche modelling and community ecology biodiversity metrics to examine potential geographical range shifts of non-volant mammal species in the largest Neotropical dryland, the Caatinga, and evaluate impacts of climate change on mammal assemblages. According to projections, 85% of the mammal species will lose suitable habitats, with one quarter of species projected to completely lose suitable habitats by 2060. This will result in a decrease in species richness for more than 90% of assemblages and an increase in compositional similarity to nearby assemblages (i.e., reduction in spatial beta diversity) for 70% of the assemblages. Small-sized mammals will be the most impacted and lose most of their suitable habitats, especially in highlands. The scenario is even worse in the eastern half of Caatinga where habitat destruction already prevails, compounding the threats faced by species there. While species-specific responses can vary with respect to dispersal, behaviour, and energy requirements, our findings indicate that climate change can drive mammal assemblages to biotic homogenisation and species loss, with drastic changes in assemblage trophic structure. For successful long-term socioenvironmental policy and conservation planning, it is critical that findings from biodiversity forecasts are considered.</p>
