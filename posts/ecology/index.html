To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.\nPatterns and correlates in the distribution, design and management of garden ponds along an urban-rural gradient\nAuthors: Hamer, A. J.; Barta, B.; Marton, Z.; Vad, C. F.; Szabo, B.; Tornero, I.; Horvath, Z.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569344\nUrbanisation results in the loss and alteration of natural wetlands and ponds. However, garden ponds in cities and towns can act as rich reservoirs of aquatic biodiversity and stepping stones for dispersal. Homeowners with a range of different motivations, including biodiversity values, install garden ponds. Here, our main aim was to study whether the design and management choices of garden pond owners was dependent on the location of ponds (capital city vs. countryside), when ponds were installed (pond age), or whether fish were introduced. We surveyed 834 garden pond owners across Hungary using a citizen science questionnaire, asking questions on pond size, location, construction date and materials, vegetation structure, introduction of fish and management practices. From 753 validated responses, we found that the introduction of fish into ponds and high urbanisation were strongly associated with local features and management practices, especially large ponds with a water circulation feature, irrespective of pond age. A typical garden pond in Hungary is [~]20 m2, \u003c10 years old, made of rubber (PVC) lining, contains fish, aquatic vegetation and circulating water, and is actively managed. There was a spatial separation of ponds based on local features between ponds in the capital city (Budapest) and elsewhere. These findings suggest that garden pond owners in cities are likely to make different choices in pond design and management compared to owners in regional areas. Our results also suggest that pond owners may primarily select management practices to improve habitat quality for ornamental fish. Our findings have important implications for maintaining aquatic biodiversity in urban areas, where garden ponds may be the only aquatic habitat available.

Here, we experimentally tested the performance of passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity by establishing 52 tree islands in an oil palm landscape. Tree diversity via natural regeneration was shaped by local rather than landscape properties, with the diversity of planted tree species and tree island size driving higher multifaceted diversity. We show that large tree islands with higher initial planted diversity catalyze the recovery of multifaceted diversity at both the local and landscape level, including forest-associated species. Our results demonstrate that planted diversity begets regenerating diversity, overcoming major limitations of natural regeneration in highly modified landscapes. By elucidating the contribution of experimental, local, and landscape drivers to natural regeneration, these findings provide practical insights to make oil palm landscapes more biodiversity-friendly by enhancing functional and phylogenetic diversity within plantations.\nModeling Tick Populations: An Ecological Test Case forGradient Boosted Trees\nAuthors: Manley, W.; Tran, T.; Prusinski, M.; Brisson, D.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.13.532443\nGeneral linear models have been the foundational statistical framework used to discover the ecological processes that explain the distribution and abundance of natural populations. Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to result in accurate predictions of the distribution and abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous assessments of the theoretical advantages of these methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to identify environmental features that explain observed variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient boosted and linear models use similar environmental features to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted models found non-linear relationships and interactions that are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional model types that provide practical advantages for tick surveillance and public health. The results highlight the potential of gradient boosted models to discover novel ecological phenomena affecting pathogen demography and as a powerful public health tool to mitigate disease risks.\nDo you have enough space? Habitat selection of insectivorous cave-dwelling bats in fragmented landscapes of Eastern Amazon\nAuthors: Tavares, V. d. C.; Ribeiro, M. S.; Prous, X.; Notini, A. A.; Kaku-Oliveira, N. Y.; Maciel, L. M. D.; Sales, S.; Longo, J. M.; Evangelista, F. M.; Rabelo, L.; Brandi, I.; Vasconcelos, S. S.; Talamoni, S. S.; Oliveira, G.; Trevelin, L. C.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570662\nIndividual movements of bats result from a compromise between their recognition of the environment and their potential to fulfill bats life requirements, and to the potential threats associated with moving, all of this is mediated by habitat selection. Mining activities produce modifications to the environments that add heterogeneity and fragmentation to the landscapes used by bats, with overall poorly understood consequences to their movements and to the underground-related biodiversity. Cave dwelling bats spend a large part of their life cycle within their roosts, and they are of paramount importance to the subterranean biodiversity because of their constant movements between the external landscapes, which they selectively use, and the underground ecosystems, where they usually apport energy in form of organic matter. We investigated the variation of patterns of habitat use and selection by cave-dwelling bats in a mosaic of disturbed and conserved Eastern Amazonian forests and rupestrian iron-rich savannas (cangas) interspersed in an extensive iron-caves system. We studied the movements of two phylogenetically distant related insectivores, the aerial insect-catcher Furipterus horrens (Furipteridae) and the foliage gleaning bat Lonchorhina aurita (Phyllostomidae), both cave-dependent in the study area, one of them categorized as threatened to extinction in Brazil, and virtually unknown in terms of their movement behavior, and habitat use. We used radio telemetry to assess habitat use, under the prediction that these species prefer natural and conserved habitats for their foraging bouts, avoiding human-modified habitats. We also anticipated larger range-areas and commuting distances for both species when foraging in disturbed landscapes. Thirty-one bats were monitored in different landscapes (conserved Amazonian ombrophilous forests and cangas, mining sites and pasture) resulting in an average range of 346.9 {+/-} 762.5 ha and an average commuting distance of 1921.5 {+/-} 2269.7 m for F. horrens and of 716.8 {+/-} 1000.6 ha and 2582.2 {+/-} 1966.0 m for L. aurita. Our habitat selection analyses suggest that Furipterus horrens is an open space forager, with individuals frequently recorded foraging in cangas, and L. aurita is a forest forager, although using all habitats proportionally to their availability in the landscape. We did not detect landscape-related effects to the use of space by both species, whereas seasonal variation emerged as a relevant effect. This is the first time that movement data for F. horrens and L. aurita is presented. Our study delivers original baseline data on movement behavior and conservation of these threatened cave-dwelling bat species with virtually unknown biology and shed light into constraints related to the optimal and adjusted biological cycles of the bats and their range areas under scenarios of disturbance.\nEffects of urbanisation, habitat characteristics, and management on garden pond biodiversity: a citizen science approach\nAuthors: Marton, Z.; Barta, B.; Vad, C. F.; Szabo, B.; Hamer, A. J.; Kardos, V.; Laskai, C.; Fierpasz, A.; Horvath, Z.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570789\nThe rapid expansion of urban areas leads to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of natural habitats, posing a serious threat to biodiversity. While urban ponds might contribute substantially to the biodiversity of urban blue-green infrastructure, the role of garden ponds, one of their most numerous representatives, is still little known. We lack a comprehensive understanding of how local habitat features, different forms of management, and urbanisation might impact the biodiversity of these habitats. This study aimed to reveal the importance of garden ponds via a country-wide online citizen science survey in Hungary, Central Europe. Based on data from over 800 pond owners, we gained knowledge about the prevalence and local frequency of various native animal groups, including amphibians, odonates, and birds, as well as information regarding introduced animals, such as fish. Additionally, we collected data about pond features and management practices. We tested the effect of pond features, pond management, and landscape-level drivers (urbanisation, surrounding wetland coverage) on the presence of conspicuous animal groups (adult amphibians, birds, odonates, and tadpoles) along with species of adult amphibians to identify the potential drivers of the biodiversity of garden ponds. Key pond features like pond age, area, aquatic and shoreline vegetation were the most important factors, while algaecide addition was the most influential management practice negatively affecting the presence of amphibians. Urbanisation had a negative effect on the presence of adult amphibians and their tadpoles, but surprisingly, it was not negatively associated with the presence of odonates and birds. Our results demonstrate the vital role of garden ponds in urban biodiversity conservation, most notably by providing secondary habitats and contributing to amphibian conservation, as evidenced by the occurrence of 13 species. Emphasizing public involvement is key in developing effective urban biodiversity conservation strategies and recognizing citizens' potential contributions to a better functioning blue-green infrastructure.\nA regional One Health approach to the risk of invasion by Anopheles stephensi in Mauritius\nAuthors: Iyaloo, D. P.; Zohdy, S.; Carney, R.; Mosawa, V. R.; Elahee, K. B.; Carter, T.; Bhoobun, H.; Spear, J.; Munglee, N.; Latchooman, N.; Puryag, S.; Bheecarry, A.; Bedja, S. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570234\nBackground: Anopheles stephensi is an invasive malaria vector in Africa that threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa and is at risk of introduction due to this connectivity. For early detection of An. stephensi, the Vector Biology and Control Division under the Ministry of Health in Mauritius, leveraged a well-established Aedes program, as An. stephensi is known to share Aedes habitats. These efforts triggered multisectoral coordination and cascading benefits of integrated vector and One Health approaches. Methods: Beginning June 2021, entomological surveys were conducted at points of entry (seaport, airport) and on ships transporting livestock in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Department, the Mauritian Port Authority and National Veterinary Services. A total of 39, 18, 723 mosquito larval surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and other localities in Mauritius while 20, two and 26 adult mosquito surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and twenty-six animal points. Alongside adult mosquito surveys, surveillance of vectors of veterinary importance (e.g.- Culicoides spp.) was also carried out in collaboration with National Parks and Conservation Service and land owners. Results: A total of 8,428 adult mosquitoes were collected and 1,844 larval habitats were positive for mosquitoes. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified and 151 Anopheles and 339 Aedes mosquitoes were also molecularly characterized. Mosquito species detected were Aedes albopictus, Anopheles arabiensis, An. coustani, An. merus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. thalassius and Lutzia tigripes. Anopheles stephensi was not detected. The One Health approach was shared with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), strengthening collaboration between Mauritius and Reunion Island on vector surveillance at entry points and insecticide resistance monitoring. The Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) was also alerted to the risk of An. stephensi, leading to regional efforts supporting trainings and development of a response strategy to An. stephensi bringing together stakeholders from Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Conclusions: Mauritius is a model system showing how existing public health entomology capabilities can be used to enhance vector surveillance and control and create multisectoral networks to respond to any emerging public and veterinary health vector-borne disease threat.\nTemperature dependence of mosquitoes: comparing mechanistic and machine learning approaches\nAuthors: Athni, T.; Childs, M.; Glidden, C. K.; Mordecai, E. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569955\nMosquito vectors of pathogens (e.g., Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex spp. which transmit dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, malaria, and others) are of increasing concern for global public health. These vectors are geographically shifting under climate and other anthropogenic changes. As small-bodied ectotherms, mosquitoes are strongly affected by temperature, which causes unimodal responses in mosquito life history traits (e.g., biting rate, adult mortality rate, mosquito development rate, and probability of egg-to-adult survival) that exhibit upper and lower thermal limits and intermediate thermal optima in laboratory studies. However, it remains unknown how mosquito thermal responses measured in laboratory experiments relate to the realized thermal responses of mosquitoes in the field. To address this gap, we leverage thousands of global mosquito occurrences and geospatial satellite data at high spatial resolution to construct machine-learning based species distribution models, from which vector thermal responses are estimated. We apply methods to restrict models to the relevant mosquito activity season and to conduct ecologically-plausible spatial background sampling centered around ecoregions for comparison to mosquito occurrence records. We found that thermal minima estimated from laboratory studies were highly correlated with those from the species distributions (r = 0.90). The thermal optima were less strongly correlated (r = 0.69). For most species, we did not detect thermal maxima from their observed distributions so were unable to compare to laboratory-based estimates. The results suggest that laboratory studies have the potential to be highly transportable to predicting lower thermal limits and thermal optima of mosquitoes in the field. At the same time, lab-based models likely capture physiological limits on mosquito persistence at high temperatures that are not apparent from field-based observational studies but may critically determine mosquito responses to climate warming.\nInvasive traits of freshwater fish database (ITOFF)\nAuthors: Jessop, A.; Michalopoulou, A.; Coonan, C.; Mazzei, L.; Sutherland O'Brien, E.; Brady, G.; Davison, C.; Gourlay, W.; Henderson, E.; Lornie, A.; McCloskey, E.; Ramsay, H.; Wilson, S.; Shimadzu, H.; Barbosa, M.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567195\nAIMSpecies invasions are a major driver of global biodiversity loss, but only a minority of invasions are successful. Evidence suggests that invasive success is linked to life-history traits. Yet, data on invasive success and species traits remain fragmented across multiple sources. Here we present the Invasive Traits of Freshwater Fish (ITOFF) database, an interdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple datasets to elucidate the role of life-history traits in shaping invasive success. ITOFF allows seamless access to invasive species data and fosters collaborative actions through knowledge sharing. ITOFF is supported by an innovative web-application that makes complex relationships between invasive and native species accessible to a broad audience. The scientific contribution of ITOFF is illustrated by examining the role of life-history traits and phylogeny in invasion success. LOCATIONGlobal. METHODSGeneralized linear models were used to test the contribution of generation time, trophic level, longevity, and temperature range to invasive success. Through divisive cluster analysis we investigate the role of multiple traits in determining invasive success. Finally, we construct phylogenetic trees to investigate the role of evolutionary history in the invasion process. RESULTSITOFF unifies data for 1917 freshwater fish species representative of invasive species, those species they endanger, and species impacted by invasives but not considered endangered. Invasive species are generally characterized by greater temperature ranges, but are indistinguishable from impacted, endangered, and critically endangered species for the remaining life-history traits. Further, we show that invasive species are generally not distinct from impacted or endangered species when considering multiple traits or phylogeny. MAIN CONCLUSIONSITOFF provides an accessible platform for the improved forecasting of species invasions. ITOFF data shows that classical predictions of life-history traits determining invasive success do not hold amongst freshwater fish species. Forecasting of invasive species must therefore shift towards a wholistic approach encompassing the species and the environment.\nSpecies-level classification provides new insights into the biogeographical patterns of microbial communities in shallow saline lakes\nAuthors: Len, P.; Meirkhanova, A.; Nugumanova, G.; Cestaro, A.; Jeppesen, E.; Vorobjev, I. A.; Donati, C.; Barteneva, N. S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570325\nSaline lakes are rapidly drying out across the globe, particularly in Central Asia, due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. We present the results of a long-read next generation sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA-based taxonomic structure of bacteriomes of the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn lakes system. We found that the shallow endorheic, mostly saline lakes of the system show unusually low bacterioplankton dispersal rates at species-level taxonomic resolution. The major environmental factor structuring the lakes microbial communities was salinity. The dominant bacterial phyla of the lakes with high salinity included a significant proportion of marine and halophilic species. In sum, these results, which can be applied to other lake systems of the semi-arid regions, improve our understanding of the factors influencing lake microbiomes undergoing salinization in response to climate change and other anthropogenic factors. Our results show that finer taxonomic classification can provide new insights and improve our understanding of the environmental factors influencing the microbiomes of lakes undergoing salinization in response to climate change and other anthropogenic factors.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urbanisation results in the loss and alteration of natural wetlands and ponds. However, garden ponds in cities and towns can act as rich reservoirs of aquatic biodiversity and stepping stones for dispersal. Homeowners with a range of different motivations, including biodiversity values, install garden ponds. Here, our main aim was to study whether the design and management choices of garden pond owners was dependent on the location of ponds (capital city vs. countryside), when ponds were installed (pond age), or whether fish were introduced. We surveyed 834 garden pond owners across Hungary using a citizen science questionnaire, asking questions on pond size, location, construction date and materials, vegetation structure, introduction of fish and management practices. From 753 validated responses, we found that the introduction of fish into ponds and high urbanisation were strongly associated with local features and management practices, especially large ponds with a water circulation feature, irrespective of pond age. A typical garden pond in Hungary is [~]20 m2, &lt;10 years old, made of rubber (PVC) lining, contains fish, aquatic vegetation and circulating water, and is actively managed. There was a spatial separation of ponds based on local features between ponds in the capital city (Budapest) and elsewhere. These findings suggest that garden pond owners in cities are likely to make different choices in pond design and management compared to owners in regional areas. Our results also suggest that pond owners may primarily select management practices to improve habitat quality for ornamental fish. Our findings have important implications for maintaining aquatic biodiversity in urban areas, where garden ponds may be the only aquatic habitat available.

        <p class="abstract">Optimizing restoration outcomes is crucial for enhancing multifaceted diversity, resilience, and ecosystem functioning in monoculture-dominated landscapes globally. Here, we experimentally tested the performance of passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity by establishing 52 tree islands in an oil palm landscape. Tree diversity via natural regeneration was shaped by local rather than landscape properties, with the diversity of planted tree species and tree island size driving higher multifaceted diversity. We show that large tree islands with higher initial planted diversity catalyze the recovery of multifaceted diversity at both the local and landscape level, including forest-associated species. Our results demonstrate that planted diversity begets regenerating diversity, overcoming major limitations of natural regeneration in highly modified landscapes. By elucidating the contribution of experimental, local, and landscape drivers to natural regeneration, these findings provide practical insights to make oil palm landscapes more biodiversity-friendly by enhancing functional and phylogenetic diversity within plantations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">General linear models have been the foundational statistical framework used to discover the ecological processes that explain the distribution and abundance of natural populations. Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to result in accurate predictions of the distribution and abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous assessments of the theoretical advantages of these methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to identify environmental features that explain observed variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient boosted and linear models use similar environmental features to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted models found non-linear relationships and interactions that are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional model types that provide practical advantages for tick surveillance and public health. The results highlight the potential of gradient boosted models to discover novel ecological phenomena affecting pathogen demography and as a powerful public health tool to mitigate disease risks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual movements of bats result from a compromise between their recognition of the environment and their potential to fulfill bats life requirements, and to the potential threats associated with moving, all of this is mediated by habitat selection. Mining activities produce modifications to the environments that add heterogeneity and fragmentation to the landscapes used by bats, with overall poorly understood consequences to their movements and to the underground-related biodiversity. Cave dwelling bats spend a large part of their life cycle within their roosts, and they are of paramount importance to the subterranean biodiversity because of their constant movements between the external landscapes, which they selectively use, and the underground ecosystems, where they usually apport energy in form of organic matter. We investigated the variation of patterns of habitat use and selection by cave-dwelling bats in a mosaic of disturbed and conserved Eastern Amazonian forests and rupestrian iron-rich savannas (cangas) interspersed in an extensive iron-caves system. We studied the movements of two phylogenetically distant related insectivores, the aerial insect-catcher Furipterus horrens (Furipteridae) and the foliage gleaning bat Lonchorhina aurita (Phyllostomidae), both cave-dependent in the study area, one of them categorized as threatened to extinction in Brazil, and virtually unknown in terms of their movement behavior, and habitat use. We used radio telemetry to assess habitat use, under the prediction that these species prefer natural and conserved habitats for their foraging bouts, avoiding human-modified habitats. We also anticipated larger range-areas and commuting distances for both species when foraging in disturbed landscapes. Thirty-one bats were monitored in different landscapes (conserved Amazonian ombrophilous forests and cangas, mining sites and pasture) resulting in an average range of 346.9 {&#43;/-} 762.5 ha and an average commuting distance of 1921.5 {&#43;/-} 2269.7 m for F. horrens and of 716.8 {&#43;/-} 1000.6 ha and 2582.2 {&#43;/-} 1966.0 m for L. aurita. Our habitat selection analyses suggest that Furipterus horrens is an open space forager, with individuals frequently recorded foraging in cangas, and L. aurita is a forest forager, although using all habitats proportionally to their availability in the landscape. We did not detect landscape-related effects to the use of space by both species, whereas seasonal variation emerged as a relevant effect. This is the first time that movement data for F. horrens and L. aurita is presented. Our study delivers original baseline data on movement behavior and conservation of these threatened cave-dwelling bat species with virtually unknown biology and shed light into constraints related to the optimal and adjusted biological cycles of the bats and their range areas under scenarios of disturbance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rapid expansion of urban areas leads to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of natural habitats, posing a serious threat to biodiversity. While urban ponds might contribute substantially to the biodiversity of urban blue-green infrastructure, the role of garden ponds, one of their most numerous representatives, is still little known. We lack a comprehensive understanding of how local habitat features, different forms of management, and urbanisation might impact the biodiversity of these habitats. This study aimed to reveal the importance of garden ponds via a country-wide online citizen science survey in Hungary, Central Europe. Based on data from over 800 pond owners, we gained knowledge about the prevalence and local frequency of various native animal groups, including amphibians, odonates, and birds, as well as information regarding introduced animals, such as fish. Additionally, we collected data about pond features and management practices. We tested the effect of pond features, pond management, and landscape-level drivers (urbanisation, surrounding wetland coverage) on the presence of conspicuous animal groups (adult amphibians, birds, odonates, and tadpoles) along with species of adult amphibians to identify the potential drivers of the biodiversity of garden ponds. Key pond features like pond age, area, aquatic and shoreline vegetation were the most important factors, while algaecide addition was the most influential management practice negatively affecting the presence of amphibians. Urbanisation had a negative effect on the presence of adult amphibians and their tadpoles, but surprisingly, it was not negatively associated with the presence of odonates and birds. Our results demonstrate the vital role of garden ponds in urban biodiversity conservation, most notably by providing secondary habitats and contributing to amphibian conservation, as evidenced by the occurrence of 13 species. Emphasizing public involvement is key in developing effective urban biodiversity conservation strategies and recognizing citizens&#39; potential contributions to a better functioning blue-green infrastructure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Anopheles stephensi is an invasive malaria vector in Africa that threatens to put an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria if it continues to spread. The island nation of Mauritius is highly connected to Asia and Africa and is at risk of introduction due to this connectivity. For early detection of An. stephensi, the Vector Biology and Control Division under the Ministry of Health in Mauritius, leveraged a well-established Aedes program, as An. stephensi is known to share Aedes habitats. These efforts triggered multisectoral coordination and cascading benefits of integrated vector and One Health approaches. Methods: Beginning June 2021, entomological surveys were conducted at points of entry (seaport, airport) and on ships transporting livestock in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Department, the Mauritian Port Authority and National Veterinary Services. A total of 39, 18, 723 mosquito larval surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and other localities in Mauritius while 20, two and 26 adult mosquito surveys were respectively conducted in the seaport, airport and twenty-six animal points. Alongside adult mosquito surveys, surveillance of vectors of veterinary importance (e.g.- Culicoides spp.) was also carried out in collaboration with National Parks and Conservation Service and land owners. Results: A total of 8,428 adult mosquitoes were collected and 1,844 larval habitats were positive for mosquitoes. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified and 151 Anopheles and 339 Aedes mosquitoes were also molecularly characterized. Mosquito species detected were Aedes albopictus, Anopheles arabiensis, An. coustani, An. merus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. thalassius and Lutzia tigripes. Anopheles stephensi was not detected. The One Health approach was shared with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), strengthening collaboration between Mauritius and Reunion Island on vector surveillance at entry points and insecticide resistance monitoring. The Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) was also alerted to the risk of An. stephensi, leading to regional efforts supporting trainings and development of a response strategy to An. stephensi bringing together stakeholders from Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Conclusions: Mauritius is a model system showing how existing public health entomology capabilities can be used to enhance vector surveillance and control and create multisectoral networks to respond to any emerging public and veterinary health vector-borne disease threat.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquito vectors of pathogens (e.g., Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex spp. which transmit dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, malaria, and others) are of increasing concern for global public health. These vectors are geographically shifting under climate and other anthropogenic changes. As small-bodied ectotherms, mosquitoes are strongly affected by temperature, which causes unimodal responses in mosquito life history traits (e.g., biting rate, adult mortality rate, mosquito development rate, and probability of egg-to-adult survival) that exhibit upper and lower thermal limits and intermediate thermal optima in laboratory studies. However, it remains unknown how mosquito thermal responses measured in laboratory experiments relate to the realized thermal responses of mosquitoes in the field. To address this gap, we leverage thousands of global mosquito occurrences and geospatial satellite data at high spatial resolution to construct machine-learning based species distribution models, from which vector thermal responses are estimated. We apply methods to restrict models to the relevant mosquito activity season and to conduct ecologically-plausible spatial background sampling centered around ecoregions for comparison to mosquito occurrence records. We found that thermal minima estimated from laboratory studies were highly correlated with those from the species distributions (r = 0.90). The thermal optima were less strongly correlated (r = 0.69). For most species, we did not detect thermal maxima from their observed distributions so were unable to compare to laboratory-based estimates. The results suggest that laboratory studies have the potential to be highly transportable to predicting lower thermal limits and thermal optima of mosquitoes in the field. At the same time, lab-based models likely capture physiological limits on mosquito persistence at high temperatures that are not apparent from field-based observational studies but may critically determine mosquito responses to climate warming.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AIMSpecies invasions are a major driver of global biodiversity loss, but only a minority of invasions are successful. Evidence suggests that invasive success is linked to life-history traits. Yet, data on invasive success and species traits remain fragmented across multiple sources. Here we present the Invasive Traits of Freshwater Fish (ITOFF) database, an interdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple datasets to elucidate the role of life-history traits in shaping invasive success. ITOFF allows seamless access to invasive species data and fosters collaborative actions through knowledge sharing. ITOFF is supported by an innovative web-application that makes complex relationships between invasive and native species accessible to a broad audience. The scientific contribution of ITOFF is illustrated by examining the role of life-history traits and phylogeny in invasion success.

LOCATIONGlobal.

METHODSGeneralized linear models were used to test the contribution of generation time, trophic level, longevity, and temperature range to invasive success. Through divisive cluster analysis we investigate the role of multiple traits in determining invasive success. Finally, we construct phylogenetic trees to investigate the role of evolutionary history in the invasion process.

RESULTSITOFF unifies data for 1917 freshwater fish species representative of invasive species, those species they endanger, and species impacted by invasives but not considered endangered. Invasive species are generally characterized by greater temperature ranges, but are indistinguishable from impacted, endangered, and critically endangered species for the remaining life-history traits. Further, we show that invasive species are generally not distinct from impacted or endangered species when considering multiple traits or phylogeny.

MAIN CONCLUSIONSITOFF provides an accessible platform for the improved forecasting of species invasions. ITOFF data shows that classical predictions of life-history traits determining invasive success do not hold amongst freshwater fish species. Forecasting of invasive species must therefore shift towards a wholistic approach encompassing the species and the environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Saline lakes are rapidly drying out across the globe, particularly in Central Asia, due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. We present the results of a long-read next generation sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA-based taxonomic structure of bacteriomes of the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn lakes system. We found that the shallow endorheic, mostly saline lakes of the system show unusually low bacterioplankton dispersal rates at species-level taxonomic resolution. The major environmental factor structuring the lakes microbial communities was salinity. The dominant bacterial phyla of the lakes with high salinity included a significant proportion of marine and halophilic species. In sum, these results, which can be applied to other lake systems of the semi-arid regions, improve our understanding of the factors influencing lake microbiomes undergoing salinization in response to climate change and other anthropogenic factors. Our results show that finer taxonomic classification can provide new insights and improve our understanding of the environmental factors influencing the microbiomes of lakes undergoing salinization in response to climate change and other anthropogenic factors.</p>
