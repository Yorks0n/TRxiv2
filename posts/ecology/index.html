Depending on their level of specialization, these symbiotic animals are characterized by distinct behavioural, chemical, and morphological traits that enable close heterospecific interactions. Despite its functional importance, our understanding of the feeding ecology of specialized animals living with social hosts remains limited. C_LIO_LIIn this study, we examined how host specialization of silverfish co-habiting with ants affects several components of their feeding ecology. We combined stable isotope profiling, feeding assays, phylogenetic reconstruction, and microbial community characterization of the Neoasterolepisma silverfish genus and a wider nicoletiid and lepismatid silverfish panel where divergent myrmecophilous lifestyles are observed. C_LIO_LIStable isotope profiling ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) showed that the isotopic niches (proxy for trophic niches) of granivorous Messor ants and Messor-specialized Neoasterolepisma exhibit a remarkable overlap within an ant nest. Trophic experiments and gut dissections further supported that these specialized Neoasterolepisma silverfish transitioned to a diet that includes plant seeds. In contrast, the isotopic niches of generalist Neoasterolepisma silverfish and generalist nicoletiid silverfish were clearly different from their ant hosts within the shared nest environment. C_LIO_LIThe impact of the myrmecophilous lifestyle on feeding ecology was also evident in the internal silverfish microbiome. Compared to generalists, Messor-specialists exhibited a higher bacterial density and a higher proportion of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Moreover, the nest environment explained the infection profile (or the 16S rRNA genotypes) of Weissella bacteria in Messor-specialized silverfish and the ant hosts. C_LIO_LITogether, we show that social hosts are important determinants for the feeding ecology of symbiotic animals, and can induce diet convergence.

M.; Schunter, C.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567130\nOcean acidification (OA) has numerous impacts on marine organisms including behaviour. While behaviours are controlled in the neuro system, its complexity makes linking behavioural impairments to environmental change difficult. Here we use a neurological model Aplysia californica with well-studied simple neuro system and behaviours. By exposing Aplysia to current day ([~]500 {micro}atm) or near-future CO2 conditions ([~]1100 {micro}atm), we test the effect of OA on their tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) and the underlying neuromolecular response of the pleural-pedal ganglia, responsible for the behaviour. Under OA, Aplysia relax tails faster due to increased sensorin-A expression, an inhibitor of mechanosensory neurons. We further investigate how OA affects habituation, which produced a \"sensitization-like\" behaviour and affected vesicle transport and stress response, revealing an influence of OA on neuronal and behavioural outputs associated with learning. Finally, we test whether GABA-mediated neurotransmission is involved in impaired TWR, but exposure to gabazine did not restore normal behaviour and provoked little molecular response, rejecting the involvement in TWR impairment. Instead, vesicular transport and cellular signalling link other neurotransmitter processes directly with TWR impairment. Our study shows effects of OA on neurological tissue parts that control for behaviour revealing the neurological mechanisms when faced with OA.\nHost-microbiome mutualisms emerge from community interactions among microbes\nAuthors: Laurich, J. R.; Lash, E.; Frederickson, M. E.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567078\nMicrobiomes often benefit plants, conferring resistance to pathogens, improving stress tolerance, or promoting plant growth. As potential plant mutualists, however, microbiomes are not a single organism but a community of species with complex interactions among microbial taxa and between microbes and their shared host. The nature of ecological interactions among microbes in the microbiome can have important consequences for the net effects of microbiomes on hosts. Here, we compared the effects of individual microbial strains and 10-strain synthetic communities on microbial productivity and host growth using the common duckweed Lemna minor and a synthetic, simplified version of its native microbiome. Except for Pseudomonas protegens, which was a mutualist when tested alone, all of the single strains we tested were commensals on hosts, benefiting from plant presence but not increasing host growth relative to uninoculated controls. However, 10-strain synthetic microbial communities increased both microbial productivity and duckweed growth more than the average single-strain inoculation and uninoculated controls, meaning that host-microbiome mutualisms can emerge from community interactions among microbes on hosts. The effects of community inoculation were sub-additive, suggesting at least some competition among microbes in the duckweed microbiome. We also investigated the relationship between L. minor fitness and that of its microbes, providing some of the first empirical estimates of broad fitness alignment between plants and members of their microbiomes; hosts grew faster with more productive microbes or microbiomes.\nSmall dams drive Anopheles abundance during the dry season in a high malaria burden area of Malawi\nAuthors: Zembere, K.; Jones, C. M.; Mthawanji, R.; Nkolokosa, C.; Kamwezi, R.; Kalonde, P. K.; Stanton, M. C.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567025\nThis study explores the influence of small dams on the exposure to malaria vectors during the dry season in Kasungu district, Malawi, an area recently identified as high priority for malaria interventions by the National Malaria Control Programme. Small dam impoundments provide communities with a continuous supply of water for domestic and agricultural activities across sub-Saharan Africa and are considered vital to food security and climate change resilience. However, these permanent water bodies also create ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes in typically arid landscapes. The study focuses on a specific dam impoundment and its vicinity, aiming to assess its spatial and temporal influence on indoor vector densities. Throughout May to August 2021, CDC light traps were used to measure indoor mosquito densities for two consecutive nights per month in three communities located at increasing distances from the dam (0km, [~]1km, [~]2km). Simultaneously, drone imagery was captured for each community, enabling the identification of additional standing water within approximately 400 meters of selected households. Larval sampling was carried out within the impoundment periphery and in additional water bodies identified in the drone imagery. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were employed to analyse the indoor Anopheles abundance data, estimating the effects of household structure (open/closed eaves), month, temperature, and water proximity on malaria vector exposure. Throughout 685 trapping nights, a total of 1,256 mosquitoes were captured, with 33% (412) being female Anopheles. Among these, 91% were morphologically identified as An. funestus s.l., and 5% as An. gambiae s.l. Catches progressively declines in each consecutive trapping month as the environment became drier. This decline was much slower in Malangano, the community next to the dam, with abundance being notably higher in June and July. Further, the majority of An. gambiae s.l. were caught in May, with none identified in July and August. Anopheles larvae were found both in the impoundment and other smaller water bodies such as irrigation wells in each survey month, however the presence of these smaller water bodies did not have a significant impact on adult female mosquito catches in the GLMM. The study concludes that proximity to the dam impoundment was the primary driver of differences between survey communities with the abundance in Chikhombwe ([~]1km away) and Chiponde ([~]2km away) being 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) lower than Malangano respectively after adjusting for other factors. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions, such as larval source management or housing improvements, near small dams to mitigate malaria transmission risks during the dry season. Further research is needed to develop cost-effective strategies for vector control within and around these impoundments.\nThe evolutionary age-range size relationship is modulated by insularity and dispersal in plants and animals\nAuthors: Alzate, A.; Rozzi, R.; Velasco, J. A.; Robertson, D. R.; Zizka, A.; Tobias, J. A.; Hill, A.; Bacon, C. D.; Janzen, T.; Pellissier, L.; van der Plas, F.; Rosindell, J.; Onstein, R. E.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566377\nEarth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston \u0026 Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.\nPhotosymbiosis reduces the environmental stress response under a heat challenge in a facultatively symbiotic coral\nAuthors: Wuitchik, D. M.; Aichelman, H. E.; Atherton, K. F.; Brown, C. M.; Chen, X.; DiRoberts, L.; Pelose, G. E.; Tramonte, C. A.; Davies, S. W.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566890\nThe symbiosis between corals of the order Scleractinia and dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is sensitive to environmental stress. The oxidative bleaching hypothesis posits that extreme temperatures lead to accumulation of photobiont-derived reactive oxygen species ROS, which exacerbates the coral environmental stress response (ESR). To understand how photosymbiosis modulates coral ESRs, these responses must be explored in hosts in and out of symbiosis. We leveraged the facultatively symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata, which offers an opportunity to uncouple the ESR across its two symbiotic states (symbiotic, aposymbiotic). Colonies of both symbiotic states were exposed to three temperature treatments for 15 days: i) control (static 18{degrees}C), ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 32{degrees}C), and iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 6{degrees}C) after which host gene expression was profiled. Cold challenged corals elicited widespread differential expression, however, there were no differences between symbiotic states. In contrast, symbiotic colonies exhibited greater gene expression plasticity under heat challenge, including enrichment of cell cycle pathways involved in controlling photobiont growth. Counter to the oxidative bleaching hypothesis, this plasticity did not include signatures of stress, and rather a dampened ESR under heat challenge was observed, suggesting that photobionts reduce the hosts ESR under elevated temperatures in A. poculata.\nQuantifying potential abiotic drivers of the nurse-plant effect in two dominant shrub species of the northern Chihuahuan Desert\nAuthors: Ferrenberg, S.; Faist, A.; Osborne, B.; Lee, S.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567462\nAggregations of plants surrounded by areas without vegetation cover in dryland ecosystems are thought to arise when larger plants facilitate the recruitment and/or performance of smaller \"protege\" plants--a phenomenon referred to as the \"nurse-plant\" effect. While numerous drivers can generate a nurse-plant effect, efforts to quantify multiple drivers simultaneously are rare. After verifying a higher density of proteges beneath the foundational shrubs Larrea tridentata and Prosopis glandulosa, multiple potential mechanisms underlying the nurse-plant effect were quantified in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico. Comparisons of properties under shrub canopies relative to unvegetated interspaces revealed significantly greater concentrations of soil nutrients and lower photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperatures beneath shrubs but a consistently higher soil moisture in interspaces despite a greater water holding capacity in soils beneath shrubs. Nutrient concentrations were greater, on average, in soils beneath P. glandulosa than L. tridentata but protege plant numbers did not significantly differ among the species. Further, in L. tridentata and P. glandulosa, canopy size was positively related to levels of understory shading, and canopy size of P. glandulosa was also positively related to soil nitrogen and microbial biomass. Results of this study suggest that a majority of the variance in the abiotic nurse-plant effect of this low-latitude system is explained by radiation interception and the concomitant reduction in temperatures experienced by protege plants as opposed to direct effects of shrubs on soil water availability. As global change pressures intensify in drylands, a loss of perennial plant cover through mortality or dieback in canopies could have substantial, negative effects on soil biogeochemical pools and plant diversity. Additional quantification of the spatial and temporal variance in different mechanisms driving the nurse-plant effect across environmental and climatic gradients is needed to improve our understanding of plant community dynamics in dryland ecosystems.\nEvaluating diversionary feeding as a method to resolve conservation conflicts in a recovering ecosystem\nAuthors: Bamber, J.; Kortland, K.; Sutherland, C.; Payo-Payo, A.; Lambin, X.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566200\nO_LIThe recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery. C_LIO_LIWe evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped. C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year. C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay. C_LI\nThe challenges of independence: ontogeny of at-sea behaviour in a long-lived seabird\nAuthors: Delord, K.; Weimerskirch, H.; Barbraud, C.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2021.10.23.465439\nThe transition to independent foraging represents an important developmental stage in the life cycle of most vertebrate animals. Juveniles differ from adults in various life history traits and tend to survive less well than adults in most long-lived animals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain higher mortality including that of inadequate/inferior foraging skills compared to adults, young naive individuals combining lack of experience and physical immaturity. Thus a change in behaviour, resulting in an improvement of skills acquired from growing experience, is expected to occur during a period of learning through the immaturity phase. Very few studies have investigated the ontogeny of foraging behaviour over long periods of time, particularly in long-lived pelagic seabirds, due to the difficulty of obtaining individual tracking data over several years. We investigated the foraging behaviour, through activity patterns, during the three life stages of the endangered Amsterdam albatross by using miniaturized activity loggers on naive juveniles, immatures and adults. Naive juveniles during their first month at sea after leaving their colony exhibited lower foraging effort (greater proportion of time spent sitting on water, longer and more numerous bouts on water, shorter and fewer flying bouts). Patterns of activity parameters in juveniles after independence suggested a progressive change of foraging performances during the first two months after fledging. We found sex differences in activity parameters according to time since departure from the colony and month of the year, consistent with the important sexual dimorphism in the Amsterdam albatross. Regardless of life stage considered, activity parameters exhibited temporal variability reflecting the modulation of foraging behaviour. This variability is discussed in light of both extrinsic (i.e. environmental conditions such as variability in food resources or in wind) and intrinsic (i.e. energetic demands linked to plumage renew during moult) factors.\nFlower visitor groups show differential responses to individual and plot-level chemodiversity with consequences for plant fitness\nAuthors: Sasidharan, R.; Grond, S. G.; Champion, S.; Eilers, E. J.; Mueller, C.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568056\n1. Chemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood. 2. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined. 3. Our findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type. 4. Synthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.\n",

        <p class="abstract">O_LISpecies from a great number of animal taxa have specialized to living with social hosts. Depending on their level of specialization, these symbiotic animals are characterized by distinct behavioural, chemical, and morphological traits that enable close heterospecific interactions. Despite its functional importance, our understanding of the feeding ecology of specialized animals living with social hosts remains limited.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we examined how host specialization of silverfish co-habiting with ants affects several components of their feeding ecology. We combined stable isotope profiling, feeding assays, phylogenetic reconstruction, and microbial community characterization of the Neoasterolepisma silverfish genus and a wider nicoletiid and lepismatid silverfish panel where divergent myrmecophilous lifestyles are observed.
C_LIO_LIStable isotope profiling ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) showed that the isotopic niches (proxy for trophic niches) of granivorous Messor ants and Messor-specialized Neoasterolepisma exhibit a remarkable overlap within an ant nest. Trophic experiments and gut dissections further supported that these specialized Neoasterolepisma silverfish transitioned to a diet that includes plant seeds. In contrast, the isotopic niches of generalist Neoasterolepisma silverfish and generalist nicoletiid silverfish were clearly different from their ant hosts within the shared nest environment.
C_LIO_LIThe impact of the myrmecophilous lifestyle on feeding ecology was also evident in the internal silverfish microbiome. Compared to generalists, Messor-specialists exhibited a higher bacterial density and a higher proportion of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Moreover, the nest environment explained the infection profile (or the 16S rRNA genotypes) of Weissella bacteria in Messor-specialized silverfish and the ant hosts.
C_LIO_LITogether, we show that social hosts are important determinants for the feeding ecology of symbiotic animals, and can induce diet convergence.

        <p class="abstract">Ocean acidification (OA) has numerous impacts on marine organisms including behaviour. While behaviours are controlled in the neuro system, its complexity makes linking behavioural impairments to environmental change difficult. Here we use a neurological model Aplysia californica with well-studied simple neuro system and behaviours. By exposing Aplysia to current day ([~]500 {micro}atm) or near-future CO2 conditions ([~]1100 {micro}atm), we test the effect of OA on their tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) and the underlying neuromolecular response of the pleural-pedal ganglia, responsible for the behaviour. Under OA, Aplysia relax tails faster due to increased sensorin-A expression, an inhibitor of mechanosensory neurons. We further investigate how OA affects habituation, which produced a &#34;sensitization-like&#34; behaviour and affected vesicle transport and stress response, revealing an influence of OA on neuronal and behavioural outputs associated with learning. Finally, we test whether GABA-mediated neurotransmission is involved in impaired TWR, but exposure to gabazine did not restore normal behaviour and provoked little molecular response, rejecting the involvement in TWR impairment. Instead, vesicular transport and cellular signalling link other neurotransmitter processes directly with TWR impairment. Our study shows effects of OA on neurological tissue parts that control for behaviour revealing the neurological mechanisms when faced with OA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbiomes often benefit plants, conferring resistance to pathogens, improving stress tolerance, or promoting plant growth. As potential plant mutualists, however, microbiomes are not a single organism but a community of species with complex interactions among microbial taxa and between microbes and their shared host. The nature of ecological interactions among microbes in the microbiome can have important consequences for the net effects of microbiomes on hosts. Here, we compared the effects of individual microbial strains and 10-strain synthetic communities on microbial productivity and host growth using the common duckweed Lemna minor and a synthetic, simplified version of its native microbiome. Except for Pseudomonas protegens, which was a mutualist when tested alone, all of the single strains we tested were commensals on hosts, benefiting from plant presence but not increasing host growth relative to uninoculated controls. However, 10-strain synthetic microbial communities increased both microbial productivity and duckweed growth more than the average single-strain inoculation and uninoculated controls, meaning that host-microbiome mutualisms can emerge from community interactions among microbes on hosts. The effects of community inoculation were sub-additive, suggesting at least some competition among microbes in the duckweed microbiome. We also investigated the relationship between L. minor fitness and that of its microbes, providing some of the first empirical estimates of broad fitness alignment between plants and members of their microbiomes; hosts grew faster with more productive microbes or microbiomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study explores the influence of small dams on the exposure to malaria vectors during the dry season in Kasungu district, Malawi, an area recently identified as high priority for malaria interventions by the National Malaria Control Programme. Small dam impoundments provide communities with a continuous supply of water for domestic and agricultural activities across sub-Saharan Africa and are considered vital to food security and climate change resilience. However, these permanent water bodies also create ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes in typically arid landscapes. The study focuses on a specific dam impoundment and its vicinity, aiming to assess its spatial and temporal influence on indoor vector densities.

Throughout May to August 2021, CDC light traps were used to measure indoor mosquito densities for two consecutive nights per month in three communities located at increasing distances from the dam (0km, [~]1km, [~]2km). Simultaneously, drone imagery was captured for each community, enabling the identification of additional standing water within approximately 400 meters of selected households. Larval sampling was carried out within the impoundment periphery and in additional water bodies identified in the drone imagery. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were employed to analyse the indoor Anopheles abundance data, estimating the effects of household structure (open/closed eaves), month, temperature, and water proximity on malaria vector exposure.

Throughout 685 trapping nights, a total of 1,256 mosquitoes were captured, with 33% (412) being female Anopheles. Among these, 91% were morphologically identified as An. funestus s.l., and 5% as An. gambiae s.l. Catches progressively declines in each consecutive trapping month as the environment became drier. This decline was much slower in Malangano, the community next to the dam, with abundance being notably higher in June and July. Further, the majority of An. gambiae s.l. were caught in May, with none identified in July and August. Anopheles larvae were found both in the impoundment and other smaller water bodies such as irrigation wells in each survey month, however the presence of these smaller water bodies did not have a significant impact on adult female mosquito catches in the GLMM. The study concludes that proximity to the dam impoundment was the primary driver of differences between survey communities with the abundance in Chikhombwe ([~]1km away) and Chiponde ([~]2km away) being 0.35 (95% CI 0.19-0.66) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) lower than Malangano respectively after adjusting for other factors.

These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions, such as larval source management or housing improvements, near small dams to mitigate malaria transmission risks during the dry season. Further research is needed to develop cost-effective strategies for vector control within and around these impoundments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Earth is home to millions of plant and animal species, with more than 40 thousand species facing extinction worldwide (Diaz et al. 2019). Species range size is particularly important in this context because it influences extinction risk (Purvis et al. 2000, Gaston &amp; Fuller 2009), but the causes underlying the wide natural variation in range size remain poorly known. Here, we investigate how evolutionary age is related to present-day range size for over 25,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, reef fishes, and plants. We show that, on average, older species have significantly larger ranges, but the effect of age on range size is modulated by clade, geographical context and dispersal ability. Specifically, age does not affect range size for island species, because islands limit dispersal and hence range size, regardless of species age. Furthermore, species from clades with high dispersal capabilities obtain large ranges faster, thereby further neutralizing the relationship between age and range size. Our results can help supporting global conservation priorities, by showing that species that are young, occupy islands, and/or are dispersal limited often have small ranges and therefore increased extinction risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The symbiosis between corals of the order Scleractinia and dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is sensitive to environmental stress. The oxidative bleaching hypothesis posits that extreme temperatures lead to accumulation of photobiont-derived reactive oxygen species ROS, which exacerbates the coral environmental stress response (ESR). To understand how photosymbiosis modulates coral ESRs, these responses must be explored in hosts in and out of symbiosis. We leveraged the facultatively symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata, which offers an opportunity to uncouple the ESR across its two symbiotic states (symbiotic, aposymbiotic). Colonies of both symbiotic states were exposed to three temperature treatments for 15 days: i) control (static 18{degrees}C), ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 32{degrees}C), and iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 6{degrees}C) after which host gene expression was profiled. Cold challenged corals elicited widespread differential expression, however, there were no differences between symbiotic states. In contrast, symbiotic colonies exhibited greater gene expression plasticity under heat challenge, including enrichment of cell cycle pathways involved in controlling photobiont growth. Counter to the oxidative bleaching hypothesis, this plasticity did not include signatures of stress, and rather a dampened ESR under heat challenge was observed, suggesting that photobionts reduce the hosts ESR under elevated temperatures in A. poculata.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aggregations of plants surrounded by areas without vegetation cover in dryland ecosystems are thought to arise when larger plants facilitate the recruitment and/or performance of smaller &#34;protege&#34; plants--a phenomenon referred to as the &#34;nurse-plant&#34; effect. While numerous drivers can generate a nurse-plant effect, efforts to quantify multiple drivers simultaneously are rare. After verifying a higher density of proteges beneath the foundational shrubs Larrea tridentata and Prosopis glandulosa, multiple potential mechanisms underlying the nurse-plant effect were quantified in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico. Comparisons of properties under shrub canopies relative to unvegetated interspaces revealed significantly greater concentrations of soil nutrients and lower photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperatures beneath shrubs but a consistently higher soil moisture in interspaces despite a greater water holding capacity in soils beneath shrubs. Nutrient concentrations were greater, on average, in soils beneath P. glandulosa than L. tridentata but protege plant numbers did not significantly differ among the species. Further, in L. tridentata and P. glandulosa, canopy size was positively related to levels of understory shading, and canopy size of P. glandulosa was also positively related to soil nitrogen and microbial biomass. Results of this study suggest that a majority of the variance in the abiotic nurse-plant effect of this low-latitude system is explained by radiation interception and the concomitant reduction in temperatures experienced by protege plants as opposed to direct effects of shrubs on soil water availability. As global change pressures intensify in drylands, a loss of perennial plant cover through mortality or dieback in canopies could have substantial, negative effects on soil biogeochemical pools and plant diversity. Additional quantification of the spatial and temporal variance in different mechanisms driving the nurse-plant effect across environmental and climatic gradients is needed to improve our understanding of plant community dynamics in dryland ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIThe recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.
C_LIO_LIWe evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, each with six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was conducted over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were swapped.
C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.
C_LIO_LIDiversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.

        <p class="abstract">The transition to independent foraging represents an important developmental stage in the life cycle of most vertebrate animals. Juveniles differ from adults in various life history traits and tend to survive less well than adults in most long-lived animals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain higher mortality including that of inadequate/inferior foraging skills compared to adults, young naive individuals combining lack of experience and physical immaturity. Thus a change in behaviour, resulting in an improvement of skills acquired from growing experience, is expected to occur during a period of learning through the immaturity phase. Very few studies have investigated the ontogeny of foraging behaviour over long periods of time, particularly in long-lived pelagic seabirds, due to the difficulty of obtaining individual tracking data over several years. We investigated the foraging behaviour, through activity patterns, during the three life stages of the endangered Amsterdam albatross by using miniaturized activity loggers on naive juveniles, immatures and adults. Naive juveniles during their first month at sea after leaving their colony exhibited lower foraging effort (greater proportion of time spent sitting on water, longer and more numerous bouts on water, shorter and fewer flying bouts). Patterns of activity parameters in juveniles after independence suggested a progressive change of foraging performances during the first two months after fledging. We found sex differences in activity parameters according to time since departure from the colony and month of the year, consistent with the important sexual dimorphism in the Amsterdam albatross. Regardless of life stage considered, activity parameters exhibited temporal variability reflecting the modulation of foraging behaviour. This variability is discussed in light of both extrinsic (i.e. environmental conditions such as variability in food resources or in wind) and intrinsic (i.e. energetic demands linked to plumage renew during moult) factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1. Chemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood. 2. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined. 3. Our findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type. 4. Synthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.</p>
