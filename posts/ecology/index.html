M.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558467\nThere is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.

A.; Nandini, R.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557893\nComplex colour pattern traits often evolve in response to multiple selective pressures, emphasizing the need for their investigation in an integrative framework. We use museum specimens (n=718) to study the evolution of coat colouration in three palm squirrel species (Funambulus spp.) in the Indian subcontinent, with climate, vegetation, and predators as the potential selective forces. Our results indicate a strong geographical trend in coat colour distribution within and across species, with darker individuals in the southern and lighter individuals in the northern regions. We find significant darkening of coat colouration in more humid, densely vegetated regions with dark soils. Fine-scale intra-specific analyses suggest that species respond differently to multiple abiotic selective pressures. Investigation of stripe pattern elements suggests that the colour-based elements are more visible to raptors, while luminance-based elements are more visible to ferrets. We also find that squirrel species are darker in areas with denser and taller canopies, with low-contrast stripes specific to each predators vision. Overall, squirrel coat colouration evolves in response to multiple abiotic factors, including climate and habitat, and specific stripe elements provide particular visual effects on predators depending on the habitat.\nThe Atlantic Forest of South America: spatiotemporal dynamics of remaining vegetation and implications for conservation\nAuthors: Vancine, M. H.; Muylaert, R. L.; Niebuhr, B. B.; Oshima, J. E. d. F.; Tonetti, V.; Bernardo, R.; De Angelo, C.; Rosa, M. R.; Grohmann, C. H.; Ribeiro, M. C.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.558076\nThe Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (\u003e500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (\u003c50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is \u003c90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250- 830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (\u003e10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future. HighlightsO_LIThere is 23% forest and 40% natural vegetation cover remaining in the Atlantic Forest. C_LIO_LIBetween 1986-2020, native forest cover decreased by 2.4% and natural vegetation by 3.6%.

C.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559203\nFive years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.\nPatterns and drivers of pollen co-transport networks vary across pollinator groups\nAuthors: Carneiro, L. T.; Williams, J. N.; Barker, D. A.; Anderson, J. W.; Martel, C.; Arceo-Gomez, G.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558666\nPollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.\nLarval thermosensitivity shapes adult population dynamics in Anopheles mosquitoes\nAuthors: Estupinan, J.; Weyrich, A. M.; Schloesser, P.; Naujoks, C.; Gildenhard, M.; Diarra, A.; Diallo, M.; Sangare, D.; Telschow, A.; Hsieh, C.-h.; Levashina, E. A.; Carrillo-Bustamante, P.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558414\nMosquitoes are vectors of human life-threatening pathogens, posing a significant global health threat. While the influence of temperature on mosquito life-history traits has been extensively studied in laboratory settings, the ecological factors shaping mosquito development and population dynamics in natural environments remain poorly understood. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating field data from Mali, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling, to investigate the causal relationships between climate variables and the abundance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Using convergent-cross mapping analyses an adult abundance in the Nanguilabou village, we observed that the dynamics of adult mosquito populations was driven by larval thermosensitivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experimental studies that revealed a density-dependent larval thermal response. Through mathematical modeling, we quantified the complex interplay between temperature and larval density, demonstrating that temperature and density have independent, non-synergistic effects on larval developmental speed, mortality, and pupation rates. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how larval development shapes adult mosquito populations, highlighting the significance of multidisciplinary approaches in studying climate-driven mosquito population dynamics.\nMetagenomic analysis of individual mosquitos reveals the ecology of insect viruses\nAuthors: Pan, Y.-f.; Zhao, H.; Gou, Q.-y.; Shi, P.-b.; Tian, J.-h.; Feng, Y.; Li, K.; Yang, W.-h.; Wu, D.; Tang, G.; Zhang, B.; Ren, Z.; Peng, S.; Luo, G.-y.; Le, S.-j.; Xin, G.-y.; Wang, J.; Hou, X.; Peng, M.-w.; Kong, J.-b.; Chen, X.-x.; Yang, C.-h.; Mei, S.-q.; Liao, Y.-q.; Cheng, J.-x.; Wang, J.; Chaolemen, ; Wu, Y.-h.; Wang, J.-b.; An, T.; Huang, X.; Eden, J.-S.; Li, J.; Guo, D.; Liang, G.; Jin, X.; Holmes, E. C.; Li, B.; Wang, D.; Li, J.; Wu, W.-c.; Shi, M.\nScore: 79.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555221\nMosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.\nPhylogenetic diversity and regionalization of root nodule symbiosis\nAuthors: Folk, R. A.; Belitz, M.; Siniscalchi, C.; Kates, H. R.; Soltis, D. E.; Soltis, P. S.; Guralnick, R. P.; Borges, L. M.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556918\nAimHere we determine centers of species richness (SR), relative phylogenetic diversity (RPD) and centers of paleo- and neo-endemism, and regionalizations of phylogenetic diversity in the mimosoid clade of the legumes to understand the distribution and environmental associates of mimosoids lacking RNS (root nodule symbiosis). LocationGlobal. Time periodPresent. Major taxa studiedMimosoid legumes. MethodsWe built a phylogenetic tree of 1313 species and high-quality species distribution models for 1128 species representing the phylogenetic breadth of the mimosoid clade to identify the geographic distribution of RNS. Centers of significant RPD and endemism were identified using a randomization approach, the latter using CANAPE. Phylogenetic regionalization used a distance-based phylogenetic beta-diversity approach. ResultsWe recognized nine areas of contiguous high SR as distinct SR hotspots. Non-RNS species occur mainly outside hotspots but are closely correlated with high RPD. Absence of RNS was best predicted by high precipitation, and represents multiple independent phylogenetic assemblages in different biogeographic areas. Main conclusionsSR hotspots are partly incongruent with centers of RPD and phylogenetic endemism. Lineages lacking RNS are distributed in SR hotspots in Africa and the Americas, belong to biogeographically separate species assemblages, and are, in most cases, associated with relatively moist tropical environments with low temperature seasonality and high available soil nitrogen.\nHost-pathogen-vector continuum in a changing landscape: Drivers of Bartonella prevalence and evidence of historic spillover in a tropical multi-host community\nAuthors: Ansil, B. R.; Viswanathan, A.; Ramachandran, V.; Yeshwanth, H. M.; Sanyal, A.; Ramakrishnan, U.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559241\nOur understanding of pathogen spillover is largely based on viral systems associated with bats. Bacterial infections of zoonotic origin also pose a significant public health burden, many of which are associated with small mammals like rodents that live abundantly among humans. When ecologically different species of small mammals are brought in contact with each other due to various factors, including habitat modification, there is potential for bacterial spillover within the host community and subsequently to humans. Small mammals and their ectoparasite communities present a unique system to investigate the eco-epidemiology of multi-host pathogens, which can inform specific bacterial spillover determinants and their interplay. In a rainforest-human-use mosaic, we applied ecological and evolutionary analysis to investigate Bartonella spp. across small mammal and ectoparasite communities. We observed substantial overlap among small mammal communities in different habitat types, predominantly driven by habitat generalists. Most ectoparasites were generalists, infecting multiple hosts, and several host species displayed polyparasitism, i.e., they were infected by multiple ectoparasites. We observed high Bartonella prevalence at both study sites -- a forest-plantation mosaic (47.4%) and a protected area (28.8%). Seven of the ten ectoparasite morphotypes sampled were also positive for Bartonella, following the prevalence trend in their hosts. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) revealed an independent association between aggregated ectoparasite load in species and Bartonella prevalence, implicating ectoparasites in transmission. Bartonella lineages from small mammals were host-specific, while ectoparasites showed no host-specific associations. They carried Bartonella associated with other hosts, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral trait reconstruction of Bartonella haplotypes suggests historic spillover events in the small mammal community, validating the potential for contemporary spillover. These results highlight infection risk from such underdiagnosed agents in the landscape, and the necessity to disentangle complex multi-host multi-vector systems to understand their epidemiological consequences.\nThe demographic history of the wild crop relative Brachypodium distachyon is shaped by distinct past and present ecological niches.\nAuthors: Minadakis, N.; Williams, H.; Horvath, R.; Cakovic, D.; Stritt, C.; Thieme, M.; Bourgeois, Y. X. C.; Roulin, A.\nScore: 26.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543285\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClosely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a fifth of the worlds dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.\n",

        <p class="abstract">There is considerable interest in understanding patterns of {beta}-diversity that measure the amount of change in species composition through space or time. Most hypotheses for {beta}-diversity evoke nonrandom processes that generate spatial and temporal within species aggregation; however, {beta}-diversity can also be driven by random sampling processes. Here, we describe a framework based on rarefaction curves that quantifies the non-random contribution of species compositional differences across samples to {beta}-diversity. We isolate the effect of within-species spatial or temporal aggregation on beta-diversity using a coverage standardized metric of {beta}-diversity ({beta}C). We demonstrate the utility of our framework using simulations and an empirical case study examining variation in avian species composition through space and time in engineered versus natural riparian areas. The primary strengths of our approach are that it provides an intuitive visual null model for expected patterns of biodiversity under random sampling that allows integrating analyses across -, {gamma}-, and {beta}-scales. Importantly, the method can accommodate comparisons between communities with different species pool sizes, and can be used to examine species turnover both within and between meta-communities.

        <p class="abstract">Complex colour pattern traits often evolve in response to multiple selective pressures, emphasizing the need for their investigation in an integrative framework. We use museum specimens (n=718) to study the evolution of coat colouration in three palm squirrel species (Funambulus spp.) in the Indian subcontinent, with climate, vegetation, and predators as the potential selective forces. Our results indicate a strong geographical trend in coat colour distribution within and across species, with darker individuals in the southern and lighter individuals in the northern regions. We find significant darkening of coat colouration in more humid, densely vegetated regions with dark soils. Fine-scale intra-specific analyses suggest that species respond differently to multiple abiotic selective pressures. Investigation of stripe pattern elements suggests that the colour-based elements are more visible to raptors, while luminance-based elements are more visible to ferrets. We also find that squirrel species are darker in areas with denser and taller canopies, with low-contrast stripes specific to each predators vision. Overall, squirrel coat colouration evolves in response to multiple abiotic factors, including climate and habitat, and specific stripe elements provide particular visual effects on predators depending on the habitat.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Atlantic Forest in South America (AF) is one of the worlds most diverse and threatened biodiversity hotspots. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986-2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and investigated the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, remnants comprise about 23% of FV and 40% of NV, and have decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure negatively affected large fragments (&gt;500,000 ha) by breaking them apart. Our findings suggest that AF protection legislation adopted in mid-2005 has taken effect: between 1986-2005, there was a loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.45%) and a decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.3%). Between 2005-2020, there was a relative recovery of FV (1 Mha; 0.6%), slight loss of NV (0.25 Mha; 0.15%) and increase in the number of FV and NV fragments (12% and 9%). Still, 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (&lt;50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16 and 26 ha. Furthermore, 50-60% of the vegetation is &lt;90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250- 830 m). Alarmingly, protected areas and indigenous territories cover only 10% of the AF and are very far from any fragments (&gt;10 km). Our work highlights the importance of legislation and landscape dynamics analysis to help monitor and keep track of AF biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in the future.

        <p class="abstract">Five years after the well-known study on insect biomass decline in nature protected habitats in Germany over three decades, the project DINA (Diversity of Insects in Nature protected Areas) has investigated the status of insects in 21 selected nature reserves across Germany in the years 2020 and 2021. We used the same methods and protocols for trapping and measuring the biomass of flying insects as in the mentioned study. Across two seasons, we accumulated a comprehensive data set of 1621 data points of two-week emptying intervals. The measured overall insect biomass remained at low levels and corresponds to the published latest figures from the years 2007-2016. There were no significant regional differences, but biomass was negatively correlated with agricultural production area within 2 km of nature reserves. Differences between the two consecutive years were very likely due to well-known natural fluctuations of insect populations, changes in agricultural cultivation and local weather events. The results show that protected habitats are essential for insects, but not sufficient in their function, and that further steps need to be taken for a better protection and sustainment of insects, which fulfil key functions in many ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pollen transport is an understudied process with consequences for plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recently, pollinator bodies have been described as pollen competition arenas, with implications for plant community assembly. However, the identity, strength, and diversity of pollen competitive interactions and how they vary across pollinator groups is unknown. Evaluating patterns and drivers of the pollen competition landscape across different pollinator groups is central to further our understanding of plant coexistence mechanisms. Here, we integrate information on insect pollen loads with network analyses to uncover novel pollen co-transport networks and how these vary across pollinators. We evaluate differences in pollen load size, diversity and their phenological and phylogenetic attributes among insect groups and how these relate to body size and sex. Pollen co-transport networks revealed differences in the number and identity of competitors that pollen species encounter across pollinator groups. These networks were highly modular, with groups of pollen species interacting more often on pollinator bodies. Pollen load size and richness were shaped by bee size and sex. Sex also influenced the pollen phylogenetical diversity. Pollinators can impose vastly different competitive landscapes during pollen transport, with so far unknown consequences for plant reproductive success, floral evolution and community assembly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes are vectors of human life-threatening pathogens, posing a significant global health threat. While the influence of temperature on mosquito life-history traits has been extensively studied in laboratory settings, the ecological factors shaping mosquito development and population dynamics in natural environments remain poorly understood. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating field data from Mali, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling, to investigate the causal relationships between climate variables and the abundance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Using convergent-cross mapping analyses an adult abundance in the Nanguilabou village, we observed that the dynamics of adult mosquito populations was driven by larval thermosensitivity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experimental studies that revealed a density-dependent larval thermal response. Through mathematical modeling, we quantified the complex interplay between temperature and larval density, demonstrating that temperature and density have independent, non-synergistic effects on larval developmental speed, mortality, and pupation rates. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how larval development shapes adult mosquito populations, highlighting the significance of multidisciplinary approaches in studying climate-driven mosquito population dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimHere we determine centers of species richness (SR), relative phylogenetic diversity (RPD) and centers of paleo- and neo-endemism, and regionalizations of phylogenetic diversity in the mimosoid clade of the legumes to understand the distribution and environmental associates of mimosoids lacking RNS (root nodule symbiosis).

LocationGlobal.

Time periodPresent.

Major taxa studiedMimosoid legumes.

MethodsWe built a phylogenetic tree of 1313 species and high-quality species distribution models for 1128 species representing the phylogenetic breadth of the mimosoid clade to identify the geographic distribution of RNS. Centers of significant RPD and endemism were identified using a randomization approach, the latter using CANAPE. Phylogenetic regionalization used a distance-based phylogenetic beta-diversity approach.

ResultsWe recognized nine areas of contiguous high SR as distinct SR hotspots. Non-RNS species occur mainly outside hotspots but are closely correlated with high RPD. Absence of RNS was best predicted by high precipitation, and represents multiple independent phylogenetic assemblages in different biogeographic areas.

Main conclusionsSR hotspots are partly incongruent with centers of RPD and phylogenetic endemism. Lineages lacking RNS are distributed in SR hotspots in Africa and the Americas, belong to biogeographically separate species assemblages, and are, in most cases, associated with relatively moist tropical environments with low temperature seasonality and high available soil nitrogen.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our understanding of pathogen spillover is largely based on viral systems associated with bats. Bacterial infections of zoonotic origin also pose a significant public health burden, many of which are associated with small mammals like rodents that live abundantly among humans. When ecologically different species of small mammals are brought in contact with each other due to various factors, including habitat modification, there is potential for bacterial spillover within the host community and subsequently to humans. Small mammals and their ectoparasite communities present a unique system to investigate the eco-epidemiology of multi-host pathogens, which can inform specific bacterial spillover determinants and their interplay. In a rainforest-human-use mosaic, we applied ecological and evolutionary analysis to investigate Bartonella spp. across small mammal and ectoparasite communities. We observed substantial overlap among small mammal communities in different habitat types, predominantly driven by habitat generalists. Most ectoparasites were generalists, infecting multiple hosts, and several host species displayed polyparasitism, i.e., they were infected by multiple ectoparasites. We observed high Bartonella prevalence at both study sites -- a forest-plantation mosaic (47.4%) and a protected area (28.8%). Seven of the ten ectoparasite morphotypes sampled were also positive for Bartonella, following the prevalence trend in their hosts. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) revealed an independent association between aggregated ectoparasite load in species and Bartonella prevalence, implicating ectoparasites in transmission. Bartonella lineages from small mammals were host-specific, while ectoparasites showed no host-specific associations. They carried Bartonella associated with other hosts, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral trait reconstruction of Bartonella haplotypes suggests historic spillover events in the small mammal community, validating the potential for contemporary spillover. These results highlight infection risk from such underdiagnosed agents in the landscape, and the necessity to disentangle complex multi-host multi-vector systems to understand their epidemiological consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClosely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a fifth of the worlds dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.</p>
