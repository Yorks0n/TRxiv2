Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum.">

However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation \u003c30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.\nSounds of the underground reflect soil biodiversity dynamics across a grassy woodland restoration chronosequence\nAuthors: Robinson, J. M.; Taylor, A.; Fickling, N.; Sun, X.; Breed, M. F.\nScore: 54.8, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577311\nFifty-nine percent of the worlds species inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our planets most diverse ecosystems.\nCommunity context influences the conjugation efficiency of E. coli\nAuthors: Bustamante, M.; Koopman, F.; Martens, J.; Brons, J. K.; DelaFuente, J.; Kuipers, O.; van Doorn, G. S.; de Vos, M.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577951\nIn urinary tract infections different bacteria can live in a polymicrobial community, it is unknown how such community members affect the conjugation rate of uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We investigated the influence of the polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI) community context on the conjugation rate of E. coli isolates in artificial urine medium. Pairwise conjugation rate experiments were conducted between a donor E. coli strain containing pOXA-48 and six uropathogenic E. coli isolates in the presence and absence of five community members to elucidate their effect on the rate of conjugation. We found that the basal conjugation rates in the absence of community members are genotype dependent. Interestingly, bacterial interactions have an overall positive effect on E. coli conjugation rates. Particularly Gram-positive enterococcal species were found to enhance the conjugation rates of most uropathogenic E. coli isolates. We hypothesize that the nature and co-culture of the interactions is important for these increased conjugation rates in AUM.\nBetween a Warm Winter and a Cold Spell: Physiological Responses to Changing Winter Climate in Amphibians\nAuthors: Schmidt, R.; Zummach, C.; Sinai, N.; Sabino-Pinto, J.; Kuenzel, S.; Dausmann, K. H.; Ruthsatz, K.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574103\nClimate change is swiftly altering environmental winter conditions, leading to significant ecological impacts such as phenological shifts in many species. As a result, animals might face physiological mismatches due to longer or earlier activity periods and are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. Our study points for the first time to the complex physiological challenges that amphibians face as a result of changing thermal conditions due to winter climate change. We investigated the physiological responses to a period of warmer winter days and sudden spring freeze in the common toad (Bufo bufo) by acclimating them to 4{degrees}C or 8{degrees}C for 48 h or exposing them to 4{degrees}C or -2{degrees}C for 6 h, respectively. We assessed the daily energy demands, determined body condition and cold tolerance, explored the molecular responses to freezing through hepatic tissue transcriptome analysis, and measured blood glucose levels. Toads acclimated to higher temperatures showed a higher daily energy expenditure and a reduced cold tolerance suggesting faster depletion of energy stores and the loss of winter acclimation during warmer winters. Blood sugar levels were higher in frozen toads indicating the mobilization of cryoprotective glucose with freezing which was further supported by changed patterns in proteins related to glucose metabolism. Overall, our results emphasize that increased thermal variability incurs physiological costs that may reduce energy reserves and thus affect amphibian health and survival. This might pose a serious threat to breeding adults and may have subsequent effects at the population level.\nComparative analysis of the plasma metabolome of migrating passerines during stopover: Novel insights into flight metabolism\nAuthors: Domer, A.; Jasinska, W.; Rosental, L.; Shochat, E.; Fernie, A. R.; Alseekh, S.; Brotman, Y.; Ovadia, O.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574878\nDuring long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.\nMitochondrial DNA analysis in ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) raises an urgent conservation need for its southernmost population\nAuthors: Ha, L. M.; Tran, H. D.; Takeshima, H.; Iguchi, K.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577666\nThe central-marginal hypothesis predicts that genetic diversity decreases and genetic differentiation increases toward the species distribution margin. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) collected from different localities, including central and marginal populations, to test the hypothesis. The results show that the ayu populations at southern marginal habitats (Tien Yen River in Vietnam and Yakugachi River in Amami-oshima Island) displayed low genetic diversity (Haplotype diversity, H = 0.52 and 0.67; Nucleotide diversity, Pi = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively) and significantly differed from the central populations (p \u003c 0.001), consistent with the central-marginal hypothesis. However, ayu populations at the center of their distribution range (Shinano River in Honsyu and Hamoji River in Sado Island) and the northern marginal habitats (Yoichi River in Hokkaido and Aonae River in Okushiri Island) exhibited high genetic diversity (H = 1 for all rivers; Pi = 0.024-0.029). The genetic differences between the populations at the center and the northern marginal habitats were insignificant (p \u003e 0.05). This study showed that in ayu, the central-marginal hypothesis is valid in the southern direction but not in the northern direction. Urgent conservation is needed for the genetically distinct population in the degraded southern habitat with severely low genetic diversity.\nPhysiological and behavioural resistance of malaria vectors in rural West-Africa : a data mining study to address their fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity, drivers, and predictability\nAuthors: Taconet, P.; SOMA, D. D.; Zogo, B.; Mouline, K.; Simard, F.; Koffi, A. A.; Dabire, R. K.; Pennetier, C.; Moiroux, N.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.20.504631\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.\nAssessing the dynamics of Mycobacterium bovis infection in three French badger populations\nAuthors: Calenge, C.; Payne, A.; Reveillaud, E.; Richomme, C.; Girard, S.; Desvaux, S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.543041\nThe Sylvatub system is a national surveillance program established in 2011 in France to monitor infections caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the main etiologic agent of bovine tuberculosis, in wild species. This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.\nBacterial communities of Cassiopea in the Florida Keys share major bacterial taxa with coral microbiomes\nAuthors: Muffett, K. M.; Miglietta, M. P.; Labonte, J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577655\nInteractions with microbial communities fundamentally shape metazoans physiology, development, and health across marine ecosystems. This is especially true in zooxanthellate (symbiotic algae-containing) cnidarians. In photosymbiotic anthozoans (eg. shallow water anemones and corals), the key members of the associated microbiota are increasingly well studied, but there is limited data on photosymbiotic scyphozoans (true jellyfish). Using 16S rRNA barcoding, we sampled the internal and external mucus of the zooxanthellate Upside- Down Jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana and C. andromeda, throughout eight sites covering the full length of the Florida Keys. We find these medusae to have low-diversity internal microbial communities distinct from the communities of their external surfaces and their environment. These internal communities are dominated by only three taxa: Endozoicomonadaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, and Vibrionaceae. External mucosal samples conform largely to the communities of surrounding sediment with the addition of Endozoicomonadaceae. The microbial taxa we identify associated with wild Florida Keys Cassiopea bear a strong resemblance to those found within photosymbiotic anthozoans, increasing the known links in ecological position between these groups.\nSelfish herd effects in aggregated caterpillars and their interaction with warning signals\nAuthors: Kersh-Mellor, R.; Montgomery, S. H.; McLellan, C. F.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578162\nLarval Lepidoptera gain survival advantages by aggregating, especially when combined with aposematic warning signals, yet reductions in predation risk may not be experienced equally across all group members. Hamiltons selfish herd theory predicts that larvae which surround themselves with their group mates should be at lower risk of predation, and those on the periphery of aggregations experience the greatest risk, yet this has rarely been tested. Here, we expose aggregations of artificial caterpillar targets to predation from free-flying, wild birds to test for marginal predation when all prey are equally accessible, and for an interaction between warning colouration and marginal predation. We find that targets nearer the centre of the aggregation survived better than peripheral targets and nearby targets isolated from the group. However, there was no difference in survival between peripheral and isolated targets. We also find that grouped targets survived better than isolated targets when both are aposematic, but not when they are non-signalling. Our data suggest that avian predators preferentially target peripheral larvae from aggregations, and that prey warning signals enhance predator avoidance of groups.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ecosystem restoration interventions often utilise visible elements to restore an ecosystem (e.g., replanting native plant communities and reintroducing lost species). However, using acoustic stimulation to restore ecosystems has received little attention. Our study aimed to (a) investigate the potential effects of acoustic stimulation on fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition, which are both crucial components of ecosystem functioning and (b) assess the effect of acoustic stimulation on the growth rate and sporulation of the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum. We played 70 dB and 90 dB soundscape treatments (@ 8 kHz) to green and rooibos teabags in compost in experimental mesocosms for 8 hours per day for 14 days to test whether acoustic stimulation affected fungal biomass and organic matter decomposition (a control mesocosm received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We played a monotone soundscape (80 dB @ 8 kHz) over five days to Trichoderma harzianum to assess whether this stimulation affected the growth rate and sporulation of this fungus (control samples received only ambient sound stimulation &lt;30 dB). We show that the acoustic stimulation treatments resulted in increased fungal biomass, greater decomposition, and enhanced T. harzianum conidia (spore) activity compared to controls. These results indicate that acoustic stimulation influences soil fungal growth and potentially facilitates their functioning. A piezoelectric effect and/or fungal mechanoreceptor stimulation are possible mechanisms. Our study highlights the potential of acoustic stimulation to alter important functional soil components, which could, with further development, be harnessed to aid ecosystem restoration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fifty-nine percent of the worlds species inhabit the soil. However, soils are degrading at unprecedented rates, necessitating efficient, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive biodiversity monitoring methods to aid in their restoration. Ecoacoustics is emerging as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring soil biodiversity, recently proving effective in a temperate forest restoration context. However, understanding the efficacy of soil ecoacoustics in other ecosystems and bioregions is essential. Here, we applied ecoacoustics tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Bioacoustic Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index) to measure soil biodiversity in an Australian grassy woodland restoration chronosequence. We collected 240 soil acoustic samples from two cleared plots (continuously cleared through active management), two woodland restoration plots (revegetated 14-15 years ago), and two remnant vegetation plots over 5 days at Mount Bold, South Australia. We used a below-ground sampling device and sound attenuation chamber to record soil invertebrate communities, which were also manually counted. We show that acoustic complexity and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated and remnant plots than in cleared plots, both in-situ and in sound attenuation chambers. Acoustic complexity and diversity were also strongly positively associated with soil invertebrate abundance and richness, and each chronosequence age class supported distinct invertebrate communities. Our results provide support that soil ecoacoustics can effectively measure soil biodiversity in woodland restoration contexts. This technology holds promise in addressing the global need for effective soil biodiversity monitoring methods and protecting our planets most diverse ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In urinary tract infections different bacteria can live in a polymicrobial community, it is unknown how such community members affect the conjugation rate of uropathogenic Escherichia coli. We investigated the influence of the polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI) community context on the conjugation rate of E. coli isolates in artificial urine medium. Pairwise conjugation rate experiments were conducted between a donor E. coli strain containing pOXA-48 and six uropathogenic E. coli isolates in the presence and absence of five community members to elucidate their effect on the rate of conjugation. We found that the basal conjugation rates in the absence of community members are genotype dependent. Interestingly, bacterial interactions have an overall positive effect on E. coli conjugation rates. Particularly Gram-positive enterococcal species were found to enhance the conjugation rates of most uropathogenic E. coli isolates. We hypothesize that the nature and co-culture of the interactions is important for these increased conjugation rates in AUM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Climate change is swiftly altering environmental winter conditions, leading to significant ecological impacts such as phenological shifts in many species. As a result, animals might face physiological mismatches due to longer or earlier activity periods and are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. Our study points for the first time to the complex physiological challenges that amphibians face as a result of changing thermal conditions due to winter climate change. We investigated the physiological responses to a period of warmer winter days and sudden spring freeze in the common toad (Bufo bufo) by acclimating them to 4{degrees}C or 8{degrees}C for 48 h or exposing them to 4{degrees}C or -2{degrees}C for 6 h, respectively. We assessed the daily energy demands, determined body condition and cold tolerance, explored the molecular responses to freezing through hepatic tissue transcriptome analysis, and measured blood glucose levels. Toads acclimated to higher temperatures showed a higher daily energy expenditure and a reduced cold tolerance suggesting faster depletion of energy stores and the loss of winter acclimation during warmer winters. Blood sugar levels were higher in frozen toads indicating the mobilization of cryoprotective glucose with freezing which was further supported by changed patterns in proteins related to glucose metabolism. Overall, our results emphasize that increased thermal variability incurs physiological costs that may reduce energy reserves and thus affect amphibian health and survival. This might pose a serious threat to breeding adults and may have subsequent effects at the population level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During long distance migration, many birds may experience periods of either prolonged fasting, during endurance flights, or extensive feeding during stopovers. It was previously shown that habitat selection during stopover can largely affect the migration outcome of an individual. Despite decades of research of the avian metabolism during stopover and migration, many questions have remained unanswered, as such research mainly focused on targeted metabolites and fat metabolism. Here, we examined the plasma-metabolome of migrating passerines prior to their crossing the Sahara Desert. Birds were sampled at two sites populated by Pistacia trees, bearing fat-rich fruits, and at an additional site dominated by blooming Eucalyptus trees. The blood samples were analyzed using both GC-MS and LC-MS, using an untargeted approach. We found that birds from one of the sites had a distinguish metabolic profile, suggesting recent landing. Examination of metabolic pathways activated during stopovers indicated a crucial role for cycling glucose through the Cori and Cahill cycles in resting and recovery processes. This novel perspective, conducted on free-ranging birds, suggests the evolution of avian insulin resistance due to factors such as endurance exercise, fasting, and a preference for fatty acid oxidation during migration, akin to cell trauma recovery. Additionally, we investigated inter-site variations in birds metabolic profiles. Significant variations were observed in both polar and lipophilic metabolites among the sites. Differences in polar metabolites were primarily attributed to variations in the physiological state of the birds between sites, while distinctions in the lipophilic profiles of rested birds were linked to variations in their primary food sources. This study underscores the challenge of interpreting commonly used indicators for assessing migrating birds physiological states and site quality, which are predominantly derived from lipid metabolism, in complex ecological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The central-marginal hypothesis predicts that genetic diversity decreases and genetic differentiation increases toward the species distribution margin. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) collected from different localities, including central and marginal populations, to test the hypothesis. The results show that the ayu populations at southern marginal habitats (Tien Yen River in Vietnam and Yakugachi River in Amami-oshima Island) displayed low genetic diversity (Haplotype diversity, H = 0.52 and 0.67; Nucleotide diversity, Pi = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively) and significantly differed from the central populations (p &lt; 0.001), consistent with the central-marginal hypothesis. However, ayu populations at the center of their distribution range (Shinano River in Honsyu and Hamoji River in Sado Island) and the northern marginal habitats (Yoichi River in Hokkaido and Aonae River in Okushiri Island) exhibited high genetic diversity (H = 1 for all rivers; Pi = 0.024-0.029). The genetic differences between the populations at the center and the northern marginal habitats were insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). This study showed that in ayu, the central-marginal hypothesis is valid in the southern direction but not in the northern direction. Urgent conservation is needed for the genetically distinct population in the degraded southern habitat with severely low genetic diversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInsecticide resistance and behavioural adaptation of malaria mosquitoes affect the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main tool for malaria vector control. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining exercise, we modelled a set of indicators of physiological resistance to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and behavioural resistance phenotypes (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote dIvoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multi-source and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of physiological resistance to insecticide and behavioural resistance phenotypes, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or behavioural resistance phenotypes : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the selection of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behaviour, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first modeling insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Sylvatub system is a national surveillance program established in 2011 in France to monitor infections caused by Mycobacterium bovis, the main etiologic agent of bovine tuberculosis, in wild species. This participatory program, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed us to monitor the progression of the infection in three badger populations in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2 from 2013 to 2019. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers in the same commune caused by local factors (e.g., social structure and proximity to infected farms). This model revealed that the prevalence increased with time in one cluster (Dordogne/Charentes), decreased in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remained stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all the clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of the animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for monitoring M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the program. We used the model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population that became infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were good approximations of these key quantities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interactions with microbial communities fundamentally shape metazoans physiology, development, and health across marine ecosystems. This is especially true in zooxanthellate (symbiotic algae-containing) cnidarians. In photosymbiotic anthozoans (eg. shallow water anemones and corals), the key members of the associated microbiota are increasingly well studied, but there is limited data on photosymbiotic scyphozoans (true jellyfish). Using 16S rRNA barcoding, we sampled the internal and external mucus of the zooxanthellate Upside- Down Jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana and C. andromeda, throughout eight sites covering the full length of the Florida Keys. We find these medusae to have low-diversity internal microbial communities distinct from the communities of their external surfaces and their environment. These internal communities are dominated by only three taxa: Endozoicomonadaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, and Vibrionaceae. External mucosal samples conform largely to the communities of surrounding sediment with the addition of Endozoicomonadaceae. The microbial taxa we identify associated with wild Florida Keys Cassiopea bear a strong resemblance to those found within photosymbiotic anthozoans, increasing the known links in ecological position between these groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Larval Lepidoptera gain survival advantages by aggregating, especially when combined with aposematic warning signals, yet reductions in predation risk may not be experienced equally across all group members. Hamiltons selfish herd theory predicts that larvae which surround themselves with their group mates should be at lower risk of predation, and those on the periphery of aggregations experience the greatest risk, yet this has rarely been tested. Here, we expose aggregations of artificial  caterpillar targets to predation from free-flying, wild birds to test for marginal predation when all prey are equally accessible, and for an interaction between warning colouration and marginal predation. We find that targets nearer the centre of the aggregation survived better than peripheral targets and nearby targets isolated from the group. However, there was no difference in survival between peripheral and isolated targets. We also find that grouped targets survived better than isolated targets when both are aposematic, but not when they are non-signalling. Our data suggest that avian predators preferentially target peripheral larvae from aggregations, and that prey warning signals enhance predator avoidance of groups.</p>
