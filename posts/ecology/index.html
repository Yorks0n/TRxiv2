E.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551397\nSpecies are often expected to shift their distributions poleward to evade warming climates. However, from 18 years of fixed transect monitoring data on 88 species of butterfly in the midwestern United States, we show that butterflies are shifting their centroids in all directions, except towards regions that are becoming warmer. Butterflies shifted their centroids at a mean rate of 4.87 km yr-1. The rate of centroid shift was significantly associated with local climate change velocity (temperature and precipitation), but not with mean climate change velocity throughout the species ranges. Surprisingly, the centroid shift was also unrelated to species traits expected to mediate the shift response including thermal niche breadth (range of climates butterflies experience throughout their distribution) and wingspan (often used as metric for dispersal capability). Contrasting with a number of previous studies, we observed relatively high phylogenetic signal in the rate and direction species shifted their centroids, suggesting that evolutionary history helps to explain multidirectional range shift responses and that some groups of species will be better able to shift their ranges than others. This research shows important signatures of multidirectional range shifts (latitudinal and longitudinal) and uniquely shows that local climate change velocities are more important in driving range shifts than the mean climate change velocity throughout a species entire range.\nStress response of fire salamander larvae differs between habitat types\nAuthors: Schulte, L.; Oswald, P.; Muehlenhaupt, M.; Ossendorf, E.; Kruse, S.; Kaiser, S.; Caspers, B. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552279\nDifferent habitats can impose varying selection pressures on individuals of the same species. Larvae of the European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) can inhabit two different habitats: streams and ponds. Streams are characterised by lower predation risk and intraspecific density and higher food availability than ponds. Thus, ponds are considered a less suitable habitat. To investigate the differential impacts of the two habitats on larval physiology, we measured the stress response of larvae living in the two different habitats. After successfully validating the measure of water-borne corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in fire salamander larvae, we measured the baseline and stress-induced CORT of 64 larvae from two pond and two stream locations in the field. We found larvae in ponds to be more stressed than larvae in streams. Additionally, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment and tested whether larvae can adapt their stress response to changing habitat conditions. After two weeks of transfer, we did not find an increase in CORT when comparing stress-induced CORT values with baseline CORT values in larvae transferred into ponds. However, larvae transferred into streams exhibited an increase in the stress-induced CORT response. Moreover, transfer into ponds as well as larvae originating from ponds showed reduced growth rates, indicating that ponds might be the more stressful habitat, as it negatively affected larval physiology. These results show that noninvasive hormone measurements can provide information on habitat quality and potential adaptation and thus emphasis the potential for its use in conservation efforts.\nDeclines in ice cover induce light limitation in freshwater diatoms\nAuthors: Zepernick, B. N.; Chase, E. E.; Denison, E. R.; Gilbert, N. E.; Martin, R. M.; Truchon, A. R.; Frenken, T.; Cody, W. R.; Chaffin, J. D.; Bullerjahn, G. S.; McKay, R. M.; Wilhelm, S. W.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551672\nThe rediscovery of diatom blooms embedded within and beneath Lake Erie ice cover (2007-2012) ignited an intense interest in psychrophilic adaptations and winter limnology. Subsequent studies determined ice plays a vital role in winter diatom ecophysiology, as diatoms partition to the underside of ice thereby fixing their location within the photic zone. Yet, climate change has led to widespread ice decline across the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie presenting a nearly ice-free state in several recent winters. It has been hypothesized the resultant turbid, isothermal water column will induce light limitation amongst winter diatoms, serving as a detrimental competitive disadvantage. Here, we conducted a physiochemical and metatranscriptomic survey of the winter Lake Erie water column (2019-2020) that spanned spatial, temporal, and climatic gradients to investigate this hypothesis. We determined ice-free conditions decreased diatom bloom magnitude and altered diatom community composition. Diatoms increased the expression of various photosynthetic genes and iron transporters, suggesting they are attempting to increase their quantity of photosystems and light-harvesting components (a well-defined indicator of light limitation). Notably, we identified two gene families which serve to increase diatom fitness in the turbid ice-free water column: proton-pumping rhodopsins (a second means of light-driven energy acquisition) and fasciclins (a means to \"raft\" together to increase buoyancy and co-locate to the surface to optimize light acquisition). With large-scale climatic changes already underway, our observations provide insight into how diatoms respond to the dynamic ice conditions of today and shed light on how they will fare in a climatically altered tomorrow.\nCosts of being a diet generalist in the super-generalist protist predator Dictyostelium discoideum\nAuthors: Shreenidhi, P. M.; Brock, D. A.; McCabe, R. I.; Strassmann, J. E.; Queller, D. C.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552129\nOrganisms can be classified as diet specialists or generalists based on the number of prey types they eat. Since different prey species have different constitutions and defenses, eating a wide variety of prey presents challenges. We explore three potential costs of generalism in a super-generalist amoeba predator, Dictyostelium discoideum, feeding on naturally co-occuring bacterial prey. First, we found that amoebas experience sub-optimal growth on many of their prey bacteria. Second, amoebas also exhibit a reduction in growth rate when they switch from one species of prey bacteria to another, something we call switching costs. These switching costs disappear within a day, indicating adjustment to new prey bacteria. Third, amoebas usually divide more slowly on mixtures of bacteria compared to their average on single bacteria, something we call concurrent costs. Our results support that idea that, although amoebas can consume a huge variety of prey, they must use partially different methods and thus must pay costs to handle multiple prey, either sequentially or simultaneously. Significance StatementPerhaps the most fundamental conflict in nature involves consumption of one organism by another. Diet generalists benefit from the advantage of eating many prey species but deal with many prey defences. We explore costs associated with a broad diet in a protist microbial predator, Dictyostelium discoideum. These predators of bacteria show a delay in growth when switched from one prey to another, supporting the hypothesis that they must deploy different strategies. They also experience costs when grown on many bacteria at once, suggesting that the alternative strategies for different prey are partly incompatible with each other. Our findings shed light on the nature of diet generalism and highlight the complexity of predation in the microbial world, where most organisms reside.\nIsolation and genomic characterization of the tick-borne relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia turicatae, from ticks collected in a peridomestic setting of Camayeca, Mexico\nAuthors: Vasquez-Guerrero, E.; Kneubehl, A.

E.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551332\nSurveillance studies were implemented in Sinaloa, Mexico to determine the circulation of tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes. Argasid ticks were collected from a human dwelling in the village of Camayeca and spirochetes were isolated. Genomic analysis indicated that Borrelia turicatae is a threat to those living in resource limited settings.

V.; Freeman, S.; Bacheler, N. M.; Shertzer, K.; Taylor, C.; Fieberg, J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551213\nO_LIIntegrated step-selection analyses (ISSAs) are frequently used to study animal movement and habitat selection. Methods for incorporating random effects in ISSAs have been developed, making it possible to quantify variability among animals in their space-use patterns. Although it is possible to model variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters, applications to date have focused on the former despite the widely acknowledged and important role that movement plays in determining ecological processes from the individual to ecosystem level. One potential explanation for this omission is the absence of readily-available software or examples demonstrating methods for estimating movement parameters in ISSAs with random effects. C_LIO_LITo demonstrate methods for characterizing among-individual variability in both movement and habitatselection parameters, we fit two models to an acoustic telemetry data set involving locations of 35 red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). In the first model, the distribution of snapper step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a categorical habitat variable indicating the type of benthic reef habitat the fish was located in at the start of the movement step. In the second model, step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a continuous variable measuring the distance between the fishs current location and nearest edge habitat. In both models, we also quantified habitat selection for different benthic habitat classes and distance to edge habitat at the end of the movement step. C_LIO_LIThere was substantial among-individual variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters. Nonetheless, most red snapper selected for high-relief hardbottom habitat and for locations nearer to edge habitat. They also moved less when in high-relief hardbottom habitat or when they were close to reef edges. Turn angles were frequently near {+/-} {pi}, but were more dispersed when fish were far away from edge habitat. C_LIO_LIWe provide code templates and functions for quantifying variability in movement and habitat-selection parameters when implementing ISSAs with random effects. In doing so, we hope to encourage ecologists conducting ISSAs to take full advantage of their ability to model among-individual variability in both habitat-selection and movement patterns.

B.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551543\nWhile the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys for biodiversity monitoring continues to be demonstrated, the spatial and temporal variability of eDNA, and thus the limits of the differentiability of an eDNA signal, remains under-characterized. In this study, we collected eDNA samples from distinct micro-habitats ([~]40 m apart) in a rocky intertidal ecosystem over their exposure period in a tidal cycle. During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses, using just taxonomically-assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats sampled. This differentiability paralleled ecological expectations and increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in the rocky intertidal only 40 m apart, that these differences are ecologically meaningful, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of differentiation possible. These findings showcase the potential power of eDNA biomonitoring to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of marine biodiversity data, aiding research, conservation, and management efforts.\nEstimating the reproduction number, R0, from agent-based models of tree disease spread\nAuthors: Wadkin, L. E.; Holden, J.; Ettelaie, R.; Holmes, M. J.; Smith, J.; Golightly, A.; Parker, N. G.; Baggaley, A. W.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551748\nTree populations worldwide are facing an unprecedented threat from a variety of tree diseases and invasive pests. Their spread, exacerbated by increasing globalisation and climate change, has an enormous environmental, economic and social impact. Computational agent-based models are a popular tool for describing and forecasting the spread of tree diseases due to their flexibility and ability to reveal collective behaviours. In this paper we present a versatile agentbased model with a Gaussian infectivity kernel to describe the spread of a generic tree disease through a synthetic treescape. We then explore several methods of calculating the basic reproduction number R0, a characteristic measurement of disease infectivity, defining the expected number of new infections resulting from one newly infected individual throughout their infectious period. It is a useful comparative summary parameter of a disease and can be used to explore the threshold dynamics of epidemics through mathematical models. We demonstrate several methods of estimating R0 through the agent-based model, including contact tracing, inferring the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model parameters using the linear noise approximation, and an analytical approximation. As an illustrative example, we then use the model and each of the methods to calculate estimates of R0 for the ash dieback epidemic in the UK.\nEnvironmental effects on reproductive performance in preindustrial women\nAuthors: Colejo Duran, L.; Pelletier, F.; Dillon, L.; Gagnon, A.; Bergeron, P.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552185\nEarly life environments can have long-lasting effects on adult reproductive performance, but disentangling the influence of early and adult life environments on fitness is challenging, especially for long-lived species. Using a detailed dataset spanning over two centuries, we studied how early and adult life environments impact reproductive performance in preindustrial women. We assessed the effect of environmental conditions associated with the parish of birth and the parish where the women had their offspring. We considered resource availability differences between rural, urban, northern, and southern parishes by comparing women who switched environments during their lifetime with those who did not. We found that urban-born women had an earlier age at first reproduction and lower offspring survival to adulthood than rural-born women, while South Quebec women had more offspring born than North Quebec women. Moreover, switching from urban to rural led to higher offspring survival, while the reverse had the opposite effect. In addition, moving from South to North resulted in fewer offspring born and surviving, whereas moving from North to South had the inverse effect. Finally, women who changed from rural to urban and from South to North had their first child at an older age compared to those who stayed in the same urbanity type. Our study underscores the complex and interactive effects of early and adult life environments on reproductive traits, highlighting the need to consider both when studying environmental effects on reproductive outcomes.\nMHC-B Diversity and Signs of Respiratory Illness in Wild, East African Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii)\nAuthors: Phillips, S. R.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551731\nMany traits, intrinsic and extrinsic to an organism, contribute to interindividual variation in immunity in wild habitats. The vertebrate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) includes genes encoding antigen-presenting molecules that are highly variable, and that variation often predicts susceptibility/resistance to and recovery from pathogen infection. I compare MHC-B variation at two long-term chimpanzee research sites, Kibale National Park in Uganda and Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Using decades of respiratory health data available for these chimpanzees, I test hypotheses associated with maintenance of diversity at MHC loci, including heterozygote, divergent allele, and rare allele advantage hypotheses, and predictions for unique function of MHC-B in great apes. I found, despite confirmation of recent shared ancestry between Kibale and Gombe chimpanzees, including an overlapping MHC-B allele repertoire and similar MHC-B phenotype compositions, chimpanzees from the two research sites experienced differences in the occurrence of respiratory signs and had different associations of MHC-B diversity with signs of respiratory illness. Kibale chimpanzees with heterozygous genotypes and different peptide-binding supertypes were observed less often with respiratory signs than those homozygous or possessing the same supertypes, but this same association was not observed among Gombe chimpanzees. Gombe chimpanzees with specific MHC-B phenotypes that enable engagement of Natural Killer (NK) cells were observed more often with respiratory signs than chimpanzees with other phenotypes, but this was not observed at Kanyawara. This study emphasizes local adaptation in shaping genetic and phenotypic traits in different infectious disease contexts, even among close genetic relatives of the same subspecies, and highlights utility for continued and simultaneous tracking of host immune genes and specific pathogens in wild species.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Species are often expected to shift their distributions poleward to evade warming climates. However, from 18 years of fixed transect monitoring data on 88 species of butterfly in the midwestern United States, we show that butterflies are shifting their centroids in all directions, except towards regions that are becoming warmer. Butterflies shifted their centroids at a mean rate of 4.87 km yr-1. The rate of centroid shift was significantly associated with local climate change velocity (temperature and precipitation), but not with mean climate change velocity throughout the species ranges. Surprisingly, the centroid shift was also unrelated to species traits expected to mediate the shift response including thermal niche breadth (range of climates butterflies experience throughout their distribution) and wingspan (often used as metric for dispersal capability). Contrasting with a number of previous studies, we observed relatively high phylogenetic signal in the rate and direction species shifted their centroids, suggesting that evolutionary history helps to explain multidirectional range shift responses and that some groups of species will be better able to shift their ranges than others. This research shows important signatures of multidirectional range shifts (latitudinal and longitudinal) and uniquely shows that local climate change velocities are more important in driving range shifts than the mean climate change velocity throughout a species entire range.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Different habitats can impose varying selection pressures on individuals of the same species. Larvae of the European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) can inhabit two different habitats: streams and ponds. Streams are characterised by lower predation risk and intraspecific density and higher food availability than ponds. Thus, ponds are considered a less suitable habitat. To investigate the differential impacts of the two habitats on larval physiology, we measured the stress response of larvae living in the two different habitats. After successfully validating the measure of water-borne corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in fire salamander larvae, we measured the baseline and stress-induced CORT of 64 larvae from two pond and two stream locations in the field. We found larvae in ponds to be more stressed than larvae in streams. Additionally, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment and tested whether larvae can adapt their stress response to changing habitat conditions. After two weeks of transfer, we did not find an increase in CORT when comparing stress-induced CORT values with baseline CORT values in larvae transferred into ponds. However, larvae transferred into streams exhibited an increase in the stress-induced CORT response. Moreover, transfer into ponds as well as larvae originating from ponds showed reduced growth rates, indicating that ponds might be the more stressful habitat, as it negatively affected larval physiology. These results show that noninvasive hormone measurements can provide information on habitat quality and potential adaptation and thus emphasis the potential for its use in conservation efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rediscovery of diatom blooms embedded within and beneath Lake Erie ice cover (2007-2012) ignited an intense interest in psychrophilic adaptations and winter limnology. Subsequent studies determined ice plays a vital role in winter diatom ecophysiology, as diatoms partition to the underside of ice thereby fixing their location within the photic zone. Yet, climate change has led to widespread ice decline across the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie presenting a nearly ice-free state in several recent winters. It has been hypothesized the resultant turbid, isothermal water column will induce light limitation amongst winter diatoms, serving as a detrimental competitive disadvantage. Here, we conducted a physiochemical and metatranscriptomic survey of the winter Lake Erie water column (2019-2020) that spanned spatial, temporal, and climatic gradients to investigate this hypothesis. We determined ice-free conditions decreased diatom bloom magnitude and altered diatom community composition. Diatoms increased the expression of various photosynthetic genes and iron transporters, suggesting they are attempting to increase their quantity of photosystems and light-harvesting components (a well-defined indicator of light limitation). Notably, we identified two gene families which serve to increase diatom fitness in the turbid ice-free water column: proton-pumping rhodopsins (a second means of light-driven energy acquisition) and fasciclins (a means to &#34;raft&#34; together to increase buoyancy and co-locate to the surface to optimize light acquisition). With large-scale climatic changes already underway, our observations provide insight into how diatoms respond to the dynamic ice conditions of today and shed light on how they will fare in a climatically altered tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms can be classified as diet specialists or generalists based on the number of prey types they eat. Since different prey species have different constitutions and defenses, eating a wide variety of prey presents challenges. We explore three potential costs of generalism in a super-generalist amoeba predator, Dictyostelium discoideum, feeding on naturally co-occuring bacterial prey. First, we found that amoebas experience sub-optimal growth on many of their prey bacteria. Second, amoebas also exhibit a reduction in growth rate when they switch from one species of prey bacteria to another, something we call switching costs. These switching costs disappear within a day, indicating adjustment to new prey bacteria. Third, amoebas usually divide more slowly on mixtures of bacteria compared to their average on single bacteria, something we call concurrent costs. Our results support that idea that, although amoebas can consume a huge variety of prey, they must use partially different methods and thus must pay costs to handle multiple prey, either sequentially or simultaneously.

Significance StatementPerhaps the most fundamental conflict in nature involves consumption of one organism by another. Diet generalists benefit from the advantage of eating many prey species but deal with many prey defences. We explore costs associated with a broad diet in a protist microbial predator, Dictyostelium discoideum. These predators of bacteria show a delay in growth when switched from one prey to another, supporting the hypothesis that they must deploy different strategies. They also experience costs when grown on many bacteria at once, suggesting that the alternative strategies for different prey are partly incompatible with each other. Our findings shed light on the nature of diet generalism and highlight the complexity of predation in the microbial world, where most organisms reside.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIntegrated step-selection analyses (ISSAs) are frequently used to study animal movement and habitat selection. Methods for incorporating random effects in ISSAs have been developed, making it possible to quantify variability among animals in their space-use patterns. Although it is possible to model variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters, applications to date have focused on the former despite the widely acknowledged and important role that movement plays in determining ecological processes from the individual to ecosystem level. One potential explanation for this omission is the absence of readily-available software or examples demonstrating methods for estimating movement parameters in ISSAs with random effects.
C_LIO_LITo demonstrate methods for characterizing among-individual variability in both movement and habitatselection parameters, we fit two models to an acoustic telemetry data set involving locations of 35 red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). In the first model, the distribution of snapper step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a categorical habitat variable indicating the type of benthic reef habitat the fish was located in at the start of the movement step. In the second model, step lengths and turn angles were assumed to depend on a continuous variable measuring the distance between the fishs current location and nearest edge habitat. In both models, we also quantified habitat selection for different benthic habitat classes and distance to edge habitat at the end of the movement step.
C_LIO_LIThere was substantial among-individual variability in both habitat selection and movement parameters. Nonetheless, most red snapper selected for high-relief hardbottom habitat and for locations nearer to edge habitat. They also moved less when in high-relief hardbottom habitat or when they were close to reef edges. Turn angles were frequently near {&#43;/-} {pi}, but were more dispersed when fish were far away from edge habitat.
C_LIO_LIWe provide code templates and functions for quantifying variability in movement and habitat-selection parameters when implementing ISSAs with random effects. In doing so, we hope to encourage ecologists conducting ISSAs to take full advantage of their ability to model among-individual variability in both habitat-selection and movement patterns.

        <p class="abstract">While the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys for biodiversity monitoring continues to be demonstrated, the spatial and temporal variability of eDNA, and thus the limits of the differentiability of an eDNA signal, remains under-characterized. In this study, we collected eDNA samples from distinct micro-habitats ([~]40 m apart) in a rocky intertidal ecosystem over their exposure period in a tidal cycle. During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses, using just taxonomically-assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats sampled. This differentiability paralleled ecological expectations and increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in the rocky intertidal only 40 m apart, that these differences are ecologically meaningful, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of differentiation possible. These findings showcase the potential power of eDNA biomonitoring to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of marine biodiversity data, aiding research, conservation, and management efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tree populations worldwide are facing an unprecedented threat from a variety of tree diseases and invasive pests. Their spread, exacerbated by increasing globalisation and climate change, has an enormous environmental, economic and social impact. Computational agent-based models are a popular tool for describing and forecasting the spread of tree diseases due to their flexibility and ability to reveal collective behaviours. In this paper we present a versatile agentbased model with a Gaussian infectivity kernel to describe the spread of a generic tree disease through a synthetic treescape. We then explore several methods of calculating the basic reproduction number R0, a characteristic measurement of disease infectivity, defining the expected number of new infections resulting from one newly infected individual throughout their infectious period. It is a useful comparative summary parameter of a disease and can be used to explore the threshold dynamics of epidemics through mathematical models. We demonstrate several methods of estimating R0 through the agent-based model, including contact tracing, inferring the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model parameters using the linear noise approximation, and an analytical approximation. As an illustrative example, we then use the model and each of the methods to calculate estimates of R0 for the ash dieback epidemic in the UK.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early life environments can have long-lasting effects on adult reproductive performance, but disentangling the influence of early and adult life environments on fitness is challenging, especially for long-lived species. Using a detailed dataset spanning over two centuries, we studied how early and adult life environments impact reproductive performance in preindustrial women. We assessed the effect of environmental conditions associated with the parish of birth and the parish where the women had their offspring. We considered resource availability differences between rural, urban, northern, and southern parishes by comparing women who switched environments during their lifetime with those who did not. We found that urban-born women had an earlier age at first reproduction and lower offspring survival to adulthood than rural-born women, while South Quebec women had more offspring born than North Quebec women. Moreover, switching from urban to rural led to higher offspring survival, while the reverse had the opposite effect. In addition, moving from South to North resulted in fewer offspring born and surviving, whereas moving from North to South had the inverse effect. Finally, women who changed from rural to urban and from South to North had their first child at an older age compared to those who stayed in the same urbanity type. Our study underscores the complex and interactive effects of early and adult life environments on reproductive traits, highlighting the need to consider both when studying environmental effects on reproductive outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many traits, intrinsic and extrinsic to an organism, contribute to interindividual variation in immunity in wild habitats. The vertebrate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) includes genes encoding antigen-presenting molecules that are highly variable, and that variation often predicts susceptibility/resistance to and recovery from pathogen infection. I compare MHC-B variation at two long-term chimpanzee research sites, Kibale National Park in Uganda and Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Using decades of respiratory health data available for these chimpanzees, I test hypotheses associated with maintenance of diversity at MHC loci, including heterozygote, divergent allele, and rare allele advantage hypotheses, and predictions for unique function of MHC-B in great apes. I found, despite confirmation of recent shared ancestry between Kibale and Gombe chimpanzees, including an overlapping MHC-B allele repertoire and similar MHC-B phenotype compositions, chimpanzees from the two research sites experienced differences in the occurrence of respiratory signs and had different associations of MHC-B diversity with signs of respiratory illness. Kibale chimpanzees with heterozygous genotypes and different peptide-binding supertypes were observed less often with respiratory signs than those homozygous or possessing the same supertypes, but this same association was not observed among Gombe chimpanzees. Gombe chimpanzees with specific MHC-B phenotypes that enable engagement of Natural Killer (NK) cells were observed more often with respiratory signs than chimpanzees with other phenotypes, but this was not observed at Kanyawara. This study emphasizes local adaptation in shaping genetic and phenotypic traits in different infectious disease contexts, even among close genetic relatives of the same subspecies, and highlights utility for continued and simultaneous tracking of host immune genes and specific pathogens in wild species.</p>
