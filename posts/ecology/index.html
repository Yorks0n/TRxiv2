Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research. One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.\nUnveiling the ecology, taxonomy and metabolic capabilities of MBA03, a potential key player in anaerobic digestion\nAuthors: Puchol-Royo, R.; Pascual, J.; Ortega-Legarreta, A.; Otto, P.; Tideman, J.; de Vries, S.-J.; Abendroth, C.; Tanner, K.; Porcar, M.; Latorre-Perez, A.\nScore: 36.2, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556800\nBiogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.\nPeriodic shifts in viral load increase risk of spillover from bats\nAuthors: Lunn, T. J.; Borremans, B.; Jones, D. N.; Kessler, M. K.; Dale, A. S.; Yinda, K. C.; Ruiz-Aravena, M.; Falvo, C. A.; Crowley, D.; Lloyd-Smith, J. O.; Munster, V. J.; Eby, P.; McCallum, H.; Hudson, P.; Restif, O.; McGuire, L. P.; Smith, I. L.; Bat One Health Group, ; Plowright, R. K.; Peel, A. J.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556454\nPrediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.\nThe demographic history of the wild crop relative Brachypodium distachyon is shaped by distinct past and present ecological niches.\nAuthors: Minadakis, N.; Williams, H.; Horvath, R.; Cakovic, D.; Stritt, C.; Thieme, M.; Bourgeois, Y. X. C.; Roulin, A.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543285\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClosely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a fifth of the worlds dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.\nToward a synthesis of phytoplankton community composition methods for global-scale application\nAuthors: Kramer, S.

A.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556589\nThe composition of the marine phytoplankton community has been shown to impact many biogeochemical processes and marine ecosystem services. A variety of methods exist to characterize phytoplankton community composition (PCC), with varying degrees of taxonomic resolution. Accordingly, the resulting PCC determinations are dependent on the method used. Here, we use surface ocean samples collected in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans to compare high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment-based PCC to four other methods: quantitative cell imaging, flow cytometry, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. These methods allow characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic PCC across a wide range of size classes. PCC estimates of many taxa resolved at the class level (e.g., diatoms) show strong positive correlations across methods, while other groups (e.g., dinoflagellates) are not well captured by one or more methods. Since variations in phytoplankton pigment concentrations are related to changes in optical properties, this combined dataset expands the potential scope of ocean color remote sensing by associating PCC at the genus- and species-level with group- or class-level PCC from pigments. Quantifying the strengths and limitations of pigment-based PCC methods compared to PCC assessments from amplicon sequencing, imaging, and cytometry methods is the first step toward the robust validation of remote sensing approaches to quantify PCC from space.\nTowards interpretable learned representations for Ecoacoustics using variational auto-encoding\nAuthors: Gibb, K. A.; Eldridge, A.; Sandom, C. J.; Simpson, I. J. A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556690\nEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm - a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) - to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardware's frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.\nMGDrivE 3: A decoupled vector-human framework for epidemiological simulation of mosquito genetic control tools and their surveillance\nAuthors: Mondal, A.; Sanchez C., H. M.; Marshall, J. M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556958\nNovel mosquito genetic control tools, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, hold great promise in reducing the global burden of vector-borne diseases. As these technologies advance through the research and development pipeline, there is a growing need for modeling frameworks incorporating increasing levels of entomological and epidemiological detail in order to address questions regarding logistics and biosafety. Epidemiological predictions are becoming increasingly relevant to the development of target product profiles and the design of field trials and interventions, while entomological surveillance is becoming increasingly important to regulation and biosafety. We present MGDrivE 3 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 3), a new version of a previously-developed framework, MGDrivE 2, that investigates the spatial population dynamics of mosquito genetic control systems and their epidemiological implications. The new framework incorporates three major developments: i) a decoupled sampling algorithm allowing the vector portion of the MGDrivE framework to be paired with a more detailed epidemiological framework, ii) a version of the Imperial College London malaria transmission model, which incorporates age structure, various forms of immunity, and human and vector interventions, and iii) a surveillance module that tracks mosquitoes captured by traps throughout the simulation. Example MGDrivE 3 simulations are presented demonstrating the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based homing gene drive linked to dual disease-refractory genes and their potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. Simulations are also presented demonstrating surveillance of such a system by a network of mosquito traps. MGDrivE 3 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MGDrivE2) (version 2.1.0), and extensive examples and vignettes are provided. We intend the software to aid in understanding of human health impacts and biosafety of mosquito genetic control tools, and continue to iterate per feedback from the genetic control community.\nA taxonomy of multiple stable states in complex ecological communities\nAuthors: Aguade-Gorgorio, G.; Arnoldi, J.-F.; Barbier, M.; Kefi, S.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555051\nMany natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.\nEffects of forest urbanization on the interplay between small mammal communities and their gut microbiota\nAuthors: Bouilloud, M.; Galan, M.; Pradel, J.; Loiseau, A.; FERRERO, J.; Gallet, R.; Roche, B.; Charbonnel, N.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556680\nUrbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.\nAssessing the links between pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic features of plant species with contrasting distribution ranges\nAuthors: Valverde, J.; Medrano, M.; Herrera, C. M.; Alonso, C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556048\nIn flowering plants, pollinators contribute to gene flow while they also respond to variation in plant traits together determined by genetic, epigenetic and environmental sources of variation. Consequently, a correlation between abundance and diversity of pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of plant populations such as diversity or distinctiveness is to be expected, yet no study has explored such long-term dimensions of plant-pollinator interactions. Mediterranean narrow endemics often exhibit unexpectedly high levels of population (epi)genetic diversity. We hypothesize that pollinators may contribute to explain this pattern. Specifically, we expect a stronger association of pollinators with population (epi)genetic variability in narrow endemics than in widely distributed congeners. We studied five pairs of congeneric plant species, consisting of one narrow endemic with a restricted distribution and one widespread congener, found in the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (SE Spain). In up to three populations per species, a comprehensive characterisation of pollinators was carried out to estimate pollinator diversity and visitation rate. Genetic and epigenetic diversity and distinctiveness of each population was calculated using AFLP markers and methylation-sensitive AFLP markers (MSAP) respectively. The relationships with pollinator diversity and visitation rate were assessed. The diversity of pollinators did not vary according to the plant distribution range, whereas visitation rate was higher in widespread species. As predicted, only narrow endemics showed a significant association between pollinators and their population genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Specifically, higher pollinator diversity and visitation rates entailed higher population genetic diversity and lower epigenetic distinctiveness. This work shows the value of exploring the relationships between pollinator abundance and diversity and population (epi)genetics for understanding the evolution of plant rarity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mounting evidence shows insects are in decline globally. Habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides have all been implicated, but their relative effects have never been evaluated in a comprehensive large-scale study. We harmonized 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides and butterfly data across 60 counties in five states in the US Midwest. We find community-wide declines in butterfly abundance to be most strongly associated with pesticides in general and the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in particular. This included the abundance of the migratory monarch (Danaus plexippus), whose decline is the focus of intensive debate and public concern. Insect declines cannot be understood without comprehensive data on all putative drivers, and the 2015 cessation of neonicotinoid data releases in the US will impede future research.

One Sentence SummaryShifts in insecticide use towards neonicotinoid-treated seeds are associated with an 8 percent decline in butterfly species diversity across the American Corn Belt.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClosely related to economically important crops, the grass Brachypodium distachyon has been originally established as a pivotal species for grass genomics but more recently flourished as a model for developmental biology. Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a fifth of the worlds dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource offers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more specifically in monocots.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The composition of the marine phytoplankton community has been shown to impact many biogeochemical processes and marine ecosystem services. A variety of methods exist to characterize phytoplankton community composition (PCC), with varying degrees of taxonomic resolution. Accordingly, the resulting PCC determinations are dependent on the method used. Here, we use surface ocean samples collected in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans to compare high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment-based PCC to four other methods: quantitative cell imaging, flow cytometry, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. These methods allow characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic PCC across a wide range of size classes. PCC estimates of many taxa resolved at the class level (e.g., diatoms) show strong positive correlations across methods, while other groups (e.g., dinoflagellates) are not well captured by one or more methods. Since variations in phytoplankton pigment concentrations are related to changes in optical properties, this combined dataset expands the potential scope of ocean color remote sensing by associating PCC at the genus- and species-level with group- or class-level PCC from pigments. Quantifying the strengths and limitations of pigment-based PCC methods compared to PCC assessments from amplicon sequencing, imaging, and cytometry methods is the first step toward the robust validation of remote sensing approaches to quantify PCC from space.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ecoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm - a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) - to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardware&#39;s frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Novel mosquito genetic control tools, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, hold great promise in reducing the global burden of vector-borne diseases. As these technologies advance through the research and development pipeline, there is a growing need for modeling frameworks incorporating increasing levels of entomological and epidemiological detail in order to address questions regarding logistics and biosafety. Epidemiological predictions are becoming increasingly relevant to the development of target product profiles and the design of field trials and interventions, while entomological surveillance is becoming increasingly important to regulation and biosafety. We present MGDrivE 3 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 3), a new version of a previously-developed framework, MGDrivE 2, that investigates the spatial population dynamics of mosquito genetic control systems and their epidemiological implications. The new framework incorporates three major developments: i) a decoupled sampling algorithm allowing the vector portion of the MGDrivE framework to be paired with a more detailed epidemiological framework, ii) a version of the Imperial College London malaria transmission model, which incorporates age structure, various forms of immunity, and human and vector interventions, and iii) a surveillance module that tracks mosquitoes captured by traps throughout the simulation. Example MGDrivE 3 simulations are presented demonstrating the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based homing gene drive linked to dual disease-refractory genes and their potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. Simulations are also presented demonstrating surveillance of such a system by a network of mosquito traps. MGDrivE 3 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MGDrivE2) (version 2.1.0), and extensive examples and vignettes are provided. We intend the software to aid in understanding of human health impacts and biosafety of mosquito genetic control tools, and continue to iterate per feedback from the genetic control community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many natural and man-made systems, from financial markets to ecosystems or the human brain, are built from multiple interconnected units. This complex high-dimensionality hinders our capacity to understand and predict the dynamics, functioning and fragility of these systems. One fragility scenario, particularly relevant to ecological communities of interacting species, concerns so-called regime shifts: abrupt and unexpected transitions from healthy, species-rich communities towards states of degraded ecosystem function and services. The accepted explanation for these shifts is that they arise as abrupt transitions between alternative stable states: multiple stable configurations of a system under the same internal and external conditions. These alternative states are well-understood in low-dimensional systems, but how they upscale with system complexity remains a debated question. In the present work we investigate the emergence of multiple stable states in a number of complex system models. We find that high-dimensional models with random interactions can unfold at least four different regimes of multistability, each emerging under a specific interaction scheme. More importantly, each multistability regime leaves a distinct and quantifiable fingerprint, providing a framework to analyze experimental evidence of abrupt shifts. By bridging previous results and studying multistability regimes, their fingerprints and their correlation with empirical evidence in ecology, our study helps define a common ground to understand and classify multiple stable states in complex systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In flowering plants, pollinators contribute to gene flow while they also respond to variation in plant traits together determined by genetic, epigenetic and environmental sources of variation. Consequently, a correlation between abundance and diversity of pollinators and the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of plant populations such as diversity or distinctiveness is to be expected, yet no study has explored such long-term dimensions of plant-pollinator interactions. Mediterranean narrow endemics often exhibit unexpectedly high levels of population (epi)genetic diversity. We hypothesize that pollinators may contribute to explain this pattern. Specifically, we expect a stronger association of pollinators with population (epi)genetic variability in narrow endemics than in widely distributed congeners. We studied five pairs of congeneric plant species, consisting of one narrow endemic with a restricted distribution and one widespread congener, found in the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (SE Spain). In up to three populations per species, a comprehensive characterisation of pollinators was carried out to estimate pollinator diversity and visitation rate. Genetic and epigenetic diversity and distinctiveness of each population was calculated using AFLP markers and methylation-sensitive AFLP markers (MSAP) respectively. The relationships with pollinator diversity and visitation rate were assessed. The diversity of pollinators did not vary according to the plant distribution range, whereas visitation rate was higher in widespread species. As predicted, only narrow endemics showed a significant association between pollinators and their population genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Specifically, higher pollinator diversity and visitation rates entailed higher population genetic diversity and lower epigenetic distinctiveness. This work shows the value of exploring the relationships between pollinator abundance and diversity and population (epi)genetics for understanding the evolution of plant rarity.</p>
