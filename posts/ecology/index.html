E.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568124\nPest insects and microbial pathogens threaten agricultural crop productivity and global forest biomes, and insect-microbe interactions can increase the severity of plant decline. Whilst bacterial chemicals have been shown to influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived chemistries on phytopathogens is barely understood. Here, we investigated beetle larvae-bacteria interactions in acute oak decline (AOD), a decline disease of oak characterised by inner bark necrosis caused by a polymicrobial consortium including Brenneria goodwinii and larval galleries of Agrilus biguttatus. To test the hypothesis that larval chemicals influence the activity of B. goodwinii, we extracted A. biguttatus larvae and tested the effect of extracts on the growth and gene expression of B. goodwinii in vitro. We demonstrate that larval chemicals elicit increased bacterial growth rate and final cell density, as well as differential expression of almost 800 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, major virulence factors in other plant pathogens. Contrastingly, gallery woody-tissue extracts induced no such effects. Our work highlights the importance of multi-kingdom interactions in plant disease and demonstrate a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens, which may be important in understanding plant diseases globally.\nA general framework for modeling pathogen transmission in co-roosting host communities\nAuthors: Simonis, M. C.; Becker, D.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568148\nCross-species transmission of pathogens can be facilitated by frequent contact among wildlife. Cross-species transmission is often driven by phylogenetic similarity between host species, but the role this plays when multiple host species co-roost is unknown. We developed a generalizable framework for understanding how cross-species transmission is driven by contact among co-roosting species spanning evolutionary similarities and the net impact on roost-level infection prevalence. We developed ordinary differential equation models describing population and infection dynamics between two and three co-roosting species. We parameterized models using co-roosting Neotropical bat systems, with interspecific transmission exponentially declining with phylogenetic distance. To assess the relative contribution of contact rates and phylogenetic similarity, we co-varied intraspecific transmission rates and phylogenetic distances while considering sensitivity to host and pathogen traits. While our models converged on similar equilibria under high intraspecific transmission or long durations of infection and immunity or latency, simulations with lower intraspecific transmission and shorter such periods revealed roost-level prevalence was greatest when hosts were most closely related. However, we identified regions of parameter space where roost-level prevalence also maximized when hosts were distantly related, driven by species-specific traits. Our generalizable models are adaptable to other co-roosting systems and informs our understanding of pathogen spillover.\nThermal biology of bee pollinators: diversity and community-level correlates\nAuthors: Herrera, C. M.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568883\nCommunity-wide assembly of plant-pollinator systems depends on an intricate combination of biotic and abiotic factors, including heterogeneity among pollinators in thermal biology and responses to abiotic environmental gradients. Studies on the thermal biology of pollinators, however, have mostly considered only one or a few species of plants or pollinators at a time, and the possible driving role of the diversity in thermal biology of pollinator asemblages at the plant community level thus remains largely unexplored. More specifically, it is unknown whether expected diversity in the thermal biology of bees, a major, species-rich pollinator group worldwide, contributes to the assembly and maintenance of diverse bee communities, broadens the spectrum of possibilities available to bee-pollinated plants, facilitate interspecific partitioning of ecological gradients across habitats, seasons and time of day, and/or enhance plant pollination success through complementarity effects. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity in thermal biology of the bee assemblage pollinating the community of entomophilous plants from a Mediterranean montane area, and to elucidate whether there existed seasonal, daily, between-habitat or floral visitation correlates of bee thermal biology which could contribute to partition ecological gradients among plant and bee species. Thermal biology parameters were obtained in the laboratory (K, intrinsic warming constant) and the field (thoracic and ambient temperature at foraging site, Tth and Tair) on individual bees of a diverse sample (N = 204 bee species) comprising most bee pollinators of the regional plant community. Species-specific thermal biology parameters were combined with quantitative field data on bee pollinators and flower visitation for the regional community of entomophilous plants (N = 292 plant species). Results revealed that the regional bee assemblage harbored considerable diversity in thermal biology features, that such diversity was mostly taxonomically and body-size structured, and that the broad interspecific heterogeneity in thermal biology represented in the bee community as a whole eventually translated into daily, seasonal, among-habitat and flower visitation patterns at the plant community level. This lends support to the hypothesis that broad diversity in thermal biology of bees can act enhancing opportunities for bee coexistence, spatio-temporal partitioning of floral resources, and plant pollination success.

Therefore, monitoring its distribution and better understanding both the species threatened and the mechanics of infection are essential in mitigating the damage Bsal may cause. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for detecting both this fungal pathogen and the amphibian communities in infected areas. We applied these methods in the province Gelderland, the Netherlands where the pathogen has previously been detected and is expanding its range, with the goal of detecting the natural amphibian community present. We sampled 27 water bodies in the region surrounding the known outbreak sites. We used data from a Bsal-specific qPCR assay to determine its presence-absence and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the amphibian communities using two different primer sets. The 12S vertebrate primer set outperformed the 16S amphibian primer set and detected all the expected amphibians in the study area: Bufo bufo, Lissotriton vulgaris, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax spp., Rana temporaria and Triturus cristatus. Bsal was detected at eight of the ponds. A distance-based redundancy analysis found a weak but significant relationship between Bsal presence and the composition of amphibian communities using eDNA. This study provides the foundation for future studies on Bsal and its relationship with amphibian communities in Europe, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms of persistence and transmission between water bodies.\nrsofun: A model-data integration framework for simulating ecosystem processes\nAuthors: Aran Paredes, J.; Hufkens, K.; Stocker, B.

M.; McIlvin, M. R.; Lopez, P. Z.; Barth, A.; Stone, J.; Alanis, B. A.; Chan, E. W.; Breier, J. A.; Jakuba, M. V.; Johnson, R.; Alexander, H.; Saito, M. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567900\nProtists (microeukaryotes) are key contributors to marine carbon cycling, influencing the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels and the vertical movement of carbon to the ocean interior. Their physiology, ecology, and interactions with the chemical environment are still poorly understood in offshore ecosystems, and especially in the deep ocean. Using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Clio, the microbial community along a 1,050 km transect in the western North Atlantic Ocean was surveyed at 10-200 m vertical depth increments to capture metabolic microeukaryote signatures spanning a gradient of oligotrophic, continental margin, and productive coastal ecosystems. Plankton biomass was collected along the surface of this transect and across depth features, and taxonomy and metabolic function were examined using a paired metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic approach. A shift in the microeukaryote community composition was observed from the euphotic zone through the mesopelagic and into the bathypelagic ocean. A diverse surface assemblage consisting of haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and ciliates was represented in both the transcript and protein fractions, with foraminifera, radiolaria, picozoa, and discoba proteins enriched at \u003e200 m depth, and fungal proteins emerging in waters \u003e3,000 m depth. In the broad microeukaryote community, nitrogen stress biomarkers were found in productive coastal sites, with phosphorus stress biomarkers in offshore waters where Saharan dust input is thought to supply iron and nitrogen. This multi-omics dataset broadens our understanding of how microeukaryotic taxa and their functional processes are structured along environmental gradients of temperature, light, macronutrients, and trace metals.\nGlobal patterns in gene content of soil microbiomes emerge from microbial interactions\nAuthors: Crocker, K.; Lee, K. K.; Chakraverti-Wuerthwein, M.; Li, Z.; Tikhonov, M.; Mani, M.; Gowda, K.; Kuehn, S.\nScore: 22.0, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.31.542950\nMicrobial metabolism sustains life on Earth. Sequencing surveys of communities in hosts, oceans, and soils have revealed ubiquitous patterns linking the microbes present, the genes they possess, and local environmental conditions. One prominent explanation for these patterns is environmental filtering: local conditions select strains with particular traits. However, filtering assumes ecological interactions do not influence patterns, despite the fact that interactions can and do play an important role in structuring communities. Here, we demonstrate the insufficiency of the environmental filtering hypothesis for explaining global patterns in topsoil microbiomes. Using denitrification as a model system, we find that the abundances of two characteristic genotypes trade-off with pH; nar gene abundances increase while nap abundances decrease with declining pH. Contradicting the filtering hypothesis, we show that strains possessing the Nar genotype are enriched in low pH conditions but fail to grow alone. Instead, the dominance of Nar genotypes at low pH arises from an ecological interaction with Nap genotypes that alleviates nitrite toxicity. Our study provides a roadmap for dissecting how global associations between environmental variables and gene abundances arise from environmentally modulated community interactions.\nSpatially explicit sampling frameworks to identify regions of increased mosquito abundance\nAuthors: Kemei, B.; Ochomo, E.; Ombok, M.; Midega, J.; Lucas, E. R.; Donnelly, M. J.; Sedda, L.; McDermott, D. P.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568008\nVector control interventions often lack comprehensive information on vector population distribution and dynamics. This knowledge gap poses challenges in targeting interventions effectively, especially in areas with heterogeneous transmission and where complementary vector control tools may be required to achieve sustained impact on disease transmission. In this study, we implemented a spatially explicit sampling framework for improved vector surveillance in coastal Kenya. Our stratified lattice with close pair sampling design aimed to characterise the vector dynamics of the primary malaria-transmitting species in the area and assess the ecotype classifications effectiveness at identifying clear population patterns. The study collected 3,621 mosquitoes, with An. funestus s.l. being the most abundant malaria vector. The inclusion of the ecotype classification significantly improved spatial abundance model estimates for An. gambiae and Culex spp. Wetlands, topographic wetness index, and proximity to rivers were associated with increased mosquito abundance. Spatial modelling revealed high abundance regions near the Galana-Sabaki River. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a reproducible spatial sampling approach to identify areas with high vector abundance and inform targeted vector control strategies. The study highlights the importance of ecological stratification and a spatial explicit sampling approach for predicting mosquito presence when prior data is limited and underscores the potential for refining future sampling for control efforts.\nFlower visitor groups show differential responses to individual and plot-level chemodiversity with consequences for plant fitness\nAuthors: Sasidharan, R.; Grond, S. G.; Champion, S.; Eilers, E. J.; Mueller, C.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568056\nO_LIChemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood. C_LIO_LIThis study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined. C_LIO_LIOur findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type. C_LIO_LISynthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments. C_LI\nSeedling microbiota engineering using bacterial synthetic community inoculation on seeds\nAuthors: Arnault, G.; Marais, C.; Preveaux, A.; Briand, M.; Poisson, A.-S.; Sarniguet, A.; Barret, M.; Simonin, M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568582\nSynthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Pest insects and microbial pathogens threaten agricultural crop productivity and global forest biomes, and insect-microbe interactions can increase the severity of plant decline. Whilst bacterial chemicals have been shown to influence insect behaviour, the impact of insect-derived chemistries on phytopathogens is barely understood. Here, we investigated beetle larvae-bacteria interactions in acute oak decline (AOD), a decline disease of oak characterised by inner bark necrosis caused by a polymicrobial consortium including Brenneria goodwinii and larval galleries of Agrilus biguttatus. To test the hypothesis that larval chemicals influence the activity of B. goodwinii, we extracted A. biguttatus larvae and tested the effect of extracts on the growth and gene expression of B. goodwinii in vitro. We demonstrate that larval chemicals elicit increased bacterial growth rate and final cell density, as well as differential expression of almost 800 genes, including the Type III Secretion System and its effectors, major virulence factors in other plant pathogens. Contrastingly, gallery woody-tissue extracts induced no such effects. Our work highlights the importance of multi-kingdom interactions in plant disease and demonstrate a novel mode-of-action for insect-derived chemical elicitors in facilitating the virulence of phytopathogens, which may be important in understanding plant diseases globally.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cross-species transmission of pathogens can be facilitated by frequent contact among wildlife. Cross-species transmission is often driven by phylogenetic similarity between host species, but the role this plays when multiple host species co-roost is unknown. We developed a generalizable framework for understanding how cross-species transmission is driven by contact among co-roosting species spanning evolutionary similarities and the net impact on roost-level infection prevalence. We developed ordinary differential equation models describing population and infection dynamics between two and three co-roosting species. We parameterized models using co-roosting Neotropical bat systems, with interspecific transmission exponentially declining with phylogenetic distance. To assess the relative contribution of contact rates and phylogenetic similarity, we co-varied intraspecific transmission rates and phylogenetic distances while considering sensitivity to host and pathogen traits. While our models converged on similar equilibria under high intraspecific transmission or long durations of infection and immunity or latency, simulations with lower intraspecific transmission and shorter such periods revealed roost-level prevalence was greatest when hosts were most closely related. However, we identified regions of parameter space where roost-level prevalence also maximized when hosts were distantly related, driven by species-specific traits. Our generalizable models are adaptable to other co-roosting systems and informs our understanding of pathogen spillover.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Community-wide assembly of plant-pollinator systems depends on an intricate combination of biotic and abiotic factors, including heterogeneity among pollinators in thermal biology and responses to abiotic environmental gradients. Studies on the thermal biology of pollinators, however, have mostly considered only one or a few species of plants or pollinators at a time, and the possible driving role of the diversity in thermal biology of pollinator asemblages at the plant community level thus remains largely unexplored. More specifically, it is unknown whether expected diversity in the thermal biology of bees, a major, species-rich pollinator group worldwide, contributes to the assembly and maintenance of diverse bee communities, broadens the spectrum of possibilities available to bee-pollinated plants, facilitate interspecific partitioning of ecological gradients across habitats, seasons and time of day, and/or enhance plant pollination success through complementarity effects. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity in thermal biology of the bee assemblage pollinating the community of entomophilous plants from a Mediterranean montane area, and to elucidate whether there existed seasonal, daily, between-habitat or floral visitation correlates of bee thermal biology which could contribute to partition ecological gradients among plant and bee species. Thermal biology parameters were obtained in the laboratory (K, intrinsic warming constant) and the field (thoracic and ambient temperature at foraging site, Tth and Tair) on individual bees of a diverse sample (N = 204 bee species) comprising most bee pollinators of the regional plant community. Species-specific thermal biology parameters were combined with quantitative field data on bee pollinators and flower visitation for the regional community of entomophilous plants (N = 292 plant species). Results revealed that the regional bee assemblage harbored considerable diversity in thermal biology features, that such diversity was mostly taxonomically and body-size structured, and that the broad interspecific heterogeneity in thermal biology represented in the bee community as a whole eventually translated into daily, seasonal, among-habitat and flower visitation patterns at the plant community level. This lends support to the hypothesis that broad diversity in thermal biology of bees can act enhancing opportunities for bee coexistence, spatio-temporal partitioning of floral resources, and plant pollination success.

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe recently discovered Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) fungus can cause high mortality rates in some European salamanders and newts (urodelans) and has the potential to expand its currently small invasive range in Europe. Therefore, monitoring its distribution and better understanding both the species threatened and the mechanics of infection are essential in mitigating the damage Bsal may cause. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for detecting both this fungal pathogen and the amphibian communities in infected areas. We applied these methods in the province Gelderland, the Netherlands where the pathogen has previously been detected and is expanding its range, with the goal of detecting the natural amphibian community present. We sampled 27 water bodies in the region surrounding the known outbreak sites. We used data from a Bsal-specific qPCR assay to determine its presence-absence and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the amphibian communities using two different primer sets. The 12S vertebrate primer set outperformed the 16S amphibian primer set and detected all the expected amphibians in the study area: Bufo bufo, Lissotriton vulgaris, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax spp., Rana temporaria and Triturus cristatus. Bsal was detected at eight of the ponds. A distance-based redundancy analysis found a weak but significant relationship between Bsal presence and the composition of amphibian communities using eDNA. This study provides the foundation for future studies on Bsal and its relationship with amphibian communities in Europe, highlighting the need for further research into the mechanisms of persistence and transmission between water bodies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protists (microeukaryotes) are key contributors to marine carbon cycling, influencing the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels and the vertical movement of carbon to the ocean interior. Their physiology, ecology, and interactions with the chemical environment are still poorly understood in offshore ecosystems, and especially in the deep ocean. Using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Clio, the microbial community along a 1,050 km transect in the western North Atlantic Ocean was surveyed at 10-200 m vertical depth increments to capture metabolic microeukaryote signatures spanning a gradient of oligotrophic, continental margin, and productive coastal ecosystems. Plankton biomass was collected along the surface of this transect and across depth features, and taxonomy and metabolic function were examined using a paired metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic approach. A shift in the microeukaryote community composition was observed from the euphotic zone through the mesopelagic and into the bathypelagic ocean. A diverse surface assemblage consisting of haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and ciliates was represented in both the transcript and protein fractions, with foraminifera, radiolaria, picozoa, and discoba proteins enriched at &gt;200 m depth, and fungal proteins emerging in waters &gt;3,000 m depth. In the broad microeukaryote community, nitrogen stress biomarkers were found in productive coastal sites, with phosphorus stress biomarkers in offshore waters where Saharan dust input is thought to supply iron and nitrogen. This multi-omics dataset broadens our understanding of how microeukaryotic taxa and their functional processes are structured along environmental gradients of temperature, light, macronutrients, and trace metals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial metabolism sustains life on Earth. Sequencing surveys of communities in hosts, oceans, and soils have revealed ubiquitous patterns linking the microbes present, the genes they possess, and local environmental conditions. One prominent explanation for these patterns is environmental filtering: local conditions select strains with particular traits. However, filtering assumes ecological interactions do not influence patterns, despite the fact that interactions can and do play an important role in structuring communities. Here, we demonstrate the insufficiency of the environmental filtering hypothesis for explaining global patterns in topsoil microbiomes. Using denitrification as a model system, we find that the abundances of two characteristic genotypes trade-off with pH; nar gene abundances increase while nap abundances decrease with declining pH. Contradicting the filtering hypothesis, we show that strains possessing the Nar genotype are enriched in low pH conditions but fail to grow alone. Instead, the dominance of Nar genotypes at low pH arises from an ecological interaction with Nap genotypes that alleviates nitrite toxicity. Our study provides a roadmap for dissecting how global associations between environmental variables and gene abundances arise from environmentally modulated community interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vector control interventions often lack comprehensive information on vector population distribution and dynamics. This knowledge gap poses challenges in targeting interventions effectively, especially in areas with heterogeneous transmission and where complementary vector control tools may be required to achieve sustained impact on disease transmission. In this study, we implemented a spatially explicit sampling framework for improved vector surveillance in coastal Kenya. Our stratified lattice with close pair sampling design aimed to characterise the vector dynamics of the primary malaria-transmitting species in the area and assess the ecotype classifications effectiveness at identifying clear population patterns. The study collected 3,621 mosquitoes, with An. funestus s.l. being the most abundant malaria vector. The inclusion of the ecotype classification significantly improved spatial abundance model estimates for An. gambiae and Culex spp. Wetlands, topographic wetness index, and proximity to rivers were associated with increased mosquito abundance. Spatial modelling revealed high abundance regions near the Galana-Sabaki River. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a reproducible spatial sampling approach to identify areas with high vector abundance and inform targeted vector control strategies. The study highlights the importance of ecological stratification and a spatial explicit sampling approach for predicting mosquito presence when prior data is limited and underscores the potential for refining future sampling for control efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIChemodiversity, the diversity of specialised metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood.
C_LIO_LIThis study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing so-called chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined.
C_LIO_LIOur findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in one year, suggesting competitive interactions between these two groups. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type.
C_LIO_LISynthesis. Our study emphasizes the significance of the scale at which different chemical profiles are perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the reproductive fitness of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help elucidating the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic Communities (SynComs) are being developed and tested to manipulate plant microbiota and improve plant health. To date, only few studies proposed the use of SynCom on seed despite its potential for plant microbiota engineering. We developed and presented a simple, reproducible and effective seedling microbiota engineering method using SynCom inoculation on seeds. The method was successful using a wide diversity of SynCom compositions and bacterial strains that are representative of the common bean seed microbiota. First, this method enables the modulation of seed microbiota composition and community size. Then, SynComs strongly outcompeted native seed and potting soil microbiota and contributed on average to 80% of the seedling microbiota. We showed that strain abundance on seed was a main driver of an effective seedling microbiota colonization. Also, selection was partly involved in seed and seedling colonization capacities since strains affiliated to Enterobacteriaceae and Erwiniaceae were good colonizers while Bacillaceae and Microbacteriaceae were poor colonizers. Additionally, the engineered seed microbiota modified the recruitment and assembly of seedling and rhizosphere microbiota through priority effects. This study shows that SynCom inoculation on seeds represents a promising approach to study plant microbiota assembly and its consequence on plant fitness.</p>
