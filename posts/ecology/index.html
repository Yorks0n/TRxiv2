C.; Rillig, M.; Sch\nScore: 33.9, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.548516\nAcross the tree of life, organismal functional strategies form a continuum from slow-to fast-growing organisms, in response to common drivers such as resource availability and disturbance. However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for \u003e2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that slow and fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.\nBiogeographic context mediates multifaceted diversity-productivity relationships in island and mainland forests\nAuthors: Tolmos, M. L.; Guerrero-Ramirez, N. R.; Ameztegui, A.; Barajas Barbosa, M. P.; Craven, D.; Kreft, H.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549319\nAimGrowing evidence suggests that impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and natures contributions to people are usually negative, yet the magnitude and direction of these impacts can be variable across naturally-assembled ecosystems. A potential driver of variation in diversity-productivity relationships is the biogeographical context, which may alter these relationships via processes acting on the size and composition of the species pool like dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, speciation, and invasibility. However, the extent to which the relationships between biodiversity facets and forest productivity are shaped by the biogeographic context remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effects of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional tree diversity on aboveground productivity in climatically similar forests on islands and mainland. LocationContinental and insular Spain. Time period1997-2018. Major taxa studiedTrees. MethodsUsing plot data from a national forest inventory, we assessed the influence of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity on aboveground productivity using linear models and structural equation models, while accounting for environmental conditions, non-native species, and the number of trees. ResultsWe find that drier environmental conditions lead to a decrease in productivity and in the number of trees in both island and mainland forests. In island forests, non-native species increased productivity directly and via their effects on phylogenetic diversity. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that multifaceted diversity, by capturing the diversity of evolutionary history, contributes to elucidating diversity-productivity relationships in island forests that could not be detected otherwise by taxonomic diversity alone. By filling empty niches in island forests, we find that non-native species are fundamentally altering ecosystem functioning on islands.\nInferring interactions from microbiome data\nAuthors: Zapien-Campos, R.; Bansept, F.; Traulsen, A.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534939\nParameter inference of high-dimensional data is challenging and microbiome time series data is no exception. Methods aimed at predicting from point estimates exist, but often even fail to recover the true parameters from simulated data. Computational methods to robustly infer and quantify the uncertainty in model parameters are needed. Here, we propose a computational workflow addressing such challenges - allowing us to compare mechanistic models and identify the values and the certainty of inferred parameters. This approach allows us to infer which kind of interactions occur in the microbial community. In contrast to point-estimate inference, the distribution for the parameters, our outcome, reflects their uncertainty. To achieve this, we consider as many equations for the statistical moments of the microbiome as parameters. Our inference workflow, which builds upon a mechanistic foundation of microscopic processes, can take into account that commonly metagenomic datasets only provide information on relative abundances and hosts ensembles. With our framework, we move from qualitative prediction to quantifying the likelihood of certain interaction types in microbiomes.\nTar patties are hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover and nitrogen fixation during a nearshore pollution event in the oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea\nAuthors: Rubin-Blum, M.; Yudkovsky, Y.; Marmen, S.; Raveh, O.; Amrani, A.; Kutuzov, I.; Guy-Haim, T.; Rahav, E.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.546273\nWeathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.

This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asias largest livestock wet market, located next to the continents largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012. C_LIO_LIDaily processing of \u003e100,000 poultry-fowls at Ghazipur results in an annual production of [~]27,375 metric tonnes of poultry-waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately \u003e33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter-remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. Absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. This raises vital questions about microclimate impacts by green house gases (GHG) released from massive amounts of routine detritus. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste. C_LIO_LIPublic health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic-lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains. C_LIO_LIWaste-biomass driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food-waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats. C_LI Lay SummaryO_LIThe global trend of increasing consumption of broiler chickens, driven by rising incomes in tropical cities, has significant ecological implications for both native and migratory birds, as well as other commensal species. C_LIO_LIThe resulting large amounts of debris produced by poultry production and consumption have created a \"chicken reconfigured biosphere\" in cities along migratory paths. C_LIO_LITo better understand the local and global impacts of poultry production and consumption chains, I conducted a long-term study at Asias largest livestock wet market in Ghazipur, Delhi. C_LIO_LIThe findings reveal that informal handling of poultry waste and cultural practices have had significant impacts on animals that scavenge on the slaughter remains, particularly during the bird flu and COVID-19 pandemics. C_LIO_LIThe study recommends ways to minimise conflicts and health risks and reduce the potential impacts of rotting garbage on the climate by accommodating animals that have adapted to shared urban environments.

G.; Storch, D.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549376\nLarge-scale temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns have traditionally been explained by multitudinous particular factors and a few theories. However, these theories lack sufficient generality and problematically do not address fundamental interrelationships and coupled dynamics between resource availability, community abundance, and species richness. We propose the equilibrium theory of biodiversity dynamics (ETBD) to address these linkages, including the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship and phenomena such as niche complementarity, facilitation, and ecosystem engineering. It shows how tipping points and alternative stable states in both diversity and community abundance emerge from nonlinear BEF relationships and the dependence of origination and extinction on population size. ETBD predicts how the strength of the BEF affects scaling relationships between species richness and (meta)community abundance along different environmental gradients. Using data on global-scale variation in tree species richness, we show how the general framework is useful for clarifying the role of speciation, extinction, resource availability, and temperature in driving biodiversity patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient.

M.; Matias, M. A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549293\nPierces Disease (PD) is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which poses a significant threat to grapevines worldwide. Despite its importance, the risk of future PD establishment in Europe remains unclear due to previous incomplete methodologies followed by conflicting results. Here we present a comprehensive approach considering the compound effect of climate change on the pathosystem. Within the general trend of progressively increasing PD risk, we identified the +3{o}C scenario as a turning point for potential spreading beyond Mediterranean regions, representing a serious risk for French and Italian viticulture. Our innovative methodology reveals PD risk as a multi-factor multi-scale process, showing contrasting spatial patterns and different risk velocities across regions, as well as a high timing uncertainty. By overcoming previous limitations, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential spread of PD in Europe, supporting informed decision-making for disease management and prevention.\nThe Lion's Share: Implications of carnivore diet on endangered herbivores in Tsavo\nAuthors: King, E.; Chakrabarti, S.; Lala, F.; Nyaga, S.; Waiguchu, G.; Chiyo, P. I.; Kimaile, J.; Moller, R.; Omondi, P.; Morris, A.; Bump, J.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.08.548222\nPredation by mammalian carnivores can have cascading, regulatory effects across ecological communities. An understanding of predator diet can therefore provide crucial information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected between 2019 and 2023, coupled with estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized lion prey-consumption and preference in Tsavo, Kenya. A lion-specific biomass model applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that more than 85% of lion diet consisted of large ungulates weighing over 150 kg. While large ungulates were also preferred prey items in terms of their availability, we found a disproportionately high consumption and preference of lions for the endangered hirola and Grevys zebra-- species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex-situ conservation programs. Hirola and Grevys zebra populations have historically remained small in Tsavo despite strong recovery efforts, and our results likely indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on these small but crucial populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap hirola and Grevys zebra within a predator-pit. Our findings have strong implications for understanding lion diet, optimal foraging, and the potential effects predators have on endangered prey species in a landscape of critical conservation importance.\nSystematics of harvester ants (Messor) in Israel based on integrated morphological, genetic, and ecological data\nAuthors: Saar, M.; Eyer, P. A.; Magory Cohen, T.; Ionescu-Hirsch, A.; Dor, R.; Dorchin, N.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549226\nHarvester ants of the genus Messor are considered ecosystem engineers, whose distribution is broadly influenced by a variety of environmental factors. Although distinct Messor species have been reported to inhabit different habitats, their taxonomy in Israel remains largely ambiguous, hampering the proper ecological characterization of these species. Here, we applied an integrative species delimitation approach combining morphology-based identification, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and ecological niche modelling to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among Messor species in the small but ecologically diverse region of Israel. Our analyses of mitochondrial genes revealed the presence of at least 13 well-defined lineages, whereas only seven were supported by the analysis of the nuclear genes. However, the concatenated tree that included all the three markers supported 11 lineages. Among two of the lineages-in M. semirufus and in a group of ants closest in resemblance to M. grandinidus- we identified 3-4 clades that were well established on most trees, inviting further study. In addition, we reveal three undescribed species and raise two subspecies to species rank, highlighting the high diversity of harvester ants in Israel. Ecological niche modelling consistently supported the observed distribution of species, with soil type and average annual temperature being the most influential factors. These results demonstrate that species distribution modelling can serve as a valuable component of integrative species delimitation. We call for future studies to investigate these fascinating lineages of one of the most prominent and ecologically important genera of ants in the Mediterranean Basin.\nProspects and pitfalls of an intrusive model for the Chatelperronian stone tool industry during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in France and northern Spain\nAuthors: Djakovic, I.; Soressi, M.; Roussel, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549013\nThe Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in France and northern Spain reflects the transition from Neandertals to Homo sapiens and the emergence of novel cultural entities and standardised laminar technologies between ~50 and 40 thousand years ago. The Chatelperronian stone tool industry sits at the centre of this period, and is commonly considered as representing a geographically isolated archaeological entity produced by late Neandertals. However, debate as to the makers and origin of this industry has long persisted. Fuel has recently been thrown onto this discussion through the formulation of a hypothesis in which the Chatelperronian directly originates from the Northern Early Ahmarian industry of the Levant. This model proposes that the Chatelperronian is in fact indicative of a direct migration of a population of Homo sapiens from the Levant to France around 44-40 thousand years ago - potentially via the crossing (or series of crossings) of the Mediterranean Sea. Such a scenario would have significant implications for how we interpret this key portion of recent human evolutionary history. In this paper, we highlight some of the prospects and pitfalls of an intrusive origin model for the emergence of the Chatelperronian industry in western Europe - taking into account technological, chronological, geographic, and stratigraphic perspectives. To frame this discussion, we review the state of understanding on the Chatelperronian and provide a detailed, synthetic review of Chatelperronian lithic technology. Our review reinforces the distinctive and fully Upper Palaeolithic character of this industry, and we subsequently suggest a few avenues of research which, in our opinion, may help shed progressively clearer light on the demographic and cultural processes operating during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in western Europe.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Across the tree of life, organismal functional strategies form a continuum from slow-to fast-growing organisms, in response to common drivers such as resource availability and disturbance. However, the synchronization of these strategies at the entire community level is untested. We combine trait data for &gt;2800 above-and belowground taxa from 14 trophic guilds spanning a disturbance and resource availability gradient in German grasslands. Most guilds consistently respond to these drivers through both direct and trophically-mediated effects, resulting in a  slow-fast axis at the level of the entire community. Fast trait communities were also associated with faster rates of whole ecosystem functioning. These findings demonstrate that  slow and  fast strategies can be manifested at the level of whole ecosystems, opening new avenues of ecosystem-level functional classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimGrowing evidence suggests that impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and natures contributions to people are usually negative, yet the magnitude and direction of these impacts can be variable across naturally-assembled ecosystems. A potential driver of variation in diversity-productivity relationships is the biogeographical context, which may alter these relationships via processes acting on the size and composition of the species pool like dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, speciation, and invasibility. However, the extent to which the relationships between biodiversity facets and forest productivity are shaped by the biogeographic context remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effects of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional tree diversity on aboveground productivity in climatically similar forests on islands and mainland.

LocationContinental and insular Spain.

Time period1997-2018.

Major taxa studiedTrees.

MethodsUsing plot data from a national forest inventory, we assessed the influence of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity on aboveground productivity using linear models and structural equation models, while accounting for environmental conditions, non-native species, and the number of trees.

ResultsWe find that drier environmental conditions lead to a decrease in productivity and in the number of trees in both island and mainland forests. In island forests, non-native species increased productivity directly and via their effects on phylogenetic diversity.

Main conclusionsOur results suggest that multifaceted diversity, by capturing the diversity of evolutionary history, contributes to elucidating diversity-productivity relationships in island forests that could not be detected otherwise by taxonomic diversity alone. By filling empty niches in island forests, we find that non-native species are fundamentally altering ecosystem functioning on islands.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parameter inference of high-dimensional data is challenging and microbiome time series data is no exception. Methods aimed at predicting from point estimates exist, but often even fail to recover the true parameters from simulated data. Computational methods to robustly infer and quantify the uncertainty in model parameters are needed. Here, we propose a computational workflow addressing such challenges - allowing us to compare mechanistic models and identify the values and the certainty of inferred parameters. This approach allows us to infer which kind of interactions occur in the microbial community. In contrast to point-estimate inference, the distribution for the parameters, our outcome, reflects their uncertainty. To achieve this, we consider as many equations for the statistical moments of the microbiome as parameters. Our inference workflow, which builds upon a mechanistic foundation of microscopic processes, can take into account that commonly metagenomic datasets only provide information on relative abundances and hosts ensembles. With our framework, we move from qualitative prediction to quantifying the likelihood of certain interaction types in microbiomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Weathered oil, that is, tar, forms hotspots of hydrocarbon degradation by complex biota in marine environment. Here, we used marker gene sequencing and metagenomics to characterize the communities of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes that colonized tar patties and control samples (wood, plastic), collected in the littoral following an offshore spill in the warm, oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS). We show aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon catabolism niches on tar interior and exterior, linking carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Alongside aromatics and larger alkanes, short-chain alkanes appear to fuel dominant populations, both the aerobic clade UBA5335 (Macondimonas), anaerobic Syntropharchaeales, and facultative Mycobacteriales. Most key organisms, including the hydrocarbon degraders and cyanobacteria, have the potential to fix dinitrogen, potentially alleviating the nitrogen limitation of hydrocarbon degradation in the SEMS. We highlight the complexity of these tar-associated communities, where bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes co-exist, exchanging metabolites and competing for resources and space.

        <p class="abstract">O_LIThe dramatic increase in poultry production and consumption (PPC) over the past decades has raised questions about its impacts on biodiversity, particularly in the Global South. This study focuses on the ecological and environmental impacts of PPC waste metabolism at Asias largest livestock wet market, located next to the continents largest landfill of Ghazipur in Delhi, which I have been monitoring since 2012.
C_LIO_LIDaily processing of &gt;100,000 poultry-fowls at Ghazipur results in an annual production of [~]27,375 metric tonnes of poultry-waste, attracting massive flocks of Black-eared kites, migratory facultative scavengers that winter in South Asia. Approximately &gt;33,600 kites foraged in the area every day and disposed 8.83% of the total PPC slaughter-remains produced during October-April. However, with their return migration to Central Asia, kite flocks over Ghazipur reduced by 90%, leading to a proportional decrease in scavenging services. Absence of kites from the larger, migratory race during May-September did not elicit any compensatory response from the small Indian kite, whose numbers over landfill remained unchanged. This raises vital questions about microclimate impacts by green house gases (GHG) released from massive amounts of routine detritus. Bearing in mind the prevalence of ritual feeding of meat chunks to kites in Delhi, my research indicates how life-history traits (migratory vs. resident) enable exploitation of specific anthropogenic resources, creating distinct kite-niche(s). Other opportunistic scavengers, e.g., dogs, rats, cattle-egrets, several passerines, and livestock (fishes and pigs) also benefited from PPC waste.
C_LIO_LIPublic health and ethical concerns, including Avian-influenza outbreaks in 2018-21 and pandemic-lockdowns from 2020-22 - that affected informal meat processing - reduced the flocking of kites at Ghazipur by altering spatial dispersion of PPC remains.
C_LIO_LIWaste-biomass driven cross-species associations can exacerbate zoonotic threats by putting humans and animals in close contact. The ecological impacts of waste-based biomass, as well as the aerospace conflicts caused by avian scavengers that cause birdstrikes must factor in the integrated management of city waste. The quantity, type, dispersion, and accessibility of food-waste for opportunistic urban fauna in tropical cities along avian migratory pathways are crucial for public health, and for conservation of (facultative) migratory avian-scavengers like Eurasian Griffons and Steppe Eagles that are facing extinction threats.
C_LI

Lay SummaryO_LIThe global trend of increasing consumption of broiler chickens, driven by rising incomes in tropical cities, has significant ecological implications for both native and migratory birds, as well as other commensal species.
C_LIO_LIThe resulting large amounts of debris produced by poultry production and consumption have created a &#34;chicken reconfigured biosphere&#34; in cities along migratory paths.
C_LIO_LITo better understand the local and global impacts of poultry production and consumption chains, I conducted a long-term study at Asias largest livestock wet market in Ghazipur, Delhi.
C_LIO_LIThe findings reveal that informal handling of poultry waste and cultural practices have had significant impacts on animals that scavenge on the slaughter remains, particularly during the bird flu and COVID-19 pandemics.
C_LIO_LIThe study recommends ways to minimise conflicts and health risks and reduce the potential impacts of rotting garbage on the climate by accommodating animals that have adapted to shared urban environments.

        <p class="abstract">Large-scale temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns have traditionally been explained by multitudinous particular factors and a few theories. However, these theories lack sufficient generality and problematically do not address fundamental interrelationships and coupled dynamics between resource availability, community abundance, and species richness. We propose the equilibrium theory of biodiversity dynamics (ETBD) to address these linkages, including the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship and phenomena such as niche complementarity, facilitation, and ecosystem engineering. It shows how tipping points and alternative stable states in both diversity and community abundance emerge from nonlinear BEF relationships and the dependence of origination and extinction on population size. ETBD predicts how the strength of the BEF affects scaling relationships between species richness and (meta)community abundance along different environmental gradients. Using data on global-scale variation in tree species richness, we show how the general framework is useful for clarifying the role of speciation, extinction, resource availability, and temperature in driving biodiversity patterns such as the latitudinal diversity gradient.

        <p class="abstract">Pierces Disease (PD) is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which poses a significant threat to grapevines worldwide. Despite its importance, the risk of future PD establishment in Europe remains unclear due to previous incomplete methodologies followed by conflicting results. Here we present a comprehensive approach considering the compound effect of climate change on the pathosystem. Within the general trend of progressively increasing PD risk, we identified the &#43;3{o}C scenario as a turning point for potential spreading beyond Mediterranean regions, representing a serious risk for French and Italian viticulture. Our innovative methodology reveals PD risk as a multi-factor multi-scale process, showing contrasting spatial patterns and different risk velocities across regions, as well as a high timing uncertainty. By overcoming previous limitations, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential spread of PD in Europe, supporting informed decision-making for disease management and prevention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predation by mammalian carnivores can have cascading, regulatory effects across ecological communities. An understanding of predator diet can therefore provide crucial information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected between 2019 and 2023, coupled with estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized lion prey-consumption and preference in Tsavo, Kenya. A lion-specific biomass model applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that more than 85% of lion diet consisted of large ungulates weighing over 150 kg. While large ungulates were also preferred prey items in terms of their availability, we found a disproportionately high consumption and preference of lions for the endangered hirola and Grevys zebra-- species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex-situ conservation programs. Hirola and Grevys zebra populations have historically remained small in Tsavo despite strong recovery efforts, and our results likely indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on these small but crucial populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap hirola and Grevys zebra within a predator-pit. Our findings have strong implications for understanding lion diet, optimal foraging, and the potential effects predators have on endangered prey species in a landscape of critical conservation importance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Harvester ants of the genus Messor are considered ecosystem engineers, whose distribution is broadly influenced by a variety of environmental factors. Although distinct Messor species have been reported to inhabit different habitats, their taxonomy in Israel remains largely ambiguous, hampering the proper ecological characterization of these species. Here, we applied an integrative species delimitation approach combining morphology-based identification, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and ecological niche modelling to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among Messor species in the small but ecologically diverse region of Israel. Our analyses of mitochondrial genes revealed the presence of at least 13 well-defined lineages, whereas only seven were supported by the analysis of the nuclear genes. However, the concatenated tree that included all the three markers supported 11 lineages. Among two of the lineages-in M. semirufus and in a group of ants closest in resemblance to M. grandinidus- we identified 3-4 clades that were well established on most trees, inviting further study. In addition, we reveal three undescribed species and raise two subspecies to species rank, highlighting the high diversity of harvester ants in Israel. Ecological niche modelling consistently supported the observed distribution of species, with soil type and average annual temperature being the most influential factors. These results demonstrate that species distribution modelling can serve as a valuable component of integrative species delimitation. We call for future studies to investigate these fascinating lineages of one of the most prominent and ecologically important genera of ants in the Mediterranean Basin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in France and northern Spain reflects the transition from Neandertals to Homo sapiens and the emergence of novel cultural entities and standardised laminar technologies between ~50 and 40 thousand years ago. The Chatelperronian stone tool industry sits at the centre of this period, and is commonly considered as representing a geographically isolated archaeological entity produced by late Neandertals. However, debate as to the makers and origin of this industry has long persisted. Fuel has recently been thrown onto this discussion through the formulation of a hypothesis in which the Chatelperronian directly originates from the Northern Early Ahmarian industry of the Levant. This model proposes that the Chatelperronian is in fact indicative of a direct migration of a population of Homo sapiens from the Levant to France around 44-40 thousand years ago - potentially via the crossing (or series of crossings) of the Mediterranean Sea. Such a scenario would have significant implications for how we interpret this key portion of recent human evolutionary history. In this paper, we highlight some of the prospects and pitfalls of an intrusive origin model for the emergence of the Chatelperronian industry in western Europe - taking into account technological, chronological, geographic, and stratigraphic perspectives. To frame this discussion, we review the state of understanding on the Chatelperronian and provide a detailed, synthetic review of Chatelperronian lithic technology. Our review reinforces the distinctive and fully  Upper Palaeolithic character of this industry, and we subsequently suggest a few avenues of research which, in our opinion, may help shed progressively clearer light on the demographic and cultural processes operating during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in western Europe.</p>
