We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.\nHost plant odour and sex pheromone are integral to mate finding in codling moth\nAuthors: Erdei, A.; Preti, M.; Bengtsson, M.; Witzgall, P.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560528\nBehaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.\nSentinels for future coral reef conditions: assessment of environmental variability and water quality in semi-enclosed inland bays in the southern Caribbean\nAuthors: de Jong, C.; van Os, I.; Sepulveda-Rodriguez, G.; de Baat, M. L.; Schoepf, V.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560694\nThe mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and \u003e20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Cura\u0026ccedilao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Cura\u0026ccedilao's inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.\nUnveiling the ecology, taxonomy and metabolic capabilities of MBA03, a potential key player in anaerobic digestion\nAuthors: Puchol-Royo, R.; Pascual, J.; Ortega-Legarreta, A.; Otto, P.; Tideman, J.; de Vries, S.-J.; Abendroth, C.; Tanner, K.; Porcar, M.; Latorre-Perez, A.\nScore: 96.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556800\nBiogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.\nPocillopora meandrina daytime broadcast spawning in Moorea, French Polynesia\nAuthors: Harnay, P.; Putnam, H. M.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.558016\nPocillopora are abundant branching corals that create 3-dimensional reef structure. In French Polynesia, when corals were decimated by crown-of-thorns, bleaching, and a cyclone between 2007-2010, Pocillopora recruitment primarily drove recovery by 2016, yet spawning times are undocumented. To address this, we surveyed Pocillopora in Moorea between September 2022-January 2023. We documented split-spawning around the full moons, with one colony spawning November 10th (06:32, full moon+3days) and reef-wide spawning December 9th (06:16-06:32; full moon+2days) and December 10th (06:21-06:35; full moon+3days). Molecular analysis (n=16) identified 100% as P. meandrina, with 13 as Haplotype 1a and 3 as Haplotype 8a, suggesting P. verrucosa, P. grandis, and Haplotype 10 spawn on the new moon or in later months. These observations provide initial documentation of Pocillopora spawning in Moorea (to our knowledge), expanding on indigenous knowledge and increasing capacity to study Pocillopora reproduction, connectivity, and adaptation.\nConsequences of directly- and indirectly-experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment\nAuthors: Feugere, L.; Silva de Freitas, C.; Bates, A.; Storey, K. B.; Beltran-Alvarez, P.; Valero, K. C. W.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560724\nClimate change increases the frequency and duration of heat events. Negative effects of heat stress may be exacerbated through the action of social metabolites between aquatic animals. Whilst early life stages are vulnerable to stress-induced damage, they deploy cellular mechanisms to protect cells against mutagens such as ultraviolet rays (UV). Little is known about the fate of fish embryos which have experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment. The present study exposed zebrafish embryos to one of three stress history treatments consisting of direct heat stress (TS+UV), the social context of heat stress via social metabolites (SM+UV), and their combination in TS+SM+UV before a UVB/UVA damage/repair assay. We measured phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to these treatments, and estimated mutational damage through DNA mutation frequencies and RNA integrity values. Compared to UV-treated controls (C+UV), the social context of heat stress history preceding the UV assay altered keratin and cell structuring-related pathways, associated with longer embryos with over-developed pericardia displaying behavioural hypoactivity. Relative to C+UV, direct heat stress history preceding UV exposure had a hormetic effect by stimulating the cellular stress response and facilitating DNA repair, which rescued embryos from subsequent UV damage and improved their apparent fitness. However, heat stress combined with social metabolites overwhelmed embryos in the UV assay, which annihilated the hormetic effect, introduced mutations, and lowered their apparent fitness. Whilst generated in the laboratory, these findings provide an important baseline for understanding the consequences of heat stress history in natural environments, where heat stress occurs within a social context.\nEcology and not phylogeny influences sensitivity to climate change in Muscicapidae Flycatchers in Eastern Himalayan and Indo-Burman hotspots\nAuthors: Dhanda, A.; Jezierski, M. T.; Coulson, T.; Clegg, S.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561030\nAims: Species' distributional responses to climate change can depend on ecology and phylogeny. The degree of habitat specialism is potentially important because habitat generalists with wider distributions are assumed to be less sensitive to environmental changes compared to narrowly-distributed habitat specialists. Additionally, predicting which aspects of the changing climate impacts species with different habitat associations may be particularly challenging in complex environments such as those of tropical mountains. We explore the effects of climate change on potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers in parts of the Eastern Himalayan Mountains and the Indo-Burman range, and relate predictions to the level of ecological habitat specialism, while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Location: Bhutan and Northeast India. Methods: We used Maxent to develop ecological niche models of 60 Muscicapidae Flycatchers under different climatic scenarios by collating presences from Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, and elevation from ASTER. Species were scored as habitat specialists or generalists using the Species Specialism Index. Variables with high contributions to Maxent models were extracted to explore sensitivity to climate change based on habitat specialism while testing for phylogenetic signal using Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares. Results: Maxent models had the highest contributions from variable bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter) under present climate, and tmax (maximum temperature) under future climatic scenarios. Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares revealed that habitat generalists had higher sensitivity to climate change than specialists. We did not detect strong phylogenetic signal in sensitivity to abiotic variables under all climate scenarios. Main conclusions: Potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers were sensitive to temperature variable in the month of the highest precipitation, and to maximum temperature. Potential distributions of habitat generalists were particularly sensitive to these abiotic variables, and those of habitat specialists less so. Sensitivity to abiotic variables did not show a pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism.\nEvaluating the definition and distribution of spring ephemeral wildflowers in eastern North America\nAuthors: Yancy, A. J.; Lee, B. R.; Kuebbing, S. E.; Neufeld, H. S.; Spicer, M. E.; Heberling, J. M.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560873\nThe herbaceous layer accounts for the majority of plant biodiversity in eastern North American forests, encompassing substantial variation in life history strategy and function. One group of early season herbaceous understory species, colloquially referred to as \"spring ephemeral wildflowers\", are of particular ecological and cultural importance. Despite this, little is known about the prevalence and biogeographic patterns of the spring ephemeral strategy. Here, we used georeferenced and dated observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to define the phenological strategies of 559 herbaceous, vascular, understory plant species in eastern North America from a composite species list encompassing 16 site-level species lists ranging from Georgia to southern Canada. Specifically, we estimated activity periods from regional observations (primarily consisting of citizen scientist iNaturalist observations) and classified species as ephemeral if they completed all aboveground activity (including leafing, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) prior to an estimated date of canopy closure derived from remote-sensed data. We then evaluated the richness of these species at the landscape scale using estimates of biogeographic and environmental drivers aggregated for 100 km x 100 km grid cells. Importantly, our spatially-explicit approach defines each species' spring ephemerality along a continuous scale (which we call the Ephemerality Index, EI) based on the proportion of its range in which it senesces before canopy closure (with EI = 0 indicating a species that is never ephemeral and EI = 1 indicating a species that is always ephemeral). We found that 18.4% (103 species) of understory wildflowers exhibited spring ephemerality in at least part of their range, with only 3.4% of all species exhibiting ephemeral behavior in all parts of their range. Ephemeral species had higher overall richness and composed a higher proportion of understory biodiversity in low-elevation areas with intermediate spring temperatures and elevated spring precipitation. Spring ephemerals peaked in both absolute species richness and relative proportion at mid latitudes. These biogeographic patterns deserve further study in other regions of the world and to uncover mechanisms behind these patterns. Using our new metric, our results demonstrate that the spring ephemeral strategy is not a discrete category, but rather a continuum that can vary across species' ranges.\nEcological metabolomics of tropical tree communities across an elevational gradient: Implications for chemically-mediated biotic interactions and species diversity\nAuthors: Henderson, D.; Sedio, B. E.; Tello, J. S.; Cayola, L.; Fuentes, A. F.; Alvestegui, B.; Muchhala, N.; Myers, J. A.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560880\nSeminal hypotheses in ecology and evolution postulate that stronger and more specialized biotic interactions contribute to higher species diversity at lower elevations and latitudes. Plant-chemical defenses mediate biotic interactions between plants and their natural enemies and provide a highly dimensional trait space in which chemically mediated niches may facilitate plant species coexistence. However, the role of chemically mediated biotic interactions in shaping plant communities remains largely untested across large-scale ecological gradients. To test this hypothesis, we used ecological metabolomics to quantify the chemical dissimilarity of foliar metabolomes among 473 tree species (906 unique species-plot combinations) in 16 tropical tree communities along an elevational gradient in Madidi National Park, Bolivia. We predicted that chemical dissimilarity among co-occurring tree species would be greater, and chemical phylogenetic signal lower, in communities with greater tree species richness and warmer, wetter, and less-seasonal climates, as pressure from natural enemies is likely to be greater in these locales. Further, we predicted that these relationships should be especially pronounced for secondary metabolites derived from biosynthetic pathways known to include anti-herbivore and antimicrobial defenses than for primary metabolites. We found that median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to all metabolites and secondary metabolites increased with tree species richness, decreased with elevation, and increased along a principal component of climatic variation that reflected increasing temperature and precipitation and decreasing seasonality. In contrast, median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to primary metabolites was unrelated to tree species richness, elevation, or the principal component of climatic variation. Furthermore, phylogenetic signal of secondary and primary metabolites decreased with tree species richness. Among tree communities in moist forests, phylogenetic signal of secondary metabolites also increased with elevation and decreased with the temperature and precipitation. Our results support the hypothesis that chemically mediated biotic interactions shape elevational diversity gradients by imposing stronger selection for interspecific divergence in plant chemical defenses in warmer, wetter, and more stable climates. Our study also illustrates the promise of ecological metabolomics in the study of biogeography, community ecology, and complex species interactions in high-diversity ecosystems.\nPopulation-specific responses to developmental temperature in the arboviral vector : implications for climate change\nAuthors: Carlassara, M.; Khorramnejad, A.; Oker, H.; Bahrami, R.; Lozada-Chavez, A. N.; Mancini, M. V.; Body, M. J.; Lahondere, C.; Bonizzoni, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561151\nThe increase of environmental temperature due to current global warming is not only favorings the expansion of the distribution range of many insect species, but it is also changing their phenology. Insect phenology is tightly linked to developmental timing, which is regulated by environmental temperatures. However, the degree to which effects of developmental temperatures extend across developmental stages and their inter-stage relationships have not been thoroughly quantified in mosquitoes. Here, we used the mosquito , which is an aggressive invasive species and an arboviral vector to study how developmental temperature influences fitness across developmental stages, thermal traits, energy reserves, transcriptome, and prevalence in populations from either temperate or tropical regions. We show that hatchability, larval and pupal viability, and developmental speed are strongly influenced by temperature and these effects extend to wing length, body mass, longevity, content of water, protein and lipids in adults, in a population-specific manner. On the contrary, neither adult thermal preference nor heat resistance significantly change with temperature. Development at 18{degrees}C revealed to be a limiting factor for the proliferation of in adults and transcriptome analysis showed enrichment for functions linked to stress responses (i.e. cuticle proteins and chitin, cytochrome p450, and heat shock proteins) in mosquitoes reared at both 18{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C. Our data showed an overall reduced vector fitness performance when mosquitoes were reared at 32{degrees}C, and the absence of isomorphy in the relationship between developmental stages and temperature in the temperate population. Altogether these results have important implications for reliable model projections of the invasion potentials of and its epidemiological impact.\n",

        <p class="abstract">With agricultural demands increasing globally, determining the nature of impacts of different forms of agriculture on biodiversity, especially for threatened vertebrates and habitats, is critical to inform land management. We determined the impacts of converting rock outcrops (a habitat more threatened than rainforests) to orchards and paddy on anurans in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 50 belt transects four times across four sites during the rainy season and recorded information on amphibians and their microhabitats. We determined community-level responses using Hill numbers, beta-diversity measures, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and species-level responses using joint species distribution modelling. Converting rock outcrops to paddy and orchards significantly altered microhabitat availability. Conversion to paddy mostly had community-level impacts, i.e., lowered species richness and more nested communities, whereas conversion to orchards mostly had species-level impacts, i.e., lowered species occurrence, highlighting the differential impacts of different forms of agriculture on amphibians and the need to determine impacts of land-use change on communities and species concurrently. We show that large rock pools are critical microhabitats for anurans as they serve as a refuge and protect anurans from desiccation during dry spells, which may be prolonged by climate change. Since rock outcrop habitats in low elevations are rapidly being converted to orchards, efforts are needed to conserve them in partnership with local communities, the custodians of these habitats. Our findings demonstrate that different forms of agriculture can have divergent impacts on biodiversity, and determining their impacts may require assessments at multiple scales, from species to communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Behaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum is of immense ecological and socio-economic importance, supporting biodiversity, carbon storage, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. The presence of extreme environmental conditions along this continuum could support adaptive refugia for climate-sensitive taxa such as reef-building corals but physicochemical conditions are rarely assessed at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, coastal development and low water quality increasingly threaten these interconnected coastal ecosystems. Yet, time-integrated pollution monitoring is absent at most locations. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to assess benthic cover, coral diversity, and &gt;20 abiotic parameters characterizing two mangrove- and seagrass-dominated inland bays and two nearby coral reefs in Cura&amp;ccedilao (southern Caribbean) during the cool, dry season and warm, wet season. This was combined with time-integrated pollution monitoring using bioindicators to assess nutrients and trace metal pollution (inland bays only), and passive samplers and bioassays to assess organic chemical pollution (all four sites) during the wet season. This approach revealed a previously undocumented extent of strong diel and seasonal environmental variability in the two inland bays, with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen frequently reaching values predicted under moderate-to-severe future climate scenarios. In addition, the inland bays had greater nutrient concentrations (especially ammonium) and ecotoxicological risks than the nearby reefs during the wet season due to run-off, industrial- and wastewater effluents, ports and boating. Overall, our findings show that Cura&amp;ccedilao&#39;s inland bays have significant potential to serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of future ocean conditions on resident taxa in situ. This however applies within the context of strong diel fluctuations and with the caveat of co-occurring stressors. Our work confirms the important role of mangrove and seagrass habitats as resilience hotspots for climate-sensitive taxa but also highlights the urgent need to improve monitoring, water quality and protection of these valuable habitats along the mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biogas, a mix of CO2, CH4 and small proportions of other gases, is a biofuel obtained by anaerobic digestion (AD). Biogas production is often considered a black box process, as the role and dynamics of some of the microorganisms involved remain undisclosed. Previous metataxonomic studies in the frame of the MICRO4BIOGAS project (www.micro4biogas.eu) revealed that MBA03, an uncharacterised and uncultured bacterial taxon, was very prevalent and abundant in industrial full-scale AD plants. Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pocillopora are abundant branching corals that create 3-dimensional reef structure. In French Polynesia, when corals were decimated by crown-of-thorns, bleaching, and a cyclone between 2007-2010, Pocillopora recruitment primarily drove recovery by 2016, yet spawning times are undocumented. To address this, we surveyed Pocillopora in Moorea between September 2022-January 2023. We documented split-spawning around the full moons, with one colony spawning November 10th (06:32, full moon&#43;3days) and reef-wide spawning December 9th (06:16-06:32; full moon&#43;2days) and December 10th (06:21-06:35; full moon&#43;3days). Molecular analysis (n=16) identified 100% as P. meandrina, with 13 as Haplotype 1a and 3 as Haplotype 8a, suggesting P. verrucosa, P. grandis, and Haplotype 10 spawn on the new moon or in later months. These observations provide initial documentation of Pocillopora spawning in Moorea (to our knowledge), expanding on indigenous knowledge and increasing capacity to study Pocillopora reproduction, connectivity, and adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Climate change increases the frequency and duration of heat events. Negative effects of heat stress may be exacerbated through the action of social metabolites between aquatic animals. Whilst early life stages are vulnerable to stress-induced damage, they deploy cellular mechanisms to protect cells against mutagens such as ultraviolet rays (UV). Little is known about the fate of fish embryos which have experienced heat stress in a mutagenic environment. The present study exposed zebrafish embryos to one of three stress history treatments consisting of direct heat stress (TS&#43;UV), the social context of heat stress via social metabolites (SM&#43;UV), and their combination in TS&#43;SM&#43;UV before a UVB/UVA damage/repair assay. We measured phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to these treatments, and estimated mutational damage through DNA mutation frequencies and RNA integrity values. Compared to UV-treated controls (C&#43;UV), the social context of heat stress history preceding the UV assay altered keratin and cell structuring-related pathways, associated with longer embryos with over-developed pericardia displaying behavioural hypoactivity. Relative to C&#43;UV, direct heat stress history preceding UV exposure had a hormetic effect by stimulating the cellular stress response and facilitating DNA repair, which rescued embryos from subsequent UV damage and improved their apparent fitness. However, heat stress combined with social metabolites overwhelmed embryos in the UV assay, which annihilated the hormetic effect, introduced mutations, and lowered their apparent fitness. Whilst generated in the laboratory, these findings provide an important baseline for understanding the consequences of heat stress history in natural environments, where heat stress occurs within a social context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aims: Species&#39; distributional responses to climate change can depend on ecology and phylogeny. The degree of habitat specialism is potentially important because habitat generalists with wider distributions are assumed to be less sensitive to environmental changes compared to narrowly-distributed habitat specialists. Additionally, predicting which aspects of the changing climate impacts species with different habitat associations may be particularly challenging in complex environments such as those of tropical mountains. We explore the effects of climate change on potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers in parts of the Eastern Himalayan Mountains and the Indo-Burman range, and relate predictions to the level of ecological habitat specialism, while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Location: Bhutan and Northeast India. Methods: We used Maxent to develop ecological niche models of 60 Muscicapidae Flycatchers under different climatic scenarios by collating presences from Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, and elevation from ASTER. Species were scored as habitat specialists or generalists using the Species Specialism Index. Variables with high contributions to Maxent models were extracted to explore sensitivity to climate change based on habitat specialism while testing for phylogenetic signal using Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares. Results: Maxent models had the highest contributions from variable bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter) under present climate, and tmax (maximum temperature) under future climatic scenarios. Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares revealed that habitat generalists had higher sensitivity to climate change than specialists. We did not detect strong phylogenetic signal in sensitivity to abiotic variables under all climate scenarios. Main conclusions: Potential distributions of Muscicapidae Flycatchers were sensitive to temperature variable in the month of the highest precipitation, and to maximum temperature. Potential distributions of habitat generalists were particularly sensitive to these abiotic variables, and those of habitat specialists less so. Sensitivity to abiotic variables did not show a pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The herbaceous layer accounts for the majority of plant biodiversity in eastern North American forests, encompassing substantial variation in life history strategy and function. One group of early season herbaceous understory species, colloquially referred to as &#34;spring ephemeral wildflowers&#34;, are of particular ecological and cultural importance. Despite this, little is known about the prevalence and biogeographic patterns of the spring ephemeral strategy. Here, we used georeferenced and dated observations from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to define the phenological strategies of 559 herbaceous, vascular, understory plant species in eastern North America from a composite species list encompassing 16 site-level species lists ranging from Georgia to southern Canada. Specifically, we estimated activity periods from regional observations (primarily consisting of citizen scientist iNaturalist observations) and classified species as ephemeral if they completed all aboveground activity (including leafing, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) prior to an estimated date of canopy closure derived from remote-sensed data. We then evaluated the richness of these species at the landscape scale using estimates of biogeographic and environmental drivers aggregated for 100 km x 100 km grid cells. Importantly, our spatially-explicit approach defines each species&#39; spring ephemerality along a continuous scale (which we call the Ephemerality Index, EI) based on the proportion of its range in which it senesces before canopy closure (with EI = 0 indicating a species that is never ephemeral and EI = 1 indicating a species that is always ephemeral). We found that 18.4% (103 species) of understory wildflowers exhibited spring ephemerality in at least part of their range, with only 3.4% of all species exhibiting ephemeral behavior in all parts of their range. Ephemeral species had higher overall richness and composed a higher proportion of understory biodiversity in low-elevation areas with intermediate spring temperatures and elevated spring precipitation. Spring ephemerals peaked in both absolute species richness and relative proportion at mid latitudes. These biogeographic patterns deserve further study in other regions of the world and to uncover mechanisms behind these patterns. Using our new metric, our results demonstrate that the spring ephemeral strategy is not a discrete category, but rather a continuum that can vary across species&#39; ranges.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Seminal hypotheses in ecology and evolution postulate that stronger and more specialized biotic interactions contribute to higher species diversity at lower elevations and latitudes. Plant-chemical defenses mediate biotic interactions between plants and their natural enemies and provide a highly dimensional trait space in which chemically mediated niches may facilitate plant species coexistence. However, the role of chemically mediated biotic interactions in shaping plant communities remains largely untested across large-scale ecological gradients. To test this hypothesis, we used ecological metabolomics to quantify the chemical dissimilarity of foliar metabolomes among 473 tree species (906 unique species-plot combinations) in 16 tropical tree communities along an elevational gradient in Madidi National Park, Bolivia. We predicted that chemical dissimilarity among co-occurring tree species would be greater, and chemical phylogenetic signal lower, in communities with greater tree species richness and warmer, wetter, and less-seasonal climates, as pressure from natural enemies is likely to be greater in these locales. Further, we predicted that these relationships should be especially pronounced for secondary metabolites derived from biosynthetic pathways known to include anti-herbivore and antimicrobial defenses than for primary metabolites. We found that median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to all metabolites and secondary metabolites increased with tree species richness, decreased with elevation, and increased along a principal component of climatic variation that reflected increasing temperature and precipitation and decreasing seasonality. In contrast, median chemical dissimilarity among tree species with respect to primary metabolites was unrelated to tree species richness, elevation, or the principal component of climatic variation. Furthermore, phylogenetic signal of secondary and primary metabolites decreased with tree species richness. Among tree communities in moist forests, phylogenetic signal of secondary metabolites also increased with elevation and decreased with the temperature and precipitation. Our results support the hypothesis that chemically mediated biotic interactions shape elevational diversity gradients by imposing stronger selection for interspecific divergence in plant chemical defenses in warmer, wetter, and more stable climates. Our study also illustrates the promise of ecological metabolomics in the study of biogeography, community ecology, and complex species interactions in high-diversity ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increase of environmental temperature due to current global warming is not only favorings the expansion of the distribution range of many insect species, but it is also changing their phenology. Insect phenology is tightly linked to developmental timing, which is regulated by environmental temperatures. However, the degree to which effects of developmental temperatures extend across developmental stages and their inter-stage relationships have not been thoroughly quantified in mosquitoes. Here, we used the mosquito &lt;Aedes albopictus&gt;, which is an aggressive invasive species and an arboviral vector to study how developmental temperature influences fitness across developmental stages, thermal traits, energy reserves, transcriptome, and &lt;Wolbachia&gt; prevalence in populations from either temperate or tropical regions. We show that hatchability, larval and pupal viability, and developmental speed are strongly influenced by temperature and these effects extend to wing length, body mass, longevity, content of water, protein and lipids in adults, in a population-specific manner. On the contrary, neither adult thermal preference nor heat resistance significantly change with temperature. Development at 18{degrees}C revealed to be a limiting factor for the proliferation of &lt;Wolbachia&gt; in adults and transcriptome analysis showed enrichment for functions linked to stress responses (i.e. cuticle proteins and chitin, cytochrome p450, and heat shock proteins) in mosquitoes reared at both 18{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C. Our data showed an overall reduced vector fitness performance when mosquitoes were reared at 32{degrees}C, and the absence of isomorphy in the relationship between developmental stages and temperature in the temperate population. Altogether these results have important implications for reliable model projections of the invasion potentials of &lt;Ae. albopictus&gt; and its epidemiological impact.</p>
