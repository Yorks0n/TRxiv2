K.; Sha, Z.; Lutje, L.; Kong, X.-Z.; Velthuijs, N.; van Heukelum, S.; van de Berg, W. D. J.; Jonkman, L. E.; Fisher, S. E.; Francks, C.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575815\nThe language network of the human brain has core components in the inferior frontal cortex and superior/middle temporal cortex, with left-hemisphere dominance in most people. Functional specialization and interconnectivity of these neocortical regions is likely to be reflected in their molecular and cellular profiles. Excitatory connections between cortical regions arise and innervate according to layer-specific patterns. Here we generated a new gene expression dataset from human postmortem cortical tissue samples from core language network regions, using spatial transcriptomics to discriminate gene expression across cortical layers. Integration of these data with existing single-cell expression data identified 56 genes that showed differences in laminar expression profiles between frontal and temporal language cortex together with upregulation in layer II/III and/or layer V/VI excitatory neurons. Based on data from large-scale genome-wide screening in the population, DNA variants within these 56 genes showed set-level associations with inter-individual variation in structural connectivity between left-hemisphere frontal and temporal language cortex, and with predisposition to dyslexia. The axon guidance genes SLIT1 and SLIT2 were consistently implicated. These findings identify region-specific patterns of laminar gene expression as a feature of the brain's language network.\nAccurate inference of population history in the presence of background selection\nAuthors: Cousins, T.; Tabin, D.; Patterson, N.; Reich, D.; Durvasula, A.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576291\nAll published methods for learning about demographic history make the simplifying assumption that the genome evolves neutrally, and do not seek to account for the effects of natural selection on patterns of variation. This is a major concern, as ample work has demonstrated the pervasive effects of natural selection and in particular background selection (BGS) on patterns of genetic variation in diverse species. Simulations and theoretical work have shown that methods to infer changes in effective population size over time (N(t)) become increasingly inaccurate as the strength of linked selection increases. Here, we introduce an extension to the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) algorithm, PSMC+, which explicitly co-models demographic history and natural selection. We benchmark our method using forward-in-time simulations with BGS and find that our approach improves the accuracy of effective population size inference. Leveraging a high resolution map of BGS in humans, we infer considerable changes in the magnitude of inferred effective population size relative to previous reports. Finally, we separately infer N(t) on the X chromosome and on the autosomes in diverse great apes without making a correction for selection, and find that the inferred ratio fluctuates substantially through time in a way that differs across species, showing that uncorrected selection may be an important driver of signals of genetic difference on the X chromosome and autosomes.\nDiencephalic and Neuropeptidergic Dysfunction in Zebrafish with Autism Risk Mutations\nAuthors: Capps, M. E. S.; Moyer, A. J.; Conklin, C. L.; Martina, V.; Torija-Olson, E. G.; Klein, M. C.; Gannaway, W. C.; Calhoun, C. C. S.; Vivian, M. D.; Thyme, S. B.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576309\nHundreds of human mutations are linked to autism and related disorders, yet the functions of many of these mutated genes during vertebrate neurodevelopment are unclear. We generated 27 zebrafish mutants with presumptive protein-truncating mutations or specific missense variants corresponding to autism-risk alleles in 17 human genes. We observed baseline and stimulus-driven behavioral changes at larval stages, as well as social behavior differences in lines tested as juveniles. Imaging whole-brain activity revealed a near identical activity map for mutations in the unrelated genes kmt5b and hdlbpa, defined by increased activity mainly in the diencephalon. Mutating 7 of the 17 risk genes resulted in substantial brain size differences. Using RNA sequencing, we further defined molecular drivers of the observed phenotypes, identifying targetable disruptions in neuropeptide signaling, neuronal maturation, and cell proliferation. This multi-modal screen nominated brain regions, cell types, and molecular pathways that may contribute to autism susceptibility.\nGenome scale CRISPR screens identify actin capping proteins as key modulators of therapeutic responses to radiation and immunotherapy\nAuthors: Verma, N.; Renauer, P. A.; Dong, C.; Xin, S.; Lin, Q.; Zhang, F.; Glazer, P. M.; Chen, S.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575614\nRadiotherapy (RT), is a fundamental treatment for malignant tumors and is used in over half of cancer patients. As radiation can promote anti-tumor immune effects, a promising therapeutic strategy is to combine radiation with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, the genetic determinants that impact therapeutic response in the context of combination therapy with radiation and ICI have not been systematically investigated. To unbiasedly identify the tumor intrinsic genetic factors governing such responses, we perform a set of genome-scale CRISPR screens in melanoma cells for cancer survival in response to low-dose genotoxic radiation treatment, in the context of CD8 T cell co-culture and with anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade antibody. Two actin capping proteins, Capza3 and Capg, emerge as top hits that upon inactivation promote the survival of melanoma cells in such settings. Capza3 and Capg knockouts (KOs) in mouse and human cancer cells display persistent DNA damage due to impaired homology directed repair (HDR); along with increased radiation, chemotherapy, and DNA repair inhibitor sensitivity. However, when cancer cells with these genes inactivated were exposed to sublethal radiation, inactivation of such actin capping protein promotes activation of the STING pathway, induction of inhibitory CEACAM1 ligand expression and resistance to CD8 T cell killing. Patient cancer genomics analysis reveals an increased mutational burden in patients with inactivating mutations in CAPG and/or CAPZA3, at levels comparable to other HDR associated genes. There is also a positive correlation between CAPG expression and activation of immune related pathways and CD8 T cell tumor infiltration. Our results unveil the critical roles of actin binding proteins for efficient HDR within cancer cells and demonstrate a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of therapeutic response to radiation and immunotherapy.\nAssociations between common genetic variants and income provide insights about the socioeconomic health gradient\nAuthors: Kweon, H.; Burik, C.

O.; Magnus, P.; Marques-Vidal, P.; M\nScore: 50.7, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574865\nWe conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on income among individuals of European descent and leveraged the results to investigate the socio-economic health gradient (N=668,288). We found 162 genomic loci associated with a common genetic factor underlying various income measures, all with small effect sizes. Our GWAS-derived polygenic index captures 1 - 4% of income variance, with only one-fourth attributed to direct genetic effects. A phenome-wide association study using this polygenic index showed reduced risks for a broad spectrum of diseases, including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary atherosclerosis, depression, asthma, and back pain. The income factor showed a substantial genetic correlation (0.92, s.e. = .006) with educational attainment (EA). Accounting for EAs genetic overlap with income revealed that the remaining genetic signal for higher income related to better mental health but reduced physical health benefits and increased participation in risky behaviours such as drinking and smoking.\nSAM-DNMT3A, a strategy for induction of genome-wide DNA methylation, identifies DNA methylation as a vulnerability in ER-positive breast cancers\nAuthors: Hosseinpour, M.; Malaver-Ortega, L.; Perlaza-Jimenez, L.; Joo, J. E.; Liu, L.; Caldon, C. E.; Dugue, P.-A.; Dowty, J. G.; Southey, M. C.; Rosenbluh, J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575955\nDNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression. DNA methylase (DNMT) inhibitors, inhibit global DNA methylation, and have been a key tool in studies of DNA methylation in healthy or disease conditions. A major bottleneck is the lack of tools to induce global DNA methylation. Here, we engineered a CRISPR based approach, that was initially designed, to enable site specific DNA methylation. Using the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system, we unexpectedly found that regardless of the targeted sequence any sgRNA induced global genome-wide DNA methylation. We termed this new method SAM-DNMT3A and show that induction of global DNA methylation is a unique vulnerability in ER-positive breast cancer suggesting a therapeutic approach. Our findings highlight the need of caution when using CRISPR based approaches for inducing DNA methylation and demonstrate a new method for global induction of DNA methylation.\nCreation and Validation of the First Infinium DNA Methylation Array for the Human Imprintome\nAuthors: Carreras-Gallo, N.; Dwaraka, V. B.; Jima, D. D.; Skaar, D. A.; Mendez, T. L.; Planchart, A.; Zhou, W.; Jirtle, R. L.; Smith, R.; Hoyo, C.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575646\nBackgroundDifferentially methylated imprint control regions (ICRs) regulate the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. Their epigenetic dysregulation by environmental exposures throughout life results in the formation of common chronic diseases. Unfortunately, existing Infinium methylation arrays lack the ability to profile these regions adequately. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the unique method able to profile these regions, but it is very expensive and it requires not only a high coverage but it is also computationally intensive to assess those regions. FindingsTo address this deficiency, we developed a custom methylation array containing 22,819 probes. Among them, 9,757 probes map to 1,088 out of the 1,488 candidate ICRs recently described. To assess the performance of the array, we created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and WGBS, which is the current standard method for assessing the methylation of the Human Imprintome. We compared the methylation levels from the shared CpG sites and obtained a mean R2 = 0.569. We also created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and the Infinium Methylation EPIC v2 array and obtained a mean R2 = 0.796. Furthermore, replication experiments demonstrated high reliability (ICC: 0.799-0.945). ConclusionsOur custom array will be useful for replicable and accurate assessment, mechanistic insight, and targeted investigation of ICRs. This tool should accelerate the discovery of ICRs associated with a wide range of diseases and exposures, and advance our understanding of genomic imprinting and its relevance in development and disease formation throughout the life course.\nSingle-step generation of homozygous knock-out/knock-in individuals in an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade using DIPA-CRISPR\nAuthors: Kondo, K.; Tanaka, A.; Kunieda, T.\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575120\nTardigrades are small aquatic invertebrates known for their remarkable tolerance to diverse extreme stresses. To elucidate the in vivo mechanisms underlying this extraordinary resilience, the genetic manipulation methods in tardigrades have long been desired. Despite our prior success in somatic cell gene-editing by microinjecting Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the body cavity of tardigrades, the generation of gene-edited individuals remained elusive. In this study, employing an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade species, Ramazzottius varieornatus, we established conditions conductive to generating gene-edited tardigrade individuals. Drawing inspiration from the direct parental CRIPSR (DIPA-CRISPR) technique employed in several insects, we simply injected a concentrated Cas9 RNP solution into the body cavity of parental females shortly before their initial oviposition. This approach yielded gene-edited G0 progeny. Notably, only a single allele was predominantly detected at the target locus for each G0 individual, indicative of homozygous mutations. Through co-injecting single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with Cas9 RNPs, we achieved the generation of homozygously knocked-in G0 progeny and these edited-alleles were inherited by G1/G2 progeny. This establishment of a simple method for generating homozygous knock-out/knock-in individuals not only facilitates in vivo analyses of molecular mechanisms underpinning extreme tolerance but also opens avenues for exploring various topics, including Evo-Devo, in tardigrades.\nImpact of Unc-51 Like Kinase 4 (ULK4) on the Reactivity of the Extended Reward System in Response to Conditioned Stimuli\nAuthors: Treutlein, J.; Loehlein, S.; Einenkel, K. E.; Diekhof, E. K.; Gruber, O.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575326\nObjectivesULK4 is an established candidate gene for mental disorders and antipsychotic treatment response and codes for a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the neural stem cell pool and controls cortex development. We investigated the effects of functional genetic variation at the ULK4 locus on the human extended dopaminergic reward system using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a well-established reward paradigm. Methods234 study participants with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data of the extended reward system and with ULK4 genotype data were included in this study. Effects of genetic variation in the ULK4 gene on reward system functioning were determined using the Desire-Reason-Dilemma (DRD) paradigm which allows to assess brain activation in response to conditioned reward stimuli (Diekhof et al. 2010). ResultsAmong common missense variants of the ULK4 gene, variant prioritization revealed strongest functional signatures for variant rs17215589, coding for amino acid exchange Ala715Thr. For rs17215589 minor allele carriers, we detected increased activation responses to conditioned reward stimuli in the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens and several cortical brain regions of the extended reward system. ConclusionsOur findings provide further evidence in humans that genetic variation in ULK4 may increase the vulnerability to mental disorders by modulating the function of the extended reward system. Future studies are needed to confirm the functional modulation of the extended reward system by ULK4 and to specify the role of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.\nThe cytidine deaminase APOBEC3C has unique sequence and genome feature preferences\nAuthors: Brown, G. W.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575754\nAPOBEC proteins are cytidine deaminases that restrict the replication of viruses and transposable elements. Several members of the APOBEC3 family, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3H-I, can access the nucleus and cause what is thought to be indiscriminate deamination of the genome, resulting in mutagenesis and genome instability. Although APOBEC3C is also present in the nucleus, its deamination target preferences are unknown. By expressing human APOBEC3C in a yeast model system, I have defined the APOBEC3C mutation signature, as well as the preferred genome features of APOBEC3C targets. The APOBEC3C mutation signature is distinct from those of the known cancer genome mutators APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. APOBEC3C produces DNA strand-coordinated mutation clusters, and APOBEC3C mutations are enriched near the transcription start sites of active genes. Surprisingly, APOBEC3C lacks the bias for the lagging strand of DNA replication that is seen for APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. The unique preferences of APOBEC3C constitute a mutation profile that will be useful in defining sites of APOBEC3C mutagenesis in human genomes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The language network of the human brain has core components in the inferior frontal cortex and superior/middle temporal cortex, with left-hemisphere dominance in most people. Functional specialization and interconnectivity of these neocortical regions is likely to be reflected in their molecular and cellular profiles. Excitatory connections between cortical regions arise and innervate according to layer-specific patterns. Here we generated a new gene expression dataset from human postmortem cortical tissue samples from core language network regions, using spatial transcriptomics to discriminate gene expression across cortical layers. Integration of these data with existing single-cell expression data identified 56 genes that showed differences in laminar expression profiles between frontal and temporal language cortex together with upregulation in layer II/III and/or layer V/VI excitatory neurons. Based on data from large-scale genome-wide screening in the population, DNA variants within these 56 genes showed set-level associations with inter-individual variation in structural connectivity between left-hemisphere frontal and temporal language cortex, and with predisposition to dyslexia. The axon guidance genes SLIT1 and SLIT2 were consistently implicated. These findings identify region-specific patterns of laminar gene expression as a feature of the brain&#39;s language network.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All published methods for learning about demographic history make the simplifying assumption that the genome evolves neutrally, and do not seek to account for the effects of natural selection on patterns of variation. This is a major concern, as ample work has demonstrated the pervasive effects of natural selection and in particular background selection (BGS) on patterns of genetic variation in diverse species. Simulations and theoretical work have shown that methods to infer changes in effective population size over time (N(t)) become increasingly inaccurate as the strength of linked selection increases. Here, we introduce an extension to the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) algorithm, PSMC&#43;, which explicitly co-models demographic history and natural selection. We benchmark our method using forward-in-time simulations with BGS and find that our approach improves the accuracy of effective population size inference. Leveraging a high resolution map of BGS in humans, we infer considerable changes in the magnitude of inferred effective population size relative to previous reports. Finally, we separately infer N(t) on the X chromosome and on the autosomes in diverse great apes without making a correction for selection, and find that the inferred ratio fluctuates substantially through time in a way that differs across species, showing that uncorrected selection may be an important driver of signals of genetic difference on the X chromosome and autosomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hundreds of human mutations are linked to autism and related disorders, yet the functions of many of these mutated genes during vertebrate neurodevelopment are unclear. We generated 27 zebrafish mutants with presumptive protein-truncating mutations or specific missense variants corresponding to autism-risk alleles in 17 human genes. We observed baseline and stimulus-driven behavioral changes at larval stages, as well as social behavior differences in lines tested as juveniles. Imaging whole-brain activity revealed a near identical activity map for mutations in the unrelated genes kmt5b and hdlbpa, defined by increased activity mainly in the diencephalon. Mutating 7 of the 17 risk genes resulted in substantial brain size differences. Using RNA sequencing, we further defined molecular drivers of the observed phenotypes, identifying targetable disruptions in neuropeptide signaling, neuronal maturation, and cell proliferation. This multi-modal screen nominated brain regions, cell types, and molecular pathways that may contribute to autism susceptibility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Radiotherapy (RT), is a fundamental treatment for malignant tumors and is used in over half of cancer patients. As radiation can promote anti-tumor immune effects, a promising therapeutic strategy is to combine radiation with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, the genetic determinants that impact therapeutic response in the context of combination therapy with radiation and ICI have not been systematically investigated. To unbiasedly identify the tumor intrinsic genetic factors governing such responses, we perform a set of genome-scale CRISPR screens in melanoma cells for cancer survival in response to low-dose genotoxic radiation treatment, in the context of CD8 T cell co-culture and with anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade antibody. Two actin capping proteins, Capza3 and Capg, emerge as top hits that upon inactivation promote the survival of melanoma cells in such settings. Capza3 and Capg knockouts (KOs) in mouse and human cancer cells display persistent DNA damage due to impaired homology directed repair (HDR); along with increased radiation, chemotherapy, and DNA repair inhibitor sensitivity. However, when cancer cells with these genes inactivated were exposed to sublethal radiation, inactivation of such actin capping protein promotes activation of the STING pathway, induction of inhibitory CEACAM1 ligand expression and resistance to CD8 T cell killing. Patient cancer genomics analysis reveals an increased mutational burden in patients with inactivating mutations in CAPG and/or CAPZA3, at levels comparable to other HDR associated genes. There is also a positive correlation between CAPG expression and activation of immune related pathways and CD8 T cell tumor infiltration. Our results unveil the critical roles of actin binding proteins for efficient HDR within cancer cells and demonstrate a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of therapeutic response to radiation and immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on income among individuals of European descent and leveraged the results to investigate the socio-economic health gradient (N=668,288). We found 162 genomic loci associated with a common genetic factor underlying various income measures, all with small effect sizes. Our GWAS-derived polygenic index captures 1 - 4% of income variance, with only one-fourth attributed to direct genetic effects. A phenome-wide association study using this polygenic index showed reduced risks for a broad spectrum of diseases, including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary atherosclerosis, depression, asthma, and back pain. The income factor showed a substantial genetic correlation (0.92, s.e. = .006) with educational attainment (EA). Accounting for EAs genetic overlap with income revealed that the remaining genetic signal for higher income related to better mental health but reduced physical health benefits and increased participation in risky behaviours such as drinking and smoking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression. DNA methylase (DNMT) inhibitors, inhibit global DNA methylation, and have been a key tool in studies of DNA methylation in healthy or disease conditions. A major bottleneck is the lack of tools to induce global DNA methylation. Here, we engineered a CRISPR based approach, that was initially designed, to enable site specific DNA methylation. Using the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system, we unexpectedly found that regardless of the targeted sequence any sgRNA induced global genome-wide DNA methylation. We termed this new method SAM-DNMT3A and show that induction of global DNA methylation is a unique vulnerability in ER-positive breast cancer suggesting a therapeutic approach. Our findings highlight the need of caution when using CRISPR based approaches for inducing DNA methylation and demonstrate a new method for global induction of DNA methylation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDifferentially methylated imprint control regions (ICRs) regulate the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. Their epigenetic dysregulation by environmental exposures throughout life results in the formation of common chronic diseases. Unfortunately, existing Infinium methylation arrays lack the ability to profile these regions adequately. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the unique method able to profile these regions, but it is very expensive and it requires not only a high coverage but it is also computationally intensive to assess those regions.

FindingsTo address this deficiency, we developed a custom methylation array containing 22,819 probes. Among them, 9,757 probes map to 1,088 out of the 1,488 candidate ICRs recently described. To assess the performance of the array, we created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and WGBS, which is the current standard method for assessing the methylation of the Human Imprintome. We compared the methylation levels from the shared CpG sites and obtained a mean R2 = 0.569. We also created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and the Infinium Methylation EPIC v2 array and obtained a mean R2 = 0.796. Furthermore, replication experiments demonstrated high reliability (ICC: 0.799-0.945).

ConclusionsOur custom array will be useful for replicable and accurate assessment, mechanistic insight, and targeted investigation of ICRs. This tool should accelerate the discovery of ICRs associated with a wide range of diseases and exposures, and advance our understanding of genomic imprinting and its relevance in development and disease formation throughout the life course.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades are small aquatic invertebrates known for their remarkable tolerance to diverse extreme stresses. To elucidate the in vivo mechanisms underlying this extraordinary resilience, the genetic manipulation methods in tardigrades have long been desired. Despite our prior success in somatic cell gene-editing by microinjecting Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the body cavity of tardigrades, the generation of gene-edited individuals remained elusive.

In this study, employing an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade species, Ramazzottius varieornatus, we established conditions conductive to generating gene-edited tardigrade individuals. Drawing inspiration from the direct parental CRIPSR (DIPA-CRISPR) technique employed in several insects, we simply injected a concentrated Cas9 RNP solution into the body cavity of parental females shortly before their initial oviposition. This approach yielded gene-edited G0 progeny. Notably, only a single allele was predominantly detected at the target locus for each G0 individual, indicative of homozygous mutations. Through co-injecting single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with Cas9 RNPs, we achieved the generation of homozygously knocked-in G0 progeny and these edited-alleles were inherited by G1/G2 progeny.

This establishment of a simple method for generating homozygous knock-out/knock-in individuals not only facilitates in vivo analyses of molecular mechanisms underpinning extreme tolerance but also opens avenues for exploring various topics, including Evo-Devo, in tardigrades.</p>

We investigated the effects of functional genetic variation at the ULK4 locus on the human extended dopaminergic reward system using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a well-established reward paradigm.

Methods234 study participants with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data of the extended reward system and with ULK4 genotype data were included in this study. Effects of genetic variation in the ULK4 gene on reward system functioning were determined using the Desire-Reason-Dilemma (DRD) paradigm which allows to assess brain activation in response to conditioned reward stimuli (Diekhof et al. 2010).

ResultsAmong common missense variants of the ULK4 gene, variant prioritization revealed strongest functional signatures for variant rs17215589, coding for amino acid exchange Ala715Thr. For rs17215589 minor allele carriers, we detected increased activation responses to conditioned reward stimuli in the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens and several cortical brain regions of the extended reward system.

ConclusionsOur findings provide further evidence in humans that genetic variation in ULK4 may increase the vulnerability to mental disorders by modulating the function of the extended reward system. Future studies are needed to confirm the functional modulation of the extended reward system by ULK4 and to specify the role of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">APOBEC proteins are cytidine deaminases that restrict the replication of viruses and transposable elements. Several members of the APOBEC3 family, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3H-I, can access the nucleus and cause what is thought to be indiscriminate deamination of the genome, resulting in mutagenesis and genome instability. Although APOBEC3C is also present in the nucleus, its deamination target preferences are unknown. By expressing human APOBEC3C in a yeast model system, I have defined the APOBEC3C mutation signature, as well as the preferred genome features of APOBEC3C targets. The APOBEC3C mutation signature is distinct from those of the known cancer genome mutators APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. APOBEC3C produces DNA strand-coordinated mutation clusters, and APOBEC3C mutations are enriched near the transcription start sites of active genes. Surprisingly, APOBEC3C lacks the bias for the lagging strand of DNA replication that is seen for APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. The unique preferences of APOBEC3C constitute a mutation profile that will be useful in defining sites of APOBEC3C mutagenesis in human genomes.</p>
