The influence of this admixture event on variation in the immune-relevant human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region is understudied. Here, we conducted population and immunogenetic analyses on 83 individuals from six EF and LF sites located in present-day Germany. We observed significant shifts in HLA allele frequencies from EF to LF. The HLA diversity increased from EF to LF, likely due to admixture with WHG. However, it was considerably lower than in modern populations. Both EF and LF exhibited a relatively narrow HLA allele spectrum compared to today. This coincides with sparse traces of pathogen DNA, potentially indicating a lower pathogen pressure at the time. We additionally noted that LF resulted from sex-biased admixture from male WHG. TEASERMore restricted HLA allele spectrum and lower diversity in Neolithic farmers than in modern populations\nGenetic variation at 11q23.1 confers colorectal cancer risk by dysregulation of colonic tuft cell transcriptional activator POU2AF2\nAuthors: Rajasekaran, V.; Harris, B. T.; Osborn, R. T.; Smillie, C.; Donnelly, K.; Bacou, M.; Esiri-Bloom, E.; Ooi, L. Y.; Allan, M.; Walker, M.; Reid, S.; Meynert, A.; Grimes, G.; Blackmur, J. P.; Vaughan-Shaw, P. G.; Law, P. J.; Fernandez-Rozadilla, C.; Tomlinson, I. P.; Houlston, R.; Myant, K. B.; Din, F. V. N.; Dunlop, M. G.; Farrington, S. M.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554659\nCommon genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, and exerts local (cis) expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) effects on POU2AF2, COLCA1 and POU2AF3 genes. However, complex linkage disequilibrium and correlated expression at the 11q23.1 locus has thus far hindered elucidation of the mechanisms by which genetic variants impart CRC risk. Here, we establish that rs3087967 is the likely causal eQTL at this locus, co-localising with expression of POU2AF2 and CRC risk. Furthermore, we show trans-eQTL effects on 21 distant target genes, which are highly enriched for Tuft cell markers. Analysis of available scRNAseq, ChIPseq and scATACseq data implicates POU2AF2 as the primary controller of the tuft cell specific trans-genes through POU2F3-correlated genetic regulation. Immunofluorescence demonstrates that the rs3087967 risk genotype (T) is associated with lower tuft cell abundance in human colonic epithelium. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the 11q23.1 risk locus in the mouse germline exacerbated the ApcMin/+ mouse phenotype upon abrogation of Pou2af2 expression specifically. Taken together, we implicate a key protective role of tuft cells in the large bowel and the importance of mis-regulation of POU2AF2 as the prime tuft cell transcriptional activator at this locus.\nHemin decreases cellular aging and enhances healthspan and lifespan through the AMPK pathway\nAuthors: Zhang, Y.; Naaz, A.; Faidzinn, N. A.; Yogasundaram, S.; Cheng, T. Y. N.; Jing, J. L.; Morel Gan, I. W.-H. J.; Junqi, C.; Alfatah, M.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553367\nThe quest to understand and manipulate the mechanisms of cellular aging has far-reaching implications for improving human health and longevity. Our comprehensive effort has led to the discovery of the intriguing anti-aging potential of hemin, an FDA-approved drug primarily used for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Leveraging both yeast and human cell models, we investigate the multifaceted effects of hemin on extending cellular lifespan. Intriguingly, the involvement of the AMPK pathway emerges as a pivotal mechanism underlying hemins anti-aging effects. The exploration of hemins impact on cellular functionality further uncovers its influence on mitochondrial processes. Notably, both mitochondrial-dependent and -independent mechanisms are implicated in hemins ability to extend cellular lifespan, with autophagy playing a significant role in the latter. Additionally, a striking synergy between hemin and the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin is unveiled, underlining the complexity of cellular signaling networks involved in lifespan extension. Translating these findings to human cells, hemin demonstrates an analogous ability to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression, and enhance antioxidant response. The conservation of hemins anti-aging effects across species holds promise for therapeutic applications in addressing age-related diseases and promoting healthier aging.\nIdentification and functional characterisation of a locus for target site integration in Fusarium graminearum\nAuthors: Darino, M.; Urban, M.; Kaur, N.; Machado-Wood, A.; Grimwade-Mann, M.; Smith, D.; Beacham, A.; Hammond-kosack, K.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.553861\nBackgroundFusarium Head Blight is a destructive floral disease of different cereal crops. The Ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg) is one of the main causal agents of FHB in wheat and barley. The role(s) in virulence of Fg genes include genetic studies that involve the transformation of the fungus with different expression cassettes. We have observed in several studies where Fg genes functions were characterised that integration of expression cassettes occurred randomly. Random insertion of a cassette may disrupt gene expression and/or protein functions and hence the overall conclusion of the study. Target site integration (TSI) is an approach that consists in identifying a chromosomal region where the cassette can be inserted. The identification of a suitable locus for TSI in Fg would avert the potential risks of ectopic integration. ResultsHere, we identified a highly conserved intergenic region on chromosome 1 suitable for TSI. We named this intergenic region the TSI locus 1. We developed an efficient cloning vector system based on the Golden Gate method to clone different expression cassettes for use in combination with TSI locus 1. We present evidence that integrations in the TSI locus 1 affects neither fungal virulence nor fungal growth under different stress conditions. Integrations at the TSI locus 1 resulted in the expression of different gene fusions. In addition, the activities of Fg native promoters were not altered by integration into the TSI locus 1. We have developed a bespoke bioinformatic pipeline to analyse the existence of ectopic integrations and tandem insertions of the cassette that may occurred during the transformation process. Finally, we established a protocol to study protein secretion in wheat coleoptiles using confocal microscopy and the TSI locus 1. ConclusionThe TSI locus 1 can be used in Fg and potentially other cereal infecting Fusarium species for diverse studies including promoter activity analysis, secretion, protein localisation studies and gene complementation. The bespoke bioinformatic pipeline developed in this work can be an alternative to southern blotting, the gold standard technique to identify ectopic integration and tandem insertions in fungal transformation.\nVariant-to-function analysis of the childhood obesity chr12q13 locus implicates rs7132908 as a causal variant within the 3' UTR of FAIM2\nAuthors: Littleton, S. H.; Trang, K. B.; Volpe, C. M.; Cook, K.; DeBruyne, N.; Maguire, J. A.; Weidekamp, M. A.; Boehm, K.; Chesi, A.; Pippin, J. A.; Anderson, S. A.; Wells, A. D.; Pahl, M. C.; Grant, S. F.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553157\nThe ch12q13 obesity locus is among the most significant childhood obesity loci identified in genome-wide association studies. This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via an influence on cis-regulation within the genomic region. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant at this locus leveraging a combination of our inhouse 3D genomic data, public domain datasets, and several computational approaches. Using a luciferase reporter assay in human primary astrocytes, we observed allele-specific cis-regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. Motivated by this finding, we went on to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele with CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair to assess changes in gene expression due to genotype and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. We observed that the rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced the expression of FAIM2 along with other genes, decreased the proportion of neurons produced during differentiation, up-regulated cell death gene sets, and conversely down-regulated neuron differentiation gene sets. We have therefore functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant which temporally regulates nearby effector genes at the ch12q13 locus and influences neurodevelopment and survival.\nDecreased accuracy of forensic DNA mixture analysis for groups with lower genetic diversity\nAuthors: Flores, M.; Ly, C.; Ho, E.; Ceberio, N.; Felix, K.; Thorner, H. M.; Guardado, M.; Paunovich, M.; Godek, C.; Kalaydjian, C.; Rohlfs, R.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554311\nForensic investigation of DNA samples from multiple contributors has become commonplace. These complex analyses use statistical frameworks accounting for multiple levels of uncertainty in allelic contributions from different individuals, particularly for samples containing few molecules of DNA. These methods have been thoroughly tested along some axes of variation, but less attention has been paid to accuracy across human genetic variation. Here, we quantify the accuracy of DNA mixture analysis over 244 human groups. We find higher false inclusion rates for mixtures with more contributors, and for groups with lower genetic diversity. Even for two-contributor mixtures where one contributor is known and the reference group is correctly specified, false inclusion rates are 1e-5 or higher for 56 out of 244 groups. This means that, depending on multiple testing, some false inclusions may be expected. These false positives could be lessened with more selective and conservative use of DNA mixture analysis.\nGlial-derived mitochondrial signals impact neuronal proteostasis and aging.\nAuthors: Bar-Ziv, R.; Dutta, N.; Hruby, A.; Sukarto, E.; Henderson, H. R.; Durieux, J.; Tronnes, S. U.; Averbukh, M.; Alcala, A.; Ahmad, Q.; Bolas, T.; Perez, J.; Dishart, J. G.; Vega, M.; Garcia, G.; Higuchi-Sanabria, R.; Dillin, A.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549924\nThe nervous system plays a critical role in maintaining whole-organism homeostasis; neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress can coordinate the induction of protective cellular pathways, such as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT), between tissues. However, these studies largely ignored non-neuronal cells of the nervous system. Here, we found that UPRMT activation in four, astrocyte-like glial cells in the nematode, C. elegans, can promote protein homeostasis by alleviating protein aggregation in neurons. Surprisingly, we find that glial cells utilize small clear vesicles (SCVs) to signal to neurons, which then relay the signal to the periphery using dense-core vesicles (DCVs). This work underlines the importance of glia in establishing and regulating protein homeostasis within the nervous system, which can then impact neuron-mediated effects in organismal homeostasis and longevity. One-Sentence SummaryGlial cells sense mitochondrial stress and signal a beneficial stress signal to promote neuronal health and longevity.\nAbsence of chromosome axis proteins recruitment prevents meiotic recombination chromosome-wide in the budding yeast Lachancea kluyveri\nAuthors: Legrand, S.; Saifudeen, A.; Bordelet, H.; Vernerey, J.; Guille, A.; Bignaut, A.; Thierry, A.; Acquaviva, L.; Gaudin, M.; Sanchez, A.; Johnson, D.; Friedrcih, A.; Schacherer, J.; Neale, M.; Borde, V.; Koszul, R.; llorente, b.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555118\nMeiotic recombination shows broad variations across species and along chromosomes, and is often suppressed at and around genomic regions determining sexual compatibility such as mating type loci in fungi. Here we show that the absence of Spo11-DSBs and meiotic recombination on Lakl0C-left, the chromosome arm containing the sex locus of the Lachancea kluyveri budding yeast, results from the absence of recruitment of the two chromosome axis proteins Red1 and Hop1, essential for proper Spo11-DSBs formation. Furthermore, cytological observation of spread pachytene meiotic chromosomes reveals that Lakl0C-left does not undergo synapsis. However, we show that the behavior of Lakl0C-left is independent of its particularly early replication timing and is not accompanied by any peculiar chromosome structure as detectable by Hi-C in this yet poorly studied yeast. Finally, we observed an accumulation of heterozygous mutations on Lakl0C-left and a sexual dimorphism of the haploid meiotic offspring, supporting a direct effect of this absence of meiotic recombination on L. kluyveri genome evolution and fitness. Because suppression of meiotic recombination on sex chromosomes is widely observed across eukaryotes, the novel mechanism for recombination suppression described here may apply to other species, with the potential to impact sex chromosome evolution.\nHigh-efficiency gene editing in Anopheles sinensis using ReMOT control\nAuthors: Yang, X.; Ling, X.; Sun, Q.; Qiu, P.; Xiang, K.; Hong, J.; He, S.; Chen, J.; Ding, X.; Hu, H.; He, Z.; Chen, B.; Zhou, C.; Qiao, L.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555096\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provides an effective method for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito development and mosquito-borne disease transmission, as well as for exploring genetic control strategies. However, delivering the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex by embryo injection to produce genetic modifications is challenging, is mostly confined to model mosquitoes and specialized laboratories, and has low editing efficiency. Here, we established an effective Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT) control method, enabling the introduction of heritable mutations into Anopheles sinensis, the major malaria vector in China and Southeast Asia, via the injection of female adult mosquitoes. Injection of a mixture of P2C-DsRed and saponin resulted in red fluorescence in the ovaries, with a 100% success rate. Using this system, we knocked-out the pigment synthesis genes, Aswhite and Asyellow, using injected wild-type (WT) females mated with WT males, resulting in the highest efficiency of gene editing among mosquitoes under the same mating conditions. Furthermore, the gene-editing efficiency was increased by at least 2.1-fold using injected WT females mated with mutant males. This improved ReMOT control method exhibits high editing efficiency, with important benefits in terms of functional genomics research and genetic control strategies in An. sinensis. Moreover, this represents a convenient method for gene manipulation in laboratories that are unable to perform embryo injection or that lack embryo-injection equipment.\nUncovering the molecular signatures of russet skin formation in Niagara grapevine (Vitis vinifera x Vitis labrusca)\nAuthors: Niederauer, G. F.; de Oliveira, G. L.; Aono, A. H.; Graciano, D. d. S.; Guerreiro, S. M. C.; Moura, M. F.; de Souza, A. P.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554330\nGrape breeding programs are mostly focused on developing new varieties with high production volume, sugar contents, and phenolic compound diversity combined with resistance and tolerance to the main pathogens under culture and adverse environmental conditions. The 'Niagara' variety (Vitis labrusca x Vitis vinifera) is one of the most widely produced and commercialized table grapes in Brazil. In this work, we selected three Niagara somatic variants with contrasting berry phenotypes and performed morphological and transcriptomic analyses of their berries. Histological sections of the berries were also performed to understand anatomical and chemical composition differences of the berry skin between the genotypes. An RNA-Seq pipeline was implemented, followed by global coexpression network modeling. 'Niagara Steck', an intensified russet mutant with the most extreme phenotype, showed the largest difference in expression and showed selection of coexpressed network modules involved in the development of its russet-like characteristics. Enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes and hub network modules revealed differences in transcription regulation, auxin signaling and cell wall and plasmatic membrane biogenesis. Cutin- and suberin-related genes were also differently expressed, supporting the anatomical differences observed with microscopy.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The northern European Neolithic is characterized by two major demographic events: immigration of early farmers (EF) from Anatolia (5500 BCE) and their admixture (from [~]4200 BCE) with western hunter-gatherers (WHG) forming late farmers (LF). The influence of this admixture event on variation in the immune-relevant human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region is understudied. Here, we conducted population and immunogenetic analyses on 83 individuals from six EF and LF sites located in present-day Germany. We observed significant shifts in HLA allele frequencies from EF to LF. The HLA diversity increased from EF to LF, likely due to admixture with WHG. However, it was considerably lower than in modern populations. Both EF and LF exhibited a relatively narrow HLA allele spectrum compared to today. This coincides with sparse traces of pathogen DNA, potentially indicating a lower pathogen pressure at the time. We additionally noted that LF resulted from sex-biased admixture from male WHG.

        <p class="abstract">Common genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, and exerts local (cis) expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) effects on POU2AF2, COLCA1 and POU2AF3 genes. However, complex linkage disequilibrium and correlated expression at the 11q23.1 locus has thus far hindered elucidation of the mechanisms by which genetic variants impart CRC risk. Here, we establish that rs3087967 is the likely causal eQTL at this locus, co-localising with expression of POU2AF2 and CRC risk. Furthermore, we show trans-eQTL effects on 21 distant target genes, which are highly enriched for Tuft cell markers. Analysis of available scRNAseq, ChIPseq and scATACseq data implicates POU2AF2 as the primary controller of the tuft cell specific trans-genes through POU2F3-correlated genetic regulation. Immunofluorescence demonstrates that the rs3087967 risk genotype (T) is associated with lower tuft cell abundance in human colonic epithelium. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the 11q23.1 risk locus in the mouse germline exacerbated the ApcMin/&#43; mouse phenotype upon abrogation of Pou2af2 expression specifically. Taken together, we implicate a key protective role of tuft cells in the large bowel and the importance of mis-regulation of POU2AF2 as the prime tuft cell transcriptional activator at this locus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The quest to understand and manipulate the mechanisms of cellular aging has far-reaching implications for improving human health and longevity. Our comprehensive effort has led to the discovery of the intriguing anti-aging potential of hemin, an FDA-approved drug primarily used for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Leveraging both yeast and human cell models, we investigate the multifaceted effects of hemin on extending cellular lifespan. Intriguingly, the involvement of the AMPK pathway emerges as a pivotal mechanism underlying hemins anti-aging effects. The exploration of hemins impact on cellular functionality further uncovers its influence on mitochondrial processes. Notably, both mitochondrial-dependent and -independent mechanisms are implicated in hemins ability to extend cellular lifespan, with autophagy playing a significant role in the latter. Additionally, a striking synergy between hemin and the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin is unveiled, underlining the complexity of cellular signaling networks involved in lifespan extension. Translating these findings to human cells, hemin demonstrates an analogous ability to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression, and enhance antioxidant response. The conservation of hemins anti-aging effects across species holds promise for therapeutic applications in addressing age-related diseases and promoting healthier aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFusarium Head Blight is a destructive floral disease of different cereal crops. The Ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg) is one of the main causal agents of FHB in wheat and barley. The role(s) in virulence of Fg genes include genetic studies that involve the transformation of the fungus with different expression cassettes. We have observed in several studies where Fg genes functions were characterised that integration of expression cassettes occurred randomly. Random insertion of a cassette may disrupt gene expression and/or protein functions and hence the overall conclusion of the study. Target site integration (TSI) is an approach that consists in identifying a chromosomal region where the cassette can be inserted. The identification of a suitable locus for TSI in Fg would avert the potential risks of ectopic integration.

ResultsHere, we identified a highly conserved intergenic region on chromosome 1 suitable for TSI. We named this intergenic region the TSI locus 1. We developed an efficient cloning vector system based on the Golden Gate method to clone different expression cassettes for use in combination with TSI locus 1. We present evidence that integrations in the TSI locus 1 affects neither fungal virulence nor fungal growth under different stress conditions. Integrations at the TSI locus 1 resulted in the expression of different gene fusions. In addition, the activities of Fg native promoters were not altered by integration into the TSI locus 1. We have developed a bespoke bioinformatic pipeline to analyse the existence of ectopic integrations and tandem insertions of the cassette that may occurred during the transformation process. Finally, we established a protocol to study protein secretion in wheat coleoptiles using confocal microscopy and the TSI locus 1.

ConclusionThe TSI locus 1 can be used in Fg and potentially other cereal infecting Fusarium species for diverse studies including promoter activity analysis, secretion, protein localisation studies and gene complementation. The bespoke bioinformatic pipeline developed in this work can be an alternative to southern blotting, the gold standard technique to identify ectopic integration and tandem insertions in fungal transformation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ch12q13 obesity locus is among the most significant childhood obesity loci identified in genome-wide association studies. This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via an influence on cis-regulation within the genomic region. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant at this locus leveraging a combination of our inhouse 3D genomic data, public domain datasets, and several computational approaches. Using a luciferase reporter assay in human primary astrocytes, we observed allele-specific cis-regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. Motivated by this finding, we went on to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele with CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair to assess changes in gene expression due to genotype and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. We observed that the rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced the expression of FAIM2 along with other genes, decreased the proportion of neurons produced during differentiation, up-regulated cell death gene sets, and conversely down-regulated neuron differentiation gene sets. We have therefore functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant which temporally regulates nearby effector genes at the ch12q13 locus and influences neurodevelopment and survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Forensic investigation of DNA samples from multiple contributors has become commonplace. These complex analyses use statistical frameworks accounting for multiple levels of uncertainty in allelic contributions from different individuals, particularly for samples containing few molecules of DNA. These methods have been thoroughly tested along some axes of variation, but less attention has been paid to accuracy across human genetic variation. Here, we quantify the accuracy of DNA mixture analysis over 244 human groups. We find higher false inclusion rates for mixtures with more contributors, and for groups with lower genetic diversity. Even for two-contributor mixtures where one contributor is known and the reference group is correctly specified, false inclusion rates are 1e-5 or higher for 56 out of 244 groups. This means that, depending on multiple testing, some false inclusions may be expected. These false positives could be lessened with more selective and conservative use of DNA mixture analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The nervous system plays a critical role in maintaining whole-organism homeostasis; neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress can coordinate the induction of protective cellular pathways, such as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT), between tissues. However, these studies largely ignored non-neuronal cells of the nervous system. Here, we found that UPRMT activation in four, astrocyte-like glial cells in the nematode, C. elegans, can promote protein homeostasis by alleviating protein aggregation in neurons. Surprisingly, we find that glial cells utilize small clear vesicles (SCVs) to signal to neurons, which then relay the signal to the periphery using dense-core vesicles (DCVs). This work underlines the importance of glia in establishing and regulating protein homeostasis within the nervous system, which can then impact neuron-mediated effects in organismal homeostasis and longevity.

        <p class="abstract">Meiotic recombination shows broad variations across species and along chromosomes, and is often suppressed at and around genomic regions determining sexual compatibility such as mating type loci in fungi. Here we show that the absence of Spo11-DSBs and meiotic recombination on Lakl0C-left, the chromosome arm containing the sex locus of the Lachancea kluyveri budding yeast, results from the absence of recruitment of the two chromosome axis proteins Red1 and Hop1, essential for proper Spo11-DSBs formation. Furthermore, cytological observation of spread pachytene meiotic chromosomes reveals that Lakl0C-left does not undergo synapsis. However, we show that the behavior of Lakl0C-left is independent of its particularly early replication timing and is not accompanied by any peculiar chromosome structure as detectable by Hi-C in this yet poorly studied yeast. Finally, we observed an accumulation of heterozygous mutations on Lakl0C-left and a sexual dimorphism of the haploid meiotic offspring, supporting a direct effect of this absence of meiotic recombination on L. kluyveri genome evolution and fitness. Because suppression of meiotic recombination on sex chromosomes is widely observed across eukaryotes, the novel mechanism for recombination suppression described here may apply to other species, with the potential to impact sex chromosome evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provides an effective method for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito development and mosquito-borne disease transmission, as well as for exploring genetic control strategies. However, delivering the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex by embryo injection to produce genetic modifications is challenging, is mostly confined to model mosquitoes and specialized laboratories, and has low editing efficiency. Here, we established an effective Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT) control method, enabling the introduction of heritable mutations into Anopheles sinensis, the major malaria vector in China and Southeast Asia, via the injection of female adult mosquitoes. Injection of a mixture of P2C-DsRed and saponin resulted in red fluorescence in the ovaries, with a 100% success rate. Using this system, we knocked-out the pigment synthesis genes, Aswhite and Asyellow, using injected wild-type (WT) females mated with WT males, resulting in the highest efficiency of gene editing among mosquitoes under the same mating conditions. Furthermore, the gene-editing efficiency was increased by at least 2.1-fold using injected WT females mated with mutant males. This improved ReMOT control method exhibits high editing efficiency, with important benefits in terms of functional genomics research and genetic control strategies in An. sinensis. Moreover, this represents a convenient method for gene manipulation in laboratories that are unable to perform embryo injection or that lack embryo-injection equipment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Grape breeding programs are mostly focused on developing new varieties with high production volume, sugar contents, and phenolic compound diversity combined with resistance and tolerance to the main pathogens under culture and adverse environmental conditions. The &#39;Niagara&#39; variety (Vitis labrusca x Vitis vinifera) is one of the most widely produced and commercialized table grapes in Brazil. In this work, we selected three Niagara somatic variants with contrasting berry phenotypes and performed morphological and transcriptomic analyses of their berries. Histological sections of the berries were also performed to understand anatomical and chemical composition differences of the berry skin between the genotypes. An RNA-Seq pipeline was implemented, followed by global coexpression network modeling. &#39;Niagara Steck&#39;, an intensified russet mutant with the most extreme phenotype, showed the largest difference in expression and showed selection of coexpressed network modules involved in the development of its russet-like characteristics. Enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes and hub network modules revealed differences in transcription regulation, auxin signaling and cell wall and plasmatic membrane biogenesis. Cutin- and suberin-related genes were also differently expressed, supporting the anatomical differences observed with microscopy.</p>
