Notably, family studies are often claimed to provide an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect (or average treatment effect; ATE) of an allele, on the basis of an analogy between the random transmission of alleles from parents to children and a randomized controlled trial. Here, we show that this interpretation does not hold in general. Because Mendelian segregation only randomizes alleles among children of heterozygotes, the effects of alleles in the children of homozygotes are not observable. Consequently, if an allele has different average effects in the children of homozygotes and heterozygotes, as can arise in the presence of gene-by-environment interactions, gene-by-gene interactions, or differences in LD patterns, family studies provide a biased estimate of the average effect in the sample. At a single locus, family-based association studies can be thought of as providing an unbiased estimate of the average effect in the children of heterozygotes (i.e., a local average treatment effect; LATE). This interpretation does not extend to polygenic scores, however, because different sets of SNPs are heterozygous in each family. Therefore, other than under specific conditions, the within-family regression slope of a PGS cannot be assumed to provide an un-biased estimate for any subset or weighted average of families. Instead, family-based studies can be reinterpreted as enabling an unbiased estimate of the extent to which Mendelian segregation at loci in the PGS contributes to the population-level variance in the trait. Because this estimate does not include the between-family variance, however, this interpretation applies to only (roughly) half of the sample PGS variance. In practice, the potential biases of a family-based GWAS are likely smaller than those arising from confounding in a standard, population-based GWAS, and so family studies remain important for the dissection of genetic contributions to phenotypic variation. Nonetheless, the causal interpretation of family-based GWAS estimates is less straightforward than has been widely appreciated.\nMilo2.0 unlocks population genetic analyses of cell state abundance using a count-based mixed model\nAuthors: Kluzer, A.; Marioni, J. C.; Morgan, M. D.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566176\nCell type proportions vary between individuals and are heritable, as demonstrated by statistical genetic analysis of flow cytometry data [1,2]. Higher-resolution cell states can be identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing, the scalability of which now makes it applicable to population-scale cohorts. However, the integration of statistical genetic analysis of cell states using cohort-scale single-cell data requires appropriate algorithms to account for and model the genetic relationships and complex batch-processing inherent to these studies. We describe Milo2.0, which enables the discovery of cell state quantitative trait loci (csQTL), scaling to millions of cells across hundreds of individuals. We identify \u003e 500 csQTLs across peripheral blood immune states and investigate their relationship with the genetic regulation of gene expression. Moreover, we colocalise immune csQTLs with human traits and identify links between immune regulators, cell state abundance and immune-mediated disease.\nGenetic Discovery Enabled by A Large Language Model\nAuthors: Tu, T.; Fang, Z.; Cheng, Z.; Spasic, S.; Palepu, A.; Stankovic, K.; Natarajan, V.; Peltz, G.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566468\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been used in many areas of medicine, and recently large language models (LLMs) have shown potential utility for clinical applications. However, since we do not know if the use of LLMs can accelerate the pace of genetic discovery, we used data generated from mouse genetic models to investigate this possibility. We examined whether a recently developed specialized LLM (Med-PaLM 2) could analyze sets of candidate genes generated from analysis of murine models of biomedical traits. In response to free-text input, Med-PaLM 2 correctly identified the murine genes that contained experimentally verified causative genetic factors for six biomedical traits, which included susceptibility to diabetes and cataracts. Med-PaLM 2 was also able to analyze a list of genes with high impact alleles, which were identified by comparative analysis of murine genomic sequence data, and it identified a causative murine genetic factor for spontaneous hearing loss. Based upon this Med-PaLM 2 finding, a novel bigenic model for susceptibility to spontaneous hearing loss was developed. These results demonstrate Med-PaLM 2 can analyze gene-phenotype relationships and generate novel hypotheses, which can facilitate genetic discovery.\nClark (2023) and the Persistence of Hereditarian Fallacies\nAuthors: Benning, J. W.; Carlson, J.; Shaw, R.; Harpak, A. W.\nScore: 119.5, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565061\nClark (2023) considers the similarity in socioeconomic status between relatives, drawing on records spanning four centuries in England. The paper adapts a classic quantitative genetics model in order to argue the fit of the model to the data suggests that: (1) variation in socioeconomic status is largely determined by additive genetic variation; (2) contemporary English people \"remain correlated in outcomes with their lineage relatives in exactly the same way as in preindustrial England\"; and (3) social mobility has remained static over this time period due to strong assortative mating on a \"social genotype.\" These conclusions are based on a misconstrual of model parameters, which conflates genetic and non-genetic transmission (e.g. of wealth) within families. As we show, there is strong confounding of genetic and non-genetic sources of similarity in these data. Inconsistent with claims (2) and (3), we show that familial correlations in status are variable--generally decreasing--through the time period analyzed. Lastly, we find that statistical artifacts substantially bias estimates of familial correlations in the paper. Overall, Clark (2023) provides no information about the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to social status.\nIdentifying genetic variants that influence the abundance of cell states in single-cell data\nAuthors: Rumker, L.; Sakaue, S.; Reshef, Y.; Kang, J. B.; Yazar, S.; Alquicira-Hernandez, J.; Valencia, C.; Lagattuta, K. A.; Mah-Som, A.; Nathan, A.; Powell, J. E.; Loh, P.-R.; Raychaudhuri, S.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566919\nIntroductory ParagraphTo understand genetic mechanisms driving disease, it is essential but difficult to map how risk alleles affect the composition of cells present in the body. Single-cell profiling quantifies granular information about tissues, but variant-associated cell states may reflect diverse combinations of the profiled cell features that are challenging to predefine. We introduce GeNA (Genotype-Neighborhood Associations), a statistical tool to identify cell state abundance quantitative trait loci (csaQTLs) in high-dimensional single-cell datasets. Instead of testing associations to predefined cell states, GeNA flexibly identifies the cell states whose abundance is most associated with genetic variants. In a genome-wide survey of scRNA-seq peripheral blood profiling from 969 individuals,1 GeNA identifies five independent loci associated with shifts in the relative abundance of immune cell states. For example, rs3003-T (p=1.96x10-11) associates with increased abundance of NK cells expressing TNF- response programs. This csaQTL colocalizes with increased risk for psoriasis, an autoimmune disease that responds to anti-TNF treatments. Flexibly characterizing csaQTLs for granular cell states may help illuminate how genetic background alters cellular composition to confer disease risk.\nBenchmarking kinship estimation tools for ancient genomes using pedigree simulations\nAuthors: Aktürk, S.; Mapelli, I.; Güler, M. N.; Gürün, K.; Katırcıoglu, B.; Vural, K. B.; Saglıcan, E.; Cetin, M.; Yaka, R.; Sürer, E.; Atag, G.; Cokoglu, S. S.; Sevkar, A.; Altınısık, N. E.; Koptekin, D.; Somel, M.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566300\nThere is growing interest in uncovering genetic kinship patterns in past societies using low-coverage paleogenomes. Here, we benchmark four tools for kinship estimation with such data: lcMLkin, NgsRelate, KIN, and READ, which differ in their input, IBD-estimation methods and statistical approaches. We used pedigree and ancient genome sequence simulations to evaluate these tools when only a limited number (1K to 50K) of shared SNPs (with minor allele frequency [\u0026ge;]0.01) are available. The performance of all four tools was comparable using [\u0026ge;]20K SNPs. We found that first-degree related pairs can be accurately classified even with 1K SNPs, with 85% F1 scores using READ and 96% using NgsRelate or lcMLkin. Distinguishing third-degree relatives from unrelated pairs or second-degree relatives was also possible with high accuracy (F1 \u003e90%) with 5K SNPs using NgsRelate and lcMLkin, while READ and KIN showed lower success (69% and 79%, respectively). Meanwhile, noise in population allele frequencies and inbreeding (first cousin mating) led to deviations in kinship coefficients, with different sensitivities across tools. We conclude that using multiple tools in parallel might be an effective approach to achieve robust estimates on ultra-low coverage genomes.\nDistinct and interdependent functions of three RING proteins regulate recombination during mammalian meiosis\nAuthors: Ito, M.; Yun, Y.; Kulkarni, D. S.; Sandhu, S.; Nunez, B.; Hu, L.; Lee, K.; Lim, N.; Hirota, R.; Prendergast, R.; Huang, C.; Huang, I.; Hunter, N.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566091\nCrossing-over between homologous chromosomes is essential for accurate segregation during meiosis. In mammals, factors required for crossing over include RNF212 and HEI10, RING-finger domain proteins implicated in modification by SUMO and ubiquitin, respectively. Here we show that a third RING protein, RNF212B, is essential for crossing over in mouse and characterize its relationships with RNF212 and HEI10. Mutant analysis indicates that, analogous to RNF212, RNF212B regulates recombination occurring in the context of synapsed chromosomes by stabilizing pro-crossover factors, regulating the progression of recombination, and enabling the differentiation and maturation of crossover-specific recombination complexes. Also, like RNF212, RNF212B localizes between synapsed chromosomes, initially as numerous foci along synaptonemal complexes (SCs) before undergoing HEI10-dependent redistribution to accumulate at prospective crossover sites. Despite these similarities, accumulation of RNF212B at nascent crossover sites is much greater than RNF212 and occurs earlier, coincident with the appearance of HEI10 foci, implicating concerted action of RNF212B and HEI10 in the differentiation of crossover sites. RNF212B localization also shows greater dependence on DNA double-strand breaks and SC formation than RNF212. Together, our analysis delineates three distinct but interdependent RING proteins that regulate meiotic recombination by integrating signals from DSBs, synapsis, the cell-cycle, and developing crossover sites.\nModeling recent positive selection in Americans of European ancestry\nAuthors: Temple, S. D.; Waples, R. D.; Browning, S. R.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566947\nRecent positive selection can result in an excess of long identity-by-descent (IBD) haplotype segments. The statistical methods that we propose here address three major objectives in studying classical selective sweeps: scanning for regions of interest, identifying possible sweeping alleles, and estimating a selection coefficient s. First, we implement a selection scan to locate regions of excess IBD rate. Second, we develop a statistic to rank alleles in strong linkage disequilibrium with a putative sweeping allele. We aggregate these scores to estimate the allele frequency of the sweeping allele, even if it is not genotyped. Lastly, we propose an estimator for the selection coefficient and quantify uncertainty using the parametric bootstrap. Comparing against state-of-the-art methods in extensive simulations, we show that our methods are better at pinpointing alleles at low frequency and estimating selection coefficients greater than 0.015. We apply these methods to study positive selection in inferred European ancestry samples from the TOPMed project. We find twelve loci where their IBD rates exceed four standard deviations above the population median. The excess IBD rate at LCT is thirty-five standard deviations above the population median, and our estimates of its selection coefficient imply strong selection within the past 120 to 163 generations. Overall, we present robust and accurate new approaches to study very recent adaptive evolution under mild assumptions.\nExpansion of human centromeric arrays in cells undergoing break-induced replication\nAuthors: Showman, S.; Talbert, P. B.; Xu, Y.; Adeyemi, R. O.; Henikoff, S.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566714\nHuman centromeres are located within -satellite arrays and evolve rapidly, which can lead to individual variation in array lengths. Proposed mechanisms for such alterations in lengths are unequal cross-over between sister chromatids, gene conversion, and break-induced replication. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the massive, complex, and homogeneous organization of centromeric arrays have not been experimentally validated. Here, we use droplet digital PCR assays to demonstrate that centromeric arrays can expand and contract within ~20 somatic cell divisions of a cell line. We find that the frequency of array variation among single-cell-derived subclones ranges from a minimum of ~7% to a maximum of ~100%. Further clonal evolution revealed that centromere expansion is favored over contraction. We find that the homologous recombination protein RAD52 and the helicase PIF1 are required for extensive array change, suggesting that centromere sequence evolution can occur via break-induced replication.\nTrans-eQTL hotspots shape complex traits by modulating cellular states\nAuthors: Renganaath, K.; Albert, F. W.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567054\nRegulatory genetic variation shapes gene expression, providing an important mechanism connecting DNA variation and complex traits. The causal relationships between gene expression and complex traits remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated transcriptomes and 46 genetically complex growth traits in a large cross between two strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We discovered thousands of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth, suggesting functional connections. Local regulatory variation was a minor source of these genetic correlations. Instead, genetic correlations tended to arise from multiple independent trans-acting regulatory loci. Trans-acting hotspots that affect the expression of numerous genes accounted for particularly large fractions of genetic growth variation and of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth. Genes with genetic correlations were enriched for similar biological processes across traits, but with heterogeneous direction of effect. Our results reveal how trans-acting regulatory hotspots shape complex traits by altering cellular states.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Family-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a gold standard for assessing causal effects of alleles and polygenic scores. Notably, family studies are often claimed to provide an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect (or average treatment effect; ATE) of an allele, on the basis of an analogy between the random transmission of alleles from parents to children and a randomized controlled trial. Here, we show that this interpretation does not hold in general. Because Mendelian segregation only randomizes alleles among children of heterozygotes, the effects of alleles in the children of homozygotes are not observable. Consequently, if an allele has different average effects in the children of homozygotes and heterozygotes, as can arise in the presence of gene-by-environment interactions, gene-by-gene interactions, or differences in LD patterns, family studies provide a biased estimate of the average effect in the sample. At a single locus, family-based association studies can be thought of as providing an unbiased estimate of the average effect in the children of heterozygotes (i.e., a local average treatment effect; LATE). This interpretation does not extend to polygenic scores, however, because different sets of SNPs are heterozygous in each family. Therefore, other than under specific conditions, the within-family regression slope of a PGS cannot be assumed to provide an un-biased estimate for any subset or weighted average of families. Instead, family-based studies can be reinterpreted as enabling an unbiased estimate of the extent to which Mendelian segregation at loci in the PGS contributes to the population-level variance in the trait. Because this estimate does not include the between-family variance, however, this interpretation applies to only (roughly) half of the sample PGS variance. In practice, the potential biases of a family-based GWAS are likely smaller than those arising from confounding in a standard, population-based GWAS, and so family studies remain important for the dissection of genetic contributions to phenotypic variation. Nonetheless, the causal interpretation of family-based GWAS estimates is less straightforward than has been widely appreciated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell type proportions vary between individuals and are heritable, as demonstrated by statistical genetic analysis of flow cytometry data [1,2]. Higher-resolution cell states can be identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing, the scalability of which now makes it applicable to population-scale cohorts. However, the integration of statistical genetic analysis of cell states using cohort-scale single-cell data requires appropriate algorithms to account for and model the genetic relationships and complex batch-processing inherent to these studies. We describe Milo2.0, which enables the discovery of cell state quantitative trait loci (csQTL), scaling to millions of cells across hundreds of individuals. We identify &gt; 500 csQTLs across peripheral blood immune states and investigate their relationship with the genetic regulation of gene expression. Moreover, we colocalise immune csQTLs with human traits and identify links between immune regulators, cell state abundance and immune-mediated disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in many areas of medicine, and recently large language models (LLMs) have shown potential utility for clinical applications. However, since we do not know if the use of LLMs can accelerate the pace of genetic discovery, we used data generated from mouse genetic models to investigate this possibility. We examined whether a recently developed specialized LLM (Med-PaLM 2) could analyze sets of candidate genes generated from analysis of murine models of biomedical traits. In response to free-text input, Med-PaLM 2 correctly identified the murine genes that contained experimentally verified causative genetic factors for six biomedical traits, which included susceptibility to diabetes and cataracts. Med-PaLM 2 was also able to analyze a list of genes with high impact alleles, which were identified by comparative analysis of murine genomic sequence data, and it identified a causative murine genetic factor for spontaneous hearing loss. Based upon this Med-PaLM 2 finding, a novel bigenic model for susceptibility to spontaneous hearing loss was developed. These results demonstrate Med-PaLM 2 can analyze gene-phenotype relationships and generate novel hypotheses, which can facilitate genetic discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clark (2023) considers the similarity in socioeconomic status between relatives, drawing on records spanning four centuries in England. The paper adapts a classic quantitative genetics model in order to argue the fit of the model to the data suggests that: (1) variation in socioeconomic status is largely determined by additive genetic variation; (2) contemporary English people &#34;remain correlated in outcomes with their lineage relatives in exactly the same way as in preindustrial England&#34;; and (3) social mobility has remained static over this time period due to strong assortative mating on a &#34;social genotype.&#34; These conclusions are based on a misconstrual of model parameters, which conflates genetic and non-genetic transmission (e.g. of wealth) within families. As we show, there is strong confounding of genetic and non-genetic sources of similarity in these data. Inconsistent with claims (2) and (3), we show that familial correlations in status are variable--generally decreasing--through the time period analyzed. Lastly, we find that statistical artifacts substantially bias estimates of familial correlations in the paper. Overall, Clark (2023) provides no information about the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors to social status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introductory ParagraphTo understand genetic mechanisms driving disease, it is essential but difficult to map how risk alleles affect the composition of cells present in the body. Single-cell profiling quantifies granular information about tissues, but variant-associated cell states may reflect diverse combinations of the profiled cell features that are challenging to predefine. We introduce GeNA (Genotype-Neighborhood Associations), a statistical tool to identify cell state abundance quantitative trait loci (csaQTLs) in high-dimensional single-cell datasets. Instead of testing associations to predefined cell states, GeNA flexibly identifies the cell states whose abundance is most associated with genetic variants. In a genome-wide survey of scRNA-seq peripheral blood profiling from 969 individuals,1 GeNA identifies five independent loci associated with shifts in the relative abundance of immune cell states. For example, rs3003-T (p=1.96x10-11) associates with increased abundance of NK cells expressing TNF- response programs. This csaQTL colocalizes with increased risk for psoriasis, an autoimmune disease that responds to anti-TNF treatments. Flexibly characterizing csaQTLs for granular cell states may help illuminate how genetic background alters cellular composition to confer disease risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is growing interest in uncovering genetic kinship patterns in past societies using low-coverage paleogenomes. Here, we benchmark four tools for kinship estimation with such data: lcMLkin, NgsRelate, KIN, and READ, which differ in their input, IBD-estimation methods and statistical approaches. We used pedigree and ancient genome sequence simulations to evaluate these tools when only a limited number (1K to 50K) of shared SNPs (with minor allele frequency [&amp;ge;]0.01) are available. The performance of all four tools was comparable using [&amp;ge;]20K SNPs. We found that first-degree related pairs can be accurately classified even with 1K SNPs, with 85% F1 scores using READ and 96% using NgsRelate or lcMLkin. Distinguishing third-degree relatives from unrelated pairs or second-degree relatives was also possible with high accuracy (F1 &gt;90%) with 5K SNPs using NgsRelate and lcMLkin, while READ and KIN showed lower success (69% and 79%, respectively). Meanwhile, noise in population allele frequencies and inbreeding (first cousin mating) led to deviations in kinship coefficients, with different sensitivities across tools. We conclude that using multiple tools in parallel might be an effective approach to achieve robust estimates on ultra-low coverage genomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes is essential for accurate segregation during meiosis. In mammals, factors required for crossing over include RNF212 and HEI10, RING-finger domain proteins implicated in modification by SUMO and ubiquitin, respectively. Here we show that a third RING protein, RNF212B, is essential for crossing over in mouse and characterize its relationships with RNF212 and HEI10. Mutant analysis indicates that, analogous to RNF212, RNF212B regulates recombination occurring in the context of synapsed chromosomes by stabilizing pro-crossover factors, regulating the progression of recombination, and enabling the differentiation and maturation of crossover-specific recombination complexes. Also, like RNF212, RNF212B localizes between synapsed chromosomes, initially as numerous foci along synaptonemal complexes (SCs) before undergoing HEI10-dependent redistribution to accumulate at prospective crossover sites. Despite these similarities, accumulation of RNF212B at nascent crossover sites is much greater than RNF212 and occurs earlier, coincident with the appearance of HEI10 foci, implicating concerted action of RNF212B and HEI10 in the differentiation of crossover sites. RNF212B localization also shows greater dependence on DNA double-strand breaks and SC formation than RNF212. Together, our analysis delineates three distinct but interdependent RING proteins that regulate meiotic recombination by integrating signals from DSBs, synapsis, the cell-cycle, and developing crossover sites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent positive selection can result in an excess of long identity-by-descent (IBD) haplotype segments. The statistical methods that we propose here address three major objectives in studying classical selective sweeps: scanning for regions of interest, identifying possible sweeping alleles, and estimating a selection coefficient s. First, we implement a selection scan to locate regions of excess IBD rate. Second, we develop a statistic to rank alleles in strong linkage disequilibrium with a putative sweeping allele. We aggregate these scores to estimate the allele frequency of the sweeping allele, even if it is not genotyped. Lastly, we propose an estimator for the selection coefficient and quantify uncertainty using the parametric bootstrap. Comparing against state-of-the-art methods in extensive simulations, we show that our methods are better at pinpointing alleles at low frequency and estimating selection coefficients greater than 0.015. We apply these methods to study positive selection in inferred European ancestry samples from the TOPMed project. We find twelve loci where their IBD rates exceed four standard deviations above the population median. The excess IBD rate at LCT is thirty-five standard deviations above the population median, and our estimates of its selection coefficient imply strong selection within the past 120 to 163 generations. Overall, we present robust and accurate new approaches to study very recent adaptive evolution under mild assumptions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human centromeres are located within -satellite arrays and evolve rapidly, which can lead to individual variation in array lengths. Proposed mechanisms for such alterations in lengths are unequal cross-over between sister chromatids, gene conversion, and break-induced replication. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the massive, complex, and homogeneous organization of centromeric arrays have not been experimentally validated. Here, we use droplet digital PCR assays to demonstrate that centromeric arrays can expand and contract within ~20 somatic cell divisions of a cell line. We find that the frequency of array variation among single-cell-derived subclones ranges from a minimum of ~7% to a maximum of ~100%. Further clonal evolution revealed that centromere expansion is favored over contraction. We find that the homologous recombination protein RAD52 and the helicase PIF1 are required for extensive array change, suggesting that centromere sequence evolution can occur via break-induced replication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulatory genetic variation shapes gene expression, providing an important mechanism connecting DNA variation and complex traits. The causal relationships between gene expression and complex traits remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated transcriptomes and 46 genetically complex growth traits in a large cross between two strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We discovered thousands of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth, suggesting functional connections. Local regulatory variation was a minor source of these genetic correlations. Instead, genetic correlations tended to arise from multiple independent trans-acting regulatory loci. Trans-acting hotspots that affect the expression of numerous genes accounted for particularly large fractions of genetic growth variation and of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth. Genes with genetic correlations were enriched for similar biological processes across traits, but with heterogeneous direction of effect. Our results reveal how trans-acting regulatory hotspots shape complex traits by altering cellular states.</p>
