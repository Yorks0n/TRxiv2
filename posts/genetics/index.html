However, existing tools for locus specific hypermutation and evolution in the native genome context are limited. Here we present a novel programmable platform for long-range, locus-specific hypermutation called helicase-assisted continuous editing (HACE). HACE leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to target a processive helicase-deaminase fusion that incurs mutations across large (\u003e1000 bp) genomic intervals. We applied HACE to identify mutations in MEK1 that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in SF3B1-dependent mis-splicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69. HACE provides a powerful tool for investigating coding and noncoding variants, uncovering combinatorial sequence-to-function relationships, and evolving new biological functions. One Sentence SummaryWe developed a tool for continuous, long-range, targeted diversification of endogenous mammalian genomes and used it to explore the function of genetic variants in both coding and non-coding regions.\nRepairing a deleterious domestication variant in a floral regulator of tomato by base editing\nAuthors: Glaus, A. N.; Brechet, M.; Lebeigle, L.; Iwaszkiewicz, J.; Ambrosini, G.; Julca, I.; Zhang, J.; Roberts, R.; Iseli, C.; Guex, N.; Jimenez-Gomez, J. M.; Glover, N.; Martin, G. B.; Strickler, S. R.; Soyk, S.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577624\nCrop genomes accumulated deleterious mutations, a symptom known as the cost of domestication. Precision genome editing has been proposed to eliminate such potentially harmful mutations, however, experimental demonstration is lacking. Here, we identified a deleterious mutation in the tomato transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF SP2 (SSP2), which became prevalent in the domesticated germplasm and diminished DNA-binding to genome-wide targets. We found that SSP2 acts partially redundant with its paralog SSP to regulate shoot and inflorescence architecture. However, redundancy was compromised during tomato domestication and completely lost in the closely-related species Physalis grisea, in which a single ortholog regulates shoot branching. We applied base editing to directly repair the deleterious mutation in cultivated tomato and obtained plants with compact growth that provide an early fruit yield. Our work shows how deleterious variants sensitized modern genotypes for phenotypic tuning and illustrates how repairing deleterious mutations with genome editing allows for predictable crop improvement.\nPatient derived model of UBA5-associated encephalopathy identifies defects in neurodevelopment and highlights potential therapies\nAuthors: Chen, H.; Wang, Y.-D.; Blan, A. W.; Almanza-Fuerte, E. P.; Bonkowski, E. S.; Bajpai, R.; Pruett-Miller, S. M.; Mefford, H. C.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577254\nUBA5 encodes for the E1 enzyme of the UFMylation cascade, which plays an essential role in ER homeostasis. The clinical phenotypes of UBA5-associated encephalopathy include developmental delays, epilepsy and intellectual disability. To date, there is no humanized neuronal model to study the cellular and molecular consequences of UBA5 pathogenic variants. We developed and characterized patient-derived cortical organoid cultures and identified defects in GABAergic interneuron development. We demonstrated aberrant neuronal firing and microcephaly phenotypes in patient-derived organoids. Mechanistically, we show that ER homeostasis is perturbed along with exacerbated unfolded protein response pathway in cells and organoids expressing UBA5 pathogenic variants. We also assessed two gene expression modalities that augmented UBA5 expression to rescue aberrant molecular and cellular phenotypes. Our study provides a novel humanized model that allows further investigations of UBA5 variants in the brain and highlights novel systemic approaches to alleviate cellular aberrations for this rare, developmental disorder. One-sentence summaryPatient derived model of UBA5-assoicated DEE recapitulated disease phenotype, revealed defects in neurodevelopment, and highlighted potential therapies.\nA Genetic Screen for regulators of CNS morphology in Drosophila\nAuthors: Lacin, H.; Zhu, Y.; DiPaola, J.; Wilson, B. A.; Zhu, Y.; Skeath, J. B.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574922\nDespite increasing in mass approximately 100-fold during larval life, the Drosophila CNS maintains its characteristic form during this rapid growth phase. Dynamic interactions between the overlying basement membrane and underlying surface glia are known to regulate CNS structure in Drosophila, but the genes and pathways that establish and maintain CNS morphology during development remain poorly characterized. To identify genes that regulate CNS shape in Drosophila, we conducted an EMS-based, forward genetic screen of the second chromosome, uncovered 50 mutations that disrupt CNS structure, and mapped these alleles to 17 genes. Whole genome sequencing revealed the affected gene for all but one gene. Identified genes include well characterized regulators of tissue shape, like Laminin B1, viking, and Collagen 4a1, as well as characterized genes, such as Toll-2 and Rme-8, with no known role in regulating CNS structure. We also uncovered that papilin and dC1GalTA likely act in the same pathway to regulate CNS structure and found that a glucuronosyltransferase that regulates Dystroglycan function in mammals is required to maintain CNS shape in Drosophila. Finally, we show that the senseless-2 transcription factor is expressed and functions specifically in surface glia found on peripheral nerves but not those on the CNS proper to govern CNS structure, identifying the first gene that functionally subdivides a glial subtype along the peripheral-central axis. Future work on these genes should help clarify the genetic mechanisms that ensure the homeostasis of CNS shape and form during development.\nAll three MutL complexes are required for repeat expansion in a human stem cell model of CAG-repeat expansion mediated glutaminase deficiency.\nAuthors: Hayward, B. E.; Usdin, K.; Kumari, D.; van Kuilenburg, A. B.; van Karnebeek, C. D. M.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573357\nThe Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) arise from expansion of a disease-specific short tandem repeat (STR). Different REDs differ with respect to the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of expansion and whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in the 5 UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as [~]100 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels of R-looped formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-cas9 knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutL and MutL{psi}, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood MutL complex, MutL{beta}, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, many, if not all, REDs likely expand via in very similar ways.\nHighly parameterized polygenic scores tend to overfit to population stratification via random effects\nAuthors: Aw, A. J.; McRae, J.; Rahmani, E.; Song, Y. S.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.27.577589\nPolygenic scores (PGSs), increasingly used in clinical settings, frequently include many genetic variants, with performance typically peaking at thousands of variants. Such highly parameterized PGSs often include variants that do not pass a genome-wide significance threshold. We propose a mathematical perspective that renders the effects of many of these nonsignificant variants random rather than causal, with the randomness capturing population structure. We devise methods to assess variant effect randomness and population stratification bias. Applying these methods to 141 traits from the UK Biobank, we find that, for many PGSs, the effects of non-significant variants are considerably random, with the extent of randomness associated with the degree of overfitting to population structure of the discovery cohort. Our findings explain why highly parameterized PGSs simultaneously have superior cohort-specific performance and limited generalizability, suggesting the critical need for variant randomness tests in PGS evaluation.

However, the mechanisms coordinating these two genomes to control mitochondrial biogenesis remain largely unknown. To identify transcription circuits involved in these processes, we performed a candidate RNAi screen in developing eyes that had reduced mitochondrial DNA contents. We reasoned that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis would synergistically interact with mtDNA deficiency in disrupting tissue development. Over 638 transcription factors annotated in the fly genome, we identified 77 transcription factors that may be involved in mitochondrial genome maintenance and gene expression. Additional genetic and genomic analyses revealed that a novel transcription factor, CG1603, and its upstream factor YL-1 are essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. We constructed a regulator network among positive hits using the published CHIP-seq data. The network analysis revealed extensive connections, and complex hierarchical organization underlying the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.\nSomatic epigenetic drift during shoot branching: a cell lineage-based model\nAuthors: Chen, Y.; Burian, A.; Johannes, F.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577071\nPlant architecture is shaped by the continuous production of new organs, most of which emerge post-embryonically. This process includes the formation of new lateral branches along existing shoots. Shoot branching is fundamental to plant development, plant-environment interactions, and vegetative propagation. Current empirical evidence supports a \"detached meristem\" model as the cellular basis of lateral shoot initiation. In this model, a small number of undifferentiated cells are \"sampled\" from the periphery of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to act as precursors for axillary buds, which eventually develop into new shoots. Repeated branching thus creates a series of cellular bottlenecks (i.e. somatic drift) that affect how de novo genetic and epigenetic mutations propagate through the plant body during development. Somatic drift could be particularly relevant for epigenetic changes in the form of stochastic DNA methylation gains and losses (i.e. spontaneous epimutations), as they have been shown to arise rapidly with each cell division. Here, we formalize a special case of the \"detached meristem\" model, where pre-cursor cells are randomly sampled from the SAM periphery in a way that maximizes cell lineage independence. By following a population of SAM cells through repeated branching processes, we show that somatic drift gives rise to a complex mixture of cellular phylogenies, which shape the evolution of cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity within the SAM over time. This process is dependent on the number of branch points, the strength of somatic drift as well as the epimutation rate. For many realistic cell biological settings, our model predicts that cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity in the SAM converges to non-zero states during development, suggesting that epigenetic variation is an inherent property of the SAM cell population. Our insights have direct implications for empirical studies of somatic (epi)genomic diversity in long-lived perennial and clonal species using bulk or single-cell sequencing approaches.\nThe novel linkage between Fuz and Gpr161 genes regulates sonic hedgehog signaling during mouse embryonic development.\nAuthors: Kim, S. E.; Kim, H. Y.; Wlodarczyk, B. J.; Finnell, R. H.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575263\nSonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates embryonic morphogenesis utilizing primary cilia, the cell antenna acting as a signaling hub. Fuz, an effector of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, involves Shh signaling via cilia formation, while the G protein-coupled receptor 161 (Gpr161) is a negative regulator of Shh signaling. The range of phenotypic malformations observed in mice bearing mutations in either of these two genes is similar; however, their functional relations have not been previously explored. This study identified the genetic and biochemical link between Fuz and Gpr161 in mouse embryonic development. Fuz was genetically epistatic to Gpr161 via Shh signaling during mouse embryonic development. The FUZ biochemically interacted with GPR161, and Fuz regulated Gpr161 ciliary trafficking via {beta}-arrestin2. Our study suggested the novel Gpr161-Fuz axis that regulates Shh signaling during mouse embryonic development. Summary statementThis study illuminates the novel genetic and biochemical linkages between Fuz and Gpr161 to regulate sonic hedgehog signaling during mouse embryonic development.\nThe influence of early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal diet on offspring DNA methylation: a cross-species study\nAuthors: Bestry, M.; Larcombe, A. N.; Kresoje, N.; Chivers, E. K.; Bakker, C.; Fitzpatrick, J. P.; Elliott, E. J.; Craig, J. M.; Muggli, E.; Halliday, J.; Hutchinson, D.; Buckberry, S.; Lister, R.; Symons, M.; Martino, D.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.544516\nAlcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in new-born pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A major challenge in human genomics is to decipher the context specific relationship of sequence to function. However, existing tools for locus specific hypermutation and evolution in the native genome context are limited. Here we present a novel programmable platform for long-range, locus-specific hypermutation called helicase-assisted continuous editing (HACE). HACE leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to target a processive helicase-deaminase fusion that incurs mutations across large (&gt;1000 bp) genomic intervals. We applied HACE to identify mutations in MEK1 that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in SF3B1-dependent mis-splicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69. HACE provides a powerful tool for investigating coding and noncoding variants, uncovering combinatorial sequence-to-function relationships, and evolving new biological functions.

One Sentence SummaryWe developed a tool for continuous, long-range, targeted diversification of endogenous mammalian genomes and used it to explore the function of genetic variants in both coding and non-coding regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Crop genomes accumulated deleterious mutations, a symptom known as the cost of domestication. Precision genome editing has been proposed to eliminate such potentially harmful mutations, however, experimental demonstration is lacking. Here, we identified a deleterious mutation in the tomato transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF SP2 (SSP2), which became prevalent in the domesticated germplasm and diminished DNA-binding to genome-wide targets. We found that SSP2 acts partially redundant with its paralog SSP to regulate shoot and inflorescence architecture. However, redundancy was compromised during tomato domestication and completely lost in the closely-related species Physalis grisea, in which a single ortholog regulates shoot branching. We applied base editing to directly repair the deleterious mutation in cultivated tomato and obtained plants with compact growth that provide an early fruit yield. Our work shows how deleterious variants sensitized modern genotypes for phenotypic tuning and illustrates how repairing deleterious mutations with genome editing allows for predictable crop improvement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">UBA5 encodes for the E1 enzyme of the UFMylation cascade, which plays an essential role in ER homeostasis. The clinical phenotypes of UBA5-associated encephalopathy include developmental delays, epilepsy and intellectual disability. To date, there is no humanized neuronal model to study the cellular and molecular consequences of UBA5 pathogenic variants. We developed and characterized patient-derived cortical organoid cultures and identified defects in GABAergic interneuron development. We demonstrated aberrant neuronal firing and microcephaly phenotypes in patient-derived organoids. Mechanistically, we show that ER homeostasis is perturbed along with exacerbated unfolded protein response pathway in cells and organoids expressing UBA5 pathogenic variants. We also assessed two gene expression modalities that augmented UBA5 expression to rescue aberrant molecular and cellular phenotypes. Our study provides a novel humanized model that allows further investigations of UBA5 variants in the brain and highlights novel systemic approaches to alleviate cellular aberrations for this rare, developmental disorder.

        <p class="abstract">Despite increasing in mass approximately 100-fold during larval life, the Drosophila CNS maintains its characteristic form during this rapid growth phase. Dynamic interactions between the overlying basement membrane and underlying surface glia are known to regulate CNS structure in Drosophila, but the genes and pathways that establish and maintain CNS morphology during development remain poorly characterized. To identify genes that regulate CNS shape in Drosophila, we conducted an EMS-based, forward genetic screen of the second chromosome, uncovered 50 mutations that disrupt CNS structure, and mapped these alleles to 17 genes. Whole genome sequencing revealed the affected gene for all but one gene. Identified genes include well characterized regulators of tissue shape, like Laminin B1, viking, and Collagen 4a1, as well as characterized genes, such as Toll-2 and Rme-8, with no known role in regulating CNS structure. We also uncovered that papilin and dC1GalTA likely act in the same pathway to regulate CNS structure and found that a glucuronosyltransferase that regulates Dystroglycan function in mammals is required to maintain CNS shape in Drosophila. Finally, we show that the senseless-2 transcription factor is expressed and functions specifically in surface glia found on peripheral nerves but not those on the CNS proper to govern CNS structure, identifying the first gene that functionally subdivides a glial subtype along the peripheral-central axis. Future work on these genes should help clarify the genetic mechanisms that ensure the homeostasis of CNS shape and form during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) arise from expansion of a disease-specific short tandem repeat (STR). Different REDs differ with respect to the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of expansion and whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in the 5 UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as [~]100 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels of R-looped formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-cas9 knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutL and MutL{psi}, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood MutL complex, MutL{beta}, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, many, if not all, REDs likely expand via in very similar ways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic scores (PGSs), increasingly used in clinical settings, frequently include many genetic variants, with performance typically peaking at thousands of variants. Such highly parameterized PGSs often include variants that do not pass a genome-wide significance threshold. We propose a mathematical perspective that renders the effects of many of these nonsignificant variants random rather than causal, with the randomness capturing population structure. We devise methods to assess variant effect randomness and population stratification bias. Applying these methods to 141 traits from the UK Biobank, we find that, for many PGSs, the effects of non-significant variants are considerably random, with the extent of randomness associated with the degree of overfitting to population structure of the discovery cohort. Our findings explain why highly parameterized PGSs simultaneously have superior cohort-specific performance and limited generalizability, suggesting the critical need for variant randomness tests in PGS evaluation.

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial genome encodes handful genes of respiratory chain complexes, whereas all the remaining mitochondrial proteins are encoded on the nuclear genome. However, the mechanisms coordinating these two genomes to control mitochondrial biogenesis remain largely unknown. To identify transcription circuits involved in these processes, we performed a candidate RNAi screen in developing eyes that had reduced mitochondrial DNA contents. We reasoned that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis would synergistically interact with mtDNA deficiency in disrupting tissue development. Over 638 transcription factors annotated in the fly genome, we identified 77 transcription factors that may be involved in mitochondrial genome maintenance and gene expression. Additional genetic and genomic analyses revealed that a novel transcription factor, CG1603, and its upstream factor YL-1 are essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. We constructed a regulator network among positive hits using the published CHIP-seq data. The network analysis revealed extensive connections, and complex hierarchical organization underlying the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant architecture is shaped by the continuous production of new organs, most of which emerge post-embryonically. This process includes the formation of new lateral branches along existing shoots. Shoot branching is fundamental to plant development, plant-environment interactions, and vegetative propagation. Current empirical evidence supports a &#34;detached meristem&#34; model as the cellular basis of lateral shoot initiation. In this model, a small number of undifferentiated cells are &#34;sampled&#34; from the periphery of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to act as precursors for axillary buds, which eventually develop into new shoots. Repeated branching thus creates a series of cellular bottlenecks (i.e. somatic drift) that affect how de novo genetic and epigenetic mutations propagate through the plant body during development. Somatic drift could be particularly relevant for epigenetic changes in the form of stochastic DNA methylation gains and losses (i.e. spontaneous epimutations), as they have been shown to arise rapidly with each cell division.

Here, we formalize a special case of the &#34;detached meristem&#34; model, where pre-cursor cells are randomly sampled from the SAM periphery in a way that maximizes cell lineage independence. By following a population of SAM cells through repeated branching processes, we show that somatic drift gives rise to a complex mixture of cellular phylogenies, which shape the evolution of cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity within the SAM over time. This process is dependent on the number of branch points, the strength of somatic drift as well as the epimutation rate. For many realistic cell biological settings, our model predicts that cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity in the SAM converges to non-zero states during development, suggesting that epigenetic variation is an inherent property of the SAM cell population.

Our insights have direct implications for empirical studies of somatic (epi)genomic diversity in long-lived perennial and clonal species using bulk or single-cell sequencing approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates embryonic morphogenesis utilizing primary cilia, the cell antenna acting as a signaling hub. Fuz, an effector of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, involves Shh signaling via cilia formation, while the G protein-coupled receptor 161 (Gpr161) is a negative regulator of Shh signaling. The range of phenotypic malformations observed in mice bearing mutations in either of these two genes is similar; however, their functional relations have not been previously explored. This study identified the genetic and biochemical link between Fuz and Gpr161 in mouse embryonic development. Fuz was genetically epistatic to Gpr161 via Shh signaling during mouse embryonic development. The FUZ biochemically interacted with GPR161, and Fuz regulated Gpr161 ciliary trafficking via {beta}-arrestin2. Our study suggested the novel Gpr161-Fuz axis that regulates Shh signaling during mouse embryonic development.

Summary statementThis study illuminates the novel genetic and biochemical linkages between Fuz and Gpr161 to regulate sonic hedgehog signaling during mouse embryonic development.</p>

We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in new-born pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.</p>
