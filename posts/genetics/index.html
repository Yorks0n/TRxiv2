R.\nScore: 25.9, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552281\nAn understanding of genetic differences between populations is essential for avoiding confounding in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and understanding the evolution of human traits. Polygenic risk scores constructed in one group perform poorly in highly genetically-differentiated populations, for reasons which remain controversial. We developed a statistical ancestry inference pipeline able to decompose ancestry both within and between countries, and applied it to the UK Biobank data. This identifies fine-scale patterns of genetic relatedness not captured by standard and widely used principal components (PCs), and allows fine-scale population stratification correction that removes both false positive and false negative associations for traits with geographic correlations. We also develop and apply ANCHOR, an approach leveraging segments of distinct ancestries within individuals to estimate similarity in underlying causal effect sizes between groups, using an existing PGS. Applying ANCHOR to \u003e8000 people of mixed African and European ancestry, we demonstrate that estimated causal effect sizes are highly similar across these ancestries for 26 of 29 quantitative molecular and non-molecular phenotypes (mean correlation 0.98 +/-0.08), providing evidence that gene-environment and gene-gene interactions do not play major roles in the poor prediction of European-ancestry PRS scores in African populations for these traits, contradicting previous findings. Instead our results provide optimism that shared causal mutations operate similarly in different groups, focussing the challenge of improving GWAS \"portability\" between groups on joint fine-mapping.\nBroad functional profiling of fission yeast proteins using phenomics and machine learning\nAuthors: Rodriguez-Lopez, M.; Bordin, N.; Lees, J.; Scholes, H.; Hassan, S.; Saintain, Q.; Kamrad, S.; Orengo, C.; BaÌˆhler, J.\nScore: 68.9, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.05.535764\nMany proteins remain poorly characterized even in well-studied organisms, presenting a bottleneck for research. We applied phenomics and machine-learning approaches with Schizosaccharomyces pombe for broad cues on protein functions. We assayed colony-growth phenotypes to measure the fitness of deletion mutants for 3509 non-essential genes in 131 conditions with different nutrients, drugs, and stresses. These analyses exposed phenotypes for 3492 mutants, including 124 mutants of priority unstudied proteins conserved in humans, providing varied functional clues. For example, over 900 proteins were newly implicated in the resistance to oxidative stress. Phenotype-correlation networks suggested roles for poorly characterized proteins through guilt by association with known proteins. For complementary functional insights, we predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms using machine learning methods exploiting protein-network and protein-homology data (NET-FF). We obtained 56,594 high-scoring GO predictions, of which 22,060 also featured high information content. Our phenotype-correlation data and NET-FF predictions showed a strong concordance with existing PomBase GO annotations and protein networks, with integrated analyses revealing 1,675 novel GO predictions for 783 genes, including 47 predictions for 23 priority unstudied proteins. Experimental validation identified new proteins involved in cellular ageing, showing that these predictions and phenomics data provide a rich resource to uncover new protein functions.\nShared and distinct molecular effects of regulatory genomic variants provide insight into mechanisms of distal enhancer-promoter communication\nAuthors: Ray-Jones, H.; Song, Z.; Haglund, A.; Artemov, P.; Della Rosa, M.; Burden, F.; Kreuzhuber, R.; Litovskikh, A.; Tan, V. X. H.; Chan, L. T.; Frontini, M.; Wallace, C.; Malysheva, V.; Bottolo, L.; Vigorito, E.; Spivakov, M.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551251\nTranscriptional enhancers control spatiotemporal gene expression and commonly engage in long-range chromosomal contacts with gene promoters. However, the relationship between enhancer activity, enhancer-promoter contact and gene expression is not completely understood. Here, we leverage human genetic variation as a \"natural perturbation\" to dissect this relationship. Focusing on enhancers that harbour genetic variants showing allelic associations with the expression levels of distal genes (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs), we profiled eQTL-promoter contacts using high-resolution Capture Hi-C, as well as chromatin activity by ATAC-sequencing, in primary monocytes isolated from 34 healthy donors. To detect the associations of genetic variants with these molecular phenotypes, we extended a recently proposed Bayesian method that leverages both intra- and interindividual variation. We identified 19 eQTLs associated with differential promoter contacts, most of which also showed an association with chromatin activity. Capitalising on this overlap, we next adapted a Bayesian mapping strategy for detecting variants that exert genetic control across multiple phenotypes, revealing hundreds of putative \"trimodal QTL\" variants jointly associated with enhancer activity, connectivity, and gene expression. A subset of these variants was predicted to affect the binding of a diverse range of transcription factors, in part through disruption of the binding motifs for either these factors or their binding partners. In addition, we identified a variant with opposite effects on promoter contact and expression levels of its target gene, PCK2. We show that this variant disrupts the canonical binding motif of the architectural protein CTCF and likely perturbs the chromatin insulation of the PCK2 promoter from more distal enhancers. Finally, multiple identified QTLs overlapped known disease susceptibility loci, pointing to the potential role of enhancer-promoter communication in mediating the pathological effects of non-coding genetic variation. Jointly, our findings suggest an inherent functional link between the activity and connectivity of enhancers with relevance for human disease and highlight the role of genetically-determined chromatin boundaries in gene expression control.\nGetPrimers: a generalized PCR-based genetic targeting primer designer enabling easy and standardized targeted gene modification across multiple systems\nAuthors: Miao, Z.; Wang, H.; Tu, X.; Huang, Z.; Huang, S.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Huang, Z.; Li, H.; Jiao, Y.; Gao, S.; Zhou, Z.; Shan, C.-M.; Li, J.; Yue, J.-X.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.552711\nGenetic targeting (e.g., gene knockout and tagging) based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a simple yet powerful approach for studying gene functions. Although it was originally developed in classic budding and fission yeast models, the same principle equally applies to other eukaryotic systems with efficient homologous recombination. One-step-PCR-based genetic targeting is more conventionally used but the sizes of the homologous arms that it generates for recombination-mediated genetic targeting are usually limited. Alternatively, gene targeting can also be performed via fusion PCR, which can create homologous arms that are orders of magnitude larger, therefore substantially increases the efficiency of recombination-mediated genetic targeting. Here we present GetPrimers (https://www.evomicslab.org/app/getprimers/), a generalized computational framework and web tool to assist automatic targeting and verification primer design for both one-step-PCR-based and fusion-PCR-based genetic targeting experiments. Moreover, GetPrimers by design runs for any given species of any genetic background, with full genome scalability. Therefore, GetPrimers is capable of empowering high-throughput functional genomics assays at multi-population and multi-species levels. Comprehensive experimental validations have been performed for the targeting and verification primers designed by GetPrimers across multiple organism systems and experimental setups. We anticipate GetPrimers to become a highly useful and popular tool to facilitate the easy and standardized gene modification across multiple systems.\nZebrafish models of Mucopolysaccharidosis types IIIA, B, \u0026 C show hyperactivity and changes in oligodendrocyte state\nAuthors: Gerken, E.; Ahmad, S.; Barthelson, K.; Lardelli, M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.550904\nSanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafishs extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.\nA fluorescent sex-sorting technique for insects with the demonstration in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Liu, J.; Rayes, D.; Akbari, O.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553026\nRecent advances in insect genetic engineering offer alternative genetic biocontrol solutions to control populations of pests and disease vectors. While success has been achieved, sex-sorting remains problematic for scaling many genetic biocontrol interventions. Here we describe the development of a sex-sorting technique for female and male selection with a proof-of-concept in D. melanogaster termed SEPARATOR (Sexing Element Produced by Alternative RNA-splicing of A Transgenic Observable Reporter). This approach utilizes dominant fluorescent proteins and differentially spliced introns to ensure sex-specific expression. The system has the potential for adaptability to various insect species and application for high-throughput insect sex-sorting.\nPostzygotic barriers persist despite ongoing introgression in hybridizing Mimulus species\nAuthors: Mantel, S. J.; Sweigart, A. L.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552095\nThe evolution of postzygotic isolation is thought to be a key step in maintaining species boundaries upon secondary contact. Yet the dynamics and persistence of hybrid incompatibilities in naturally hybridizing species is not well understood. Here, we explore these issues with genetic mapping in three independent populations of recombinant inbred lines between naturally hybridizing monkeyflowers Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus from the sympatric Catherine Creek population. We discovered that the three M. guttatus founders differ dramatically in admixture history, with nearly a quarter of one founders genome introgressed from M. nasutus. Comparative genetic mapping in the three RIL populations revealed three new putative inversions, each one segregating among the M. guttatus founders, two due to admixture. We also found strong, genome-wide transmission ratio distortion in all RILs, but patterns were highly variable among the three populations. At least some of this distortion appears to be explained by epistatic selection favoring parental genotypes, but tests of inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium also revealed multiple candidate Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. We also mapped several genetic loci for hybrid pollen viability, including two interacting pairs that coincide with peaks of distortion. Remarkably, even with this limited sample of three M. guttatus lines, we discovered abundant segregating variation for hybrid incompatibilities with M. nasutus, suggesting this population harbors diverse contributors to postzygotic isolation. Moreover, even with substantial admixture, hybrid incompatibilities between Mimulus species persist, suggesting postzygotic isolation might be a potent force in maintaining species barriers in this system.\nWithin-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2: how often are mutations transmitted?\nAuthors: Korosec, C. S.; Wahl, L. M.; Heffernan, J. M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552503\nDespite a relatively low mutation rate, the large number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has allowed for substantial genetic change, leading to a multitude of emerging variants. Using a recently determined mutation rate (per site replication), as well as parameter estimates for within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection, we apply a stochastic transmission-bottleneck model to describe the survival probability of de novo SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For narrow bottlenecks, we find mutations affecting pertarget-cell attachment rate (with phenotypes associated with fusogenicity and ACE2 binding), have similar transmission probabilities to mutations affecting viral load clearance (with phenotypes associated with humoral evasion). We further find that mutations affecting the eclipse rate (with phenotypes associated with reorganization of cellular metabolic processes and synthesis of viral budding precursor material) are highly favoured relative to all other traits examined. We find mutations leading to reduced removal rates of infected cells (with phenotypes associated with innate immune evasion) have limited transmission advantage relative to mutations leading to humoral evasion. Predicted transmission probabilities, however, for mutations affecting innate immune evasion are more consistent with the range of clinically-estimated household transmission probabilities for de novo mutations. This result suggests that although mutations affecting humoral evasion are more easily transmitted when they occur, mutations affecting innate immune evasion may occur more readily. We examine our predictions in the context of a number of previously characterized mutations in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Our work offers both a null model for SARS-CoV-2 substitution rates and predicts which aspects of viral life history are most likely to successfully evolve, despite low mutation rates and repeated transmission bottlenecks.\nVitamin C activates young LINE-1 elements in mouse embryonic stem cells via H3K9me3 demethylation\nAuthors: Cheng, K. C. L.; Frost, J. M.; Sanchez-Luque, F. J.; Garcia-Canadas, M.; Taylor, D.; Yang, W. R.; Irayanar, B.; Sampath, S.; Patani, H.; Agger, K.; Helin, K.; Ficz, G.; Burns, K. H.; Ewing, A. D.; Garcia-Perez, J. L.; Branco, M. R.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552254\nVitamin C (vitC) enhances the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including TET enzymes, which catalyse DNA demethylation, and Jumonji-domain histone demethylases. The epigenetic remodelling promoted by vitC improves the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell derivation, and is required to attain a ground-state of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that closely mimics the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst. However, genome-wide DNA and histone demethylation can lead to upregulation of transposable elements (TEs), and it is not known how vitC addition in culture media affects TE expression in pluripotent stem cells. Here we show that vitC increases the expression of evolutionarily young LINE-1 (L1) elements in mouse ESCs. We find that TET activity is dispensable for these effects, and that instead L1 upregulation occurs largely as a result of H3K9me3 loss mediated by KDM4A/C histone demethylases. Despite increased L1 levels, we did not detect increased somatic insertion rates in vitC-treated cells. Notably, treatment of human ESCs with vitC also increases L1 protein levels, which could impact the genetic and epigenetic stability of human pluripotent stem cells.\nMitochondrial Genome Diversity across the Subphylum Saccharomycotina\nAuthors: Wolters, J. F.; LaBella, A.; Opulente, D.; Rokas, A.; Hittinger, C. T.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551029\nEukaryotic life depends on the functional elements encoded by both the nuclear genome and organellar genomes, such as those contained within the mitochondria. The content, size, and structure of the mitochondrial genome varies across organisms with potentially large implications for phenotypic variance and resulting evolutionary trajectories. Among yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, extensive differences have been observed in various species relative to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but mitochondrial genome sampling across many groups has been scarce, even as hundreds of nuclear genomes have become available. By extracting mitochondrial assemblies from existing short-read genome sequence datasets, we have greatly expanded both the number of available genomes and the coverage across sparsely sampled clades. Comparison of 353 yeast mitochondrial genomes revealed that, while size and GC content were fairly consistent across species, those in the genera Metschnikowia and Saccharomyces trended larger, while several species in the order Saccharomycetales, which includes S. cerevisiae, exhibited lower GC content. Extreme examples for both size and GC content were scattered throughout the subphylum. All mitochondrial genomes shared a core set of protein-coding genes for Complexes III, IV, and V, but they varied in the presence or absence of mitochondrially-encoded canonical Complex I genes. We traced the loss of Complex I genes to a major event in the ancestor of the orders Saccharomycetales and Saccharomycodales, but we also observed several independent losses in the orders Phaffomycetales, Pichiales, and Dipodascales. In contrast to prior hypotheses based on smaller-scale datasets, comparison of evolutionary rates in protein-coding genes showed no bias towards elevated rates among aerobically fermenting (Crabtree/Warburg-positive) yeasts. Mitochondrial introns were widely distributed, but they were highly enriched in some groups. The majority of mitochondrial introns were poorly conserved within groups, but several were shared within groups, between groups, and even across taxonomic orders, which is consistent with horizontal gene transfer, likely involving homing endonucleases acting as selfish elements. As the number of available fungal nuclear genomes continues to expand, the methods described here to retrieve mitochondrial genome sequences from these datasets will prove invaluable to ensuring that studies of fungal mitochondrial genomes keep pace with their nuclear counterparts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">An understanding of genetic differences between populations is essential for avoiding confounding in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and understanding the evolution of human traits. Polygenic risk scores constructed in one group perform poorly in highly genetically-differentiated populations, for reasons which remain controversial. We developed a statistical ancestry inference pipeline able to decompose ancestry both within and between countries, and applied it to the UK Biobank data. This identifies fine-scale patterns of genetic relatedness not captured by standard and widely used principal components (PCs), and allows fine-scale population stratification correction that removes both false positive and false negative associations for traits with geographic correlations. We also develop and apply ANCHOR, an approach leveraging segments of distinct ancestries within individuals to estimate similarity in underlying causal effect sizes between groups, using an existing PGS. Applying ANCHOR to &gt;8000 people of mixed African and European ancestry, we demonstrate that estimated causal effect sizes are highly similar across these ancestries for 26 of 29 quantitative molecular and non-molecular phenotypes (mean correlation 0.98 &#43;/-0.08), providing evidence that gene-environment and gene-gene interactions do not play major roles in the poor prediction of European-ancestry PRS scores in African populations for these traits, contradicting previous findings. Instead our results provide optimism that shared causal mutations operate similarly in different groups, focussing the challenge of improving GWAS &#34;portability&#34; between groups on joint fine-mapping.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many proteins remain poorly characterized even in well-studied organisms, presenting a bottleneck for research. We applied phenomics and machine-learning approaches with Schizosaccharomyces pombe for broad cues on protein functions. We assayed colony-growth phenotypes to measure the fitness of deletion mutants for 3509 non-essential genes in 131 conditions with different nutrients, drugs, and stresses. These analyses exposed phenotypes for 3492 mutants, including 124 mutants of  priority unstudied proteins conserved in humans, providing varied functional clues. For example, over 900 proteins were newly implicated in the resistance to oxidative stress. Phenotype-correlation networks suggested roles for poorly characterized proteins through  guilt by association with known proteins. For complementary functional insights, we predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms using machine learning methods exploiting protein-network and protein-homology data (NET-FF). We obtained 56,594 high-scoring GO predictions, of which 22,060 also featured high information content. Our phenotype-correlation data and NET-FF predictions showed a strong concordance with existing PomBase GO annotations and protein networks, with integrated analyses revealing 1,675 novel GO predictions for 783 genes, including 47 predictions for 23 priority unstudied proteins. Experimental validation identified new proteins involved in cellular ageing, showing that these predictions and phenomics data provide a rich resource to uncover new protein functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transcriptional enhancers control spatiotemporal gene expression and commonly engage in long-range chromosomal contacts with gene promoters. However, the relationship between enhancer activity, enhancer-promoter contact and gene expression is not completely understood. Here, we leverage human genetic variation as a &#34;natural perturbation&#34; to dissect this relationship. Focusing on enhancers that harbour genetic variants showing allelic associations with the expression levels of distal genes (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs), we profiled eQTL-promoter contacts using high-resolution Capture Hi-C, as well as chromatin activity by ATAC-sequencing, in primary monocytes isolated from 34 healthy donors. To detect the associations of genetic variants with these molecular phenotypes, we extended a recently proposed Bayesian method that leverages both intra- and interindividual variation. We identified 19 eQTLs associated with differential promoter contacts, most of which also showed an association with chromatin activity. Capitalising on this overlap, we next adapted a Bayesian mapping strategy for detecting variants that exert genetic control across multiple phenotypes, revealing hundreds of putative &#34;trimodal QTL&#34; variants jointly associated with enhancer activity, connectivity, and gene expression. A subset of these variants was predicted to affect the binding of a diverse range of transcription factors, in part through disruption of the binding motifs for either these factors or their binding partners. In addition, we identified a variant with opposite effects on promoter contact and expression levels of its target gene, PCK2. We show that this variant disrupts the canonical binding motif of the architectural protein CTCF and likely perturbs the chromatin insulation of the PCK2 promoter from more distal enhancers. Finally, multiple identified QTLs overlapped known disease susceptibility loci, pointing to the potential role of enhancer-promoter communication in mediating the pathological effects of non-coding genetic variation. Jointly, our findings suggest an inherent functional link between the activity and connectivity of enhancers with relevance for human disease and highlight the role of genetically-determined chromatin boundaries in gene expression control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetic targeting (e.g., gene knockout and tagging) based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a simple yet powerful approach for studying gene functions. Although it was originally developed in classic budding and fission yeast models, the same principle equally applies to other eukaryotic systems with efficient homologous recombination. One-step-PCR-based genetic targeting is more conventionally used but the sizes of the homologous arms that it generates for recombination-mediated genetic targeting are usually limited. Alternatively, gene targeting can also be performed via fusion PCR, which can create homologous arms that are orders of magnitude larger, therefore substantially increases the efficiency of recombination-mediated genetic targeting. Here we present GetPrimers (https://www.evomicslab.org/app/getprimers/), a generalized computational framework and web tool to assist automatic targeting and verification primer design for both one-step-PCR-based and fusion-PCR-based genetic targeting experiments. Moreover, GetPrimers by design runs for any given species of any genetic background, with full genome scalability. Therefore, GetPrimers is capable of empowering high-throughput functional genomics assays at multi-population and multi-species levels. Comprehensive experimental validations have been performed for the targeting and verification primers designed by GetPrimers across multiple organism systems and experimental setups. We anticipate GetPrimers to become a highly useful and popular tool to facilitate the easy and standardized gene modification across multiple systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations sgshS387Lfs, nagluA603Efs and hgsnatG577Sfsin the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human SGSH, NAGLU, and HGSNAT that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafishs extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent advances in insect genetic engineering offer alternative genetic biocontrol solutions to control populations of pests and disease vectors. While success has been achieved, sex-sorting remains problematic for scaling many genetic biocontrol interventions. Here we describe the development of a sex-sorting technique for female and male selection with a proof-of-concept in D. melanogaster termed SEPARATOR (Sexing Element Produced by Alternative RNA-splicing of A Transgenic Observable Reporter). This approach utilizes dominant fluorescent proteins and differentially spliced introns to ensure sex-specific expression. The system has the potential for adaptability to various insect species and application for high-throughput insect sex-sorting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evolution of postzygotic isolation is thought to be a key step in maintaining species boundaries upon secondary contact. Yet the dynamics and persistence of hybrid incompatibilities in naturally hybridizing species is not well understood. Here, we explore these issues with genetic mapping in three independent populations of recombinant inbred lines between naturally hybridizing monkeyflowers Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus from the sympatric Catherine Creek population. We discovered that the three M. guttatus founders differ dramatically in admixture history, with nearly a quarter of one founders genome introgressed from M. nasutus. Comparative genetic mapping in the three RIL populations revealed three new putative inversions, each one segregating among the M. guttatus founders, two due to admixture. We also found strong, genome-wide transmission ratio distortion in all RILs, but patterns were highly variable among the three populations. At least some of this distortion appears to be explained by epistatic selection favoring parental genotypes, but tests of inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium also revealed multiple candidate Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. We also mapped several genetic loci for hybrid pollen viability, including two interacting pairs that coincide with peaks of distortion. Remarkably, even with this limited sample of three M. guttatus lines, we discovered abundant segregating variation for hybrid incompatibilities with M. nasutus, suggesting this population harbors diverse contributors to postzygotic isolation. Moreover, even with substantial admixture, hybrid incompatibilities between Mimulus species persist, suggesting postzygotic isolation might be a potent force in maintaining species barriers in this system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite a relatively low mutation rate, the large number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has allowed for substantial genetic change, leading to a multitude of emerging variants. Using a recently determined mutation rate (per site replication), as well as parameter estimates for within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection, we apply a stochastic transmission-bottleneck model to describe the survival probability of de novo SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For narrow bottlenecks, we find mutations affecting pertarget-cell attachment rate (with phenotypes associated with fusogenicity and ACE2 binding), have similar transmission probabilities to mutations affecting viral load clearance (with phenotypes associated with humoral evasion). We further find that mutations affecting the eclipse rate (with phenotypes associated with reorganization of cellular metabolic processes and synthesis of viral budding precursor material) are highly favoured relative to all other traits examined. We find mutations leading to reduced removal rates of infected cells (with phenotypes associated with innate immune evasion) have limited transmission advantage relative to mutations leading to humoral evasion. Predicted transmission probabilities, however, for mutations affecting innate immune evasion are more consistent with the range of clinically-estimated household transmission probabilities for de novo mutations. This result suggests that although mutations affecting humoral evasion are more easily transmitted when they occur, mutations affecting innate immune evasion may occur more readily. We examine our predictions in the context of a number of previously characterized mutations in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Our work offers both a null model for SARS-CoV-2 substitution rates and predicts which aspects of viral life history are most likely to successfully evolve, despite low mutation rates and repeated transmission bottlenecks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vitamin C (vitC) enhances the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including TET enzymes, which catalyse DNA demethylation, and Jumonji-domain histone demethylases. The epigenetic remodelling promoted by vitC improves the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell derivation, and is required to attain a ground-state of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that closely mimics the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst. However, genome-wide DNA and histone demethylation can lead to upregulation of transposable elements (TEs), and it is not known how vitC addition in culture media affects TE expression in pluripotent stem cells. Here we show that vitC increases the expression of evolutionarily young LINE-1 (L1) elements in mouse ESCs. We find that TET activity is dispensable for these effects, and that instead L1 upregulation occurs largely as a result of H3K9me3 loss mediated by KDM4A/C histone demethylases. Despite increased L1 levels, we did not detect increased somatic insertion rates in vitC-treated cells. Notably, treatment of human ESCs with vitC also increases L1 protein levels, which could impact the genetic and epigenetic stability of human pluripotent stem cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eukaryotic life depends on the functional elements encoded by both the nuclear genome and organellar genomes, such as those contained within the mitochondria. The content, size, and structure of the mitochondrial genome varies across organisms with potentially large implications for phenotypic variance and resulting evolutionary trajectories. Among yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, extensive differences have been observed in various species relative to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but mitochondrial genome sampling across many groups has been scarce, even as hundreds of nuclear genomes have become available. By extracting mitochondrial assemblies from existing short-read genome sequence datasets, we have greatly expanded both the number of available genomes and the coverage across sparsely sampled clades. Comparison of 353 yeast mitochondrial genomes revealed that, while size and GC content were fairly consistent across species, those in the genera Metschnikowia and Saccharomyces trended larger, while several species in the order Saccharomycetales, which includes S. cerevisiae, exhibited lower GC content. Extreme examples for both size and GC content were scattered throughout the subphylum. All mitochondrial genomes shared a core set of protein-coding genes for Complexes III, IV, and V, but they varied in the presence or absence of mitochondrially-encoded canonical Complex I genes. We traced the loss of Complex I genes to a major event in the ancestor of the orders Saccharomycetales and Saccharomycodales, but we also observed several independent losses in the orders Phaffomycetales, Pichiales, and Dipodascales. In contrast to prior hypotheses based on smaller-scale datasets, comparison of evolutionary rates in protein-coding genes showed no bias towards elevated rates among aerobically fermenting (Crabtree/Warburg-positive) yeasts. Mitochondrial introns were widely distributed, but they were highly enriched in some groups. The majority of mitochondrial introns were poorly conserved within groups, but several were shared within groups, between groups, and even across taxonomic orders, which is consistent with horizontal gene transfer, likely involving homing endonucleases acting as selfish elements. As the number of available fungal nuclear genomes continues to expand, the methods described here to retrieve mitochondrial genome sequences from these datasets will prove invaluable to ensuring that studies of fungal mitochondrial genomes keep pace with their nuclear counterparts.</p>
