H.\nScore: 110.7, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569447\nTransposon-encoded tnpB genes encode RNA-guided DNA nucleases that promote their own selfish spread through targeted DNA cleavage and homologous recombination1-4. This widespread gene family was repeatedly domesticated over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas125,6. We set out to test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, unexpected functions other than CRIS-PR-Cas. Here, using phylogenetics, structural predictions, comparative genomics, and functional assays, we uncover multiple instances of programmable transcription factors that we name TnpB-like nuclease-dead repressors (TldR). These proteins employ naturally occurring guide RNAs to specifically target conserved promoter regions of the genome, leading to potent gene repression in a mechanism akin to CRISPRi technologies invented by humans7. Focusing on a TldR clade found broadly in Enterobacteriaceae, we discover that bacteriophages exploit the combined action of TldR and an adjacently encoded phage gene to alter the expression and composition of the host flagellar assembly, a transformation with the potential to impact motility8, phage susceptibility9, and host immunity10. Col-lectively, this work showcases the diverse molecular innovations that were enabled through repeated exaptation of genes encoded by transposable elements, and reveals that RNA-guided transcription factors emerged long before the development of dCas9-based editors.\nRegulators of health and lifespan extension in genetically diverse mice on dietary restriction\nAuthors: Di Francesco, A.; Deighan, A. G.; Litichevskiy, L.; Chen, Z.; Luciano, A.; Robinson, L.; Garland, G.; Donato, H.; Schott, W.; Wright, K. M.; Raj, A.; Prateek, G. V.; Mullis, M.; Hill, W.; Zediel, M.; Peters, L.; Harding, F.; Botstein, D.; Korstanje, R.; Thaiss, C.; Freund, A.; Churchill, G. A.\nScore: 43.0, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568901\nCaloric restriction (CR) delays aging and extends healthy lifespan in multiple species. Alternative forms of dietary restriction (DR) such as intermittent fasting (IF) have drawn significant interest as a more sustainable regimen, but the landscape of longevity-promoting dietary interventions remains largely unexplored. Identifying the most robust, efficacious, and experimentally tractable modes of DR is key to better understanding and implementing effective longevity interventions for human healthspan. To that end, we have performed an extensive assessment of DR interventions, investigating the effects of graded levels of CR (20% and 40%) and IF (1 day and 2 days of fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. All interventions extended lifespan, although only CR significantly reduced the mortality doubling time. Notably, IF did not extend lifespan in mice with high pre-intervention bodyweight. We carried out extensive phenotyping to determine the health effects of long-term DR and to better understand the mechanisms driving within-diet heterogeneity in lifespan. The top within-diet predictor of lifespan was the ability of mice to maintain bodyweight through periods of handling, an indicator of stress resilience. Additional predictors of long lifespan include specific changes in immune cells, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and retention of adiposity in late life. We found that lifespan is heritable (h2 = 0.24), and that genetic background has a larger influence on lifespan than dietary interventions. We identified a significant association for lifespan and RDW on chromosome 18 that explained 4.3% of the diet-adjusted variation in lifespan. Diet-induced changes on metabolic traits, although beneficial, were relatively poor predictors of lifespan, arguing against the long-standing notion that DR works by counteracting the negative effects of obesity. These findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and that metabolic parameters may be inappropriate endpoints for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials.\nMechanism of homology search expansion during recombinational DNA break repair\nAuthors: Dumont, A.; Mendiboure, N.; Savocco, J.; Anani, L.; Moreau, P.; Thierry, A.; Modolo, L.; Jost, D.; Piazza, A.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569403\nHomology search catalyzed by a RecA/Rad51 nucleoprotein filament (NPF) is a central step of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination. How it operates in cells remains elusive. Here we developed a Hi-C-based methodology to map single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) contacts genome-wide in S. cerevisiae, which revealed two main homology search phases. Initial search conducted by short NPFs is confined in cis by cohesin-mediated chromatin loop folding. Progressive growth of stiff NPFs enables exploration of distant genomic sites. Long-range resection by Exo1 drives this transition from local to genome-wide search by providing ssDNA substrates for assembly of extensive NPFs. DSB end-tethering promotes coordinated homology search by NPFs formed on the two DSB ends. Finally, an autonomous genetic element on chromosome III engages the NPF and stimulates homology search in its vicinity. This work reveals the mechanism of the progressive and uneven expansion of homology search orchestrated by chromatin organizers, long-range resection, end-tethering, specialized genetic elements, and that exploits the stiff NPF structure conferred by Rad51 oligomerization. Highlights- Cohesin-mediated chromatin loops constrain homology search in cis for NPF regions close to the resection front - Stiffening of ssDNA by Rad51 enables genome-wide homology search by DSB-proximal sites - Exo1-mediated long-range resection promotes genome-wide homology search - DSB end-tethering promotes coordinated homology search by NPFs formed on both DSB ends - The recombination enhancer focuses homology search in its vicinity\nWhole genome association testing in 333,100 individuals across three biobanks identifies rare non-coding single variant and genomic aggregate associations with height\nAuthors: Hawkes, G.; Beaumont, R.

R.; Zhou, H.; NH\nScore: 46.9, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.566520\nThe role of rare non-coding variation in complex human phenotypes is still largely unknown. To elucidate the impact of rare variants in regulatory elements, we performed a whole-genome sequencing association analysis for height using 333,100 individuals from three datasets: UK Biobank (N=200,003), TOPMed (N=87,652) and All of Us (N=45,445). We performed rare (\u003c0.1% minor-allele-frequency) single-variant and aggregate testing of non-coding variants in regulatory regions based on proximal, intergenic and deep-intronic annotation. We observed 29 independent variants associated with height at P \u003c 6 x 10-10 after conditioning on previously reported variants, with effect sizes ranging from -7cm to +4.7cm. We also identified and replicated non-coding aggregate-based associations proximal to HMGA1 containing variants associated with a 5cm taller height and of highly-conserved variants in MIR497HG on chromosome 17. We have developed a novel approach for identifying non-coding rare variants in regulatory regions with large effects from whole-genome sequencing data associated with complex traits.\nSomatic Mosaicism in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia Reveals Widespread Degeneration from Focal Mutations\nAuthors: Zhou, Z.; Kim, J.; Huang, A. Y.; Nolan, M.; Park, J.; Doan, R.; Shin, T.; Miller, M. B.; Chhouk, B.; Morillo, K.; Yeh, R. C.; Kenny, C.; Neil, J. E.; Lee, C.-Z.; Ohkubo, T.; Ravits, J.; Ansorge, O.; Ostrow, L. W.; Lagier-Tourenne, C.; Lee, E. A.; Walsh, C. A.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569436\nAlthough mutations in dozens of genes have been implicated in familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (fFTD), most cases of these conditions are sporadic (sALS and sFTD), with no family history, and their etiology remains obscure. We tested the hypothesis that somatic mosaic mutations, present in some but not all cells, might contribute in these cases, by performing ultra-deep, targeted sequencing of 88 genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases in postmortem brain and spinal cord samples from 404 individuals with sALS or sFTD and 144 controls. Known pathogenic germline mutations were found in 20.6% of ALS, and 26.5% of FTD cases. Predicted pathogenic somatic mutations in ALS/FTD genes were observed in 2.7% of sALS and sFTD cases that did not carry known pathogenic or novel germline mutations. Somatic mutations showed low variant allele fraction (typically \u003c2%) and were often restricted to the region of initial discovery, preventing detection through genetic screening in peripheral tissues. Damaging somatic mutations were preferentially enriched in primary motor cortex of sALS and prefrontal cortex of sFTD, mirroring regions most severely affected in each disease. Somatic mutation analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from brain and spinal cord from an additional 143 sALS cases and 23 controls confirmed an overall enrichment of somatic mutations in sALS. Two adult sALS cases were identified bearing pathogenic somatic mutations in DYNC1H1 and LMNA, two genes associated with pediatric motor neuron degeneration. Our study suggests that somatic mutations in fALS/fFTD genes, and in genes associated with more severe diseases in the germline state, contribute to sALS and sFTD, and that mosaic mutations in a small fraction of cells in focal regions of the nervous system can ultimately result in widespread degeneration.\nNon-coding rare variant associations with blood traits on 166,740 UK Biobank genomes\nAuthors: Ribeiro, D.; Delaneau, O.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569422\nLarge biobanks with whole-genome sequencing now enable the association of non-coding rare variants with complex human traits. Given that \u003e98% of the genome is available for exploration, the selection of non-coding variants remains a critical yet unresolved challenge in these analyses. Here, we leverage knowledge of blood gene regulation and deleteriousness scores to select non-coding variants pertinent for association with blood-related traits. We leverage whole genome sequencing and 59 blood cell count and biomarker measurements for 166 740 UK Biobank samples to perform variant collapsing tests. We identified hundreds of gene-trait associations involving non-coding variants across the 59 traits. However, we demonstrate that the majority of these non-coding rare variant associations (i) reproduce associations known from common variant studies and (ii) are driven by linkage disequilibrium between nearby common and rare variants. This study underscores the prevailing challenges in rare variant analysis and the need for caution when interpreting non-coding rare variant association results.\nDigital telomere measurement by long-read sequencing distinguishes healthy aging from disease\nAuthors: Sanchez, S. E.; Gu, J.; Golla, A.; Martin, A.; Shomali, W.; Hockemeyer, D.; Savage, S.; Artandi, S.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569263\nTelomere length is an important biomarker of organismal aging and cellular replicative potential, but existing measurement methods are limited in resolution and accuracy. Here, we deploy digital telomere measurement by nanopore sequencing to understand how distributions of human telomere length change with age and disease. We measure telomere attrition and de novo elongation with unprecedented resolution in genetically defined populations of human cells, in blood cells from healthy donors and in blood cells from patients with genetic defects in telomere maintenance. We find that human aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of long telomeres and an accumulation of shorter telomeres. In patients with defects in telomere maintenance, the accumulation of short telomeres is more pronounced and correlates with phenotypic severity. We apply machine learning to train a binary classification model that distinguishes healthy individuals from those with telomere biology disorders. This sequencing and bioinformatic pipeline will advance our understanding of telomere maintenance mechanisms and the use of telomere length as a clinical biomarker of aging and disease.\nAberrant expression prediction across human tissues\nAuthors: Hölzlwimmer, F. R.; Lindner, J.; Wagner, N.; Yepez, V. A.; Casale, F. P.; Gagneur, J.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569414\nDespite the frequent implication of aberrant gene expression in diseases, algorithms predicting aberrantly expressed genes of an individual are lacking. To address this need, we compiled an aberrant expression prediction benchmark covering 8.2 million rare variants from 633 individuals across 48 tissues. While not geared toward aberrant expression, the deleteriousness score CADD and the loss-of-function predictor LOFTEE showed mild predictive ability (1-1.5% average precision). Leveraging these and further variant annotations, we next trained AbExp, a model that yielded 10% average precision by combining in a tissue-specific fashion expression variability with variant effects on isoforms and on aberrant splicing. Integrating expression measurements from clinically accessible tissues led to another two-fold improvement. Furthermore, we show on UK Biobank blood traits that performing rare variant association testing using the continuous and tissue-specific AbExp variant scores instead of LOFTEE variant burden increases gene discovery sensitivity and enables improved phenotype predictions.\nThe evolution and convergence of mutation spectra across mammals\nAuthors: Talenti, A.; Wilkinson, T.; Morrison, L. J.; Prendergast, J. G.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.02.569698\nDespite the key role genetic mutations play in shaping phenotypic differences between species, little is currently known about the evolution of germline mutation spectra across mammals. Domesticated species are likely particularly interesting case studies because of their high mutation rates and complex evolutionary histories, which can span multiple founding events and genetic bottlenecks. Here we have developed a new reusable workflow, nSPECTRa, that can undertake the key steps in characterising mutation spectra, from determining ancestral alleles to characterising multiple forms of variation. We apply nSPECTRa to seven species, including several that have undergone domestication, and highlight how nSPECTRa can provide important novel insights into mutation rate evolution. While mutation spectra most often show marked differences between species and even breeds, certain mutation types have risen to a high frequency in subpopulations of different species, indicative of convergent evolution in mutation rates. This includes the previously characterized TCC-\u003eTTC change enriched among European humans, which is also enriched among East Asian cattle. We show Indicine cattle are particularly interesting examples of how different mutation spectra segregate within a population and subsequently spread across the globe. Together, this work has important implications for understanding the control and evolution of mammalian mutation rates.\nThe C. elegans Myc-family of transcription factors coordinate a dynamic adaptive response to dietary restriction.\nAuthors: Cornwell, A. B.; Zhang, Y.; Thondamal, M.; Johnson, D. W.; Thakar, J.; Samuelson, A. V.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568222\nDietary restriction (DR), the process of decreasing overall food consumption over an extended period of time, has been shown to increase longevity across evolutionarily diverse species and delay the onset of age-associated diseases in humans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Myc-family transcription factors (TFs) MXL-2 (Mlx) and MML-1 (MondoA/ChREBP), which function as obligate heterodimers, and PHA-4 (orthologous to forkhead box transcription factor A) are both necessary for the full physiological benefits of DR. However, the adaptive transcriptional response to DR and the role of MML-1::MXL-2 and PHA-4 remains elusive. We identified the transcriptional signature of C. elegans DR, using the eat-2 genetic model, and demonstrate broad changes in metabolic gene expression in eat-2 DR animals, which requires both mxl-2 and pha-4. While the requirement for these factors in DR gene expression overlaps, we found many of the DR genes exhibit an opposing change in relative gene expression in eat-2;mxl-2 animals compared to wild-type, which was not observed in eat-2 animals with pha-4 loss. We further show functional deficiencies of the mxl-2 loss in DR outside of lifespan, as eat-2;mxl-2 animals exhibit substantially smaller brood sizes and lay a proportion of dead eggs, indicating that MML-1::MXL-2 has a role in maintaining the balance between resource allocation to the soma and to reproduction under conditions of chronic food scarcity. While eat-2 animals do not show a significantly different metabolic rate compared to wild-type, we also find that loss of mxl-2 in DR does not affect the rate of oxygen consumption in young animals. The gene expression signature of eat-2 mutant animals is consistent with optimization of energy utilization and resource allocation, rather than induction of canonical gene expression changes associated with acute metabolic stress -such as induction of autophagy after TORC1 inhibition. Consistently, eat-2 animals are not substantially resistant to stress, providing further support to the idea that chronic DR may benefit healthspan and lifespan through efficient use of limited resources rather than broad upregulation of stress responses, and also indicates that MML-1::MXL-2 and PHA-4 may have different roles in promotion of benefits in response to different pro-longevity stimuli.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Transposon-encoded tnpB genes encode RNA-guided DNA nucleases that promote their own selfish spread through targeted DNA cleavage and homologous recombination1-4. This widespread gene family was repeatedly domesticated over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas125,6. We set out to test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, unexpected functions other than CRIS-PR-Cas. Here, using phylogenetics, structural predictions, comparative genomics, and functional assays, we uncover multiple instances of programmable transcription factors that we name TnpB-like nuclease-dead repressors (TldR). These proteins employ naturally occurring guide RNAs to specifically target conserved promoter regions of the genome, leading to potent gene repression in a mechanism akin to CRISPRi technologies invented by humans7. Focusing on a TldR clade found broadly in Enterobacteriaceae, we discover that bacteriophages exploit the combined action of TldR and an adjacently encoded phage gene to alter the expression and composition of the host flagellar assembly, a transformation with the potential to impact motility8, phage susceptibility9, and host immunity10. Col-lectively, this work showcases the diverse molecular innovations that were enabled through repeated exaptation of genes encoded by transposable elements, and reveals that RNA-guided transcription factors emerged long before the development of dCas9-based editors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Caloric restriction (CR) delays aging and extends healthy lifespan in multiple species. Alternative forms of dietary restriction (DR) such as intermittent fasting (IF) have drawn significant interest as a more sustainable regimen, but the landscape of longevity-promoting dietary interventions remains largely unexplored. Identifying the most robust, efficacious, and experimentally tractable modes of DR is key to better understanding and implementing effective longevity interventions for human healthspan. To that end, we have performed an extensive assessment of DR interventions, investigating the effects of graded levels of CR (20% and 40%) and IF (1 day and 2 days of fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. All interventions extended lifespan, although only CR significantly reduced the mortality doubling time. Notably, IF did not extend lifespan in mice with high pre-intervention bodyweight. We carried out extensive phenotyping to determine the health effects of long-term DR and to better understand the mechanisms driving within-diet heterogeneity in lifespan. The top within-diet predictor of lifespan was the ability of mice to maintain bodyweight through periods of handling, an indicator of stress resilience. Additional predictors of long lifespan include specific changes in immune cells, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and retention of adiposity in late life. We found that lifespan is heritable (h2 = 0.24), and that genetic background has a larger influence on lifespan than dietary interventions. We identified a significant association for lifespan and RDW on chromosome 18 that explained 4.3% of the diet-adjusted variation in lifespan. Diet-induced changes on metabolic traits, although beneficial, were relatively poor predictors of lifespan, arguing against the long-standing notion that DR works by counteracting the negative effects of obesity. These findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and that metabolic parameters may be inappropriate endpoints for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Homology search catalyzed by a RecA/Rad51 nucleoprotein filament (NPF) is a central step of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination. How it operates in cells remains elusive. Here we developed a Hi-C-based methodology to map single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) contacts genome-wide in S. cerevisiae, which revealed two main homology search phases. Initial search conducted by short NPFs is confined in cis by cohesin-mediated chromatin loop folding. Progressive growth of stiff NPFs enables exploration of distant genomic sites. Long-range resection by Exo1 drives this transition from local to genome-wide search by providing ssDNA substrates for assembly of extensive NPFs. DSB end-tethering promotes coordinated homology search by NPFs formed on the two DSB ends. Finally, an autonomous genetic element on chromosome III engages the NPF and stimulates homology search in its vicinity. This work reveals the mechanism of the progressive and uneven expansion of homology search orchestrated by chromatin organizers, long-range resection, end-tethering, specialized genetic elements, and that exploits the stiff NPF structure conferred by Rad51 oligomerization.

Highlights- Cohesin-mediated chromatin loops constrain homology search in cis for NPF regions close to the resection front
- Stiffening of ssDNA by Rad51 enables genome-wide homology search by DSB-proximal sites
- Exo1-mediated long-range resection promotes genome-wide homology search
- DSB end-tethering promotes coordinated homology search by NPFs formed on both DSB ends
- The recombination enhancer focuses homology search in its vicinity</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of rare non-coding variation in complex human phenotypes is still largely unknown. To elucidate the impact of rare variants in regulatory elements, we performed a whole-genome sequencing association analysis for height using 333,100 individuals from three datasets: UK Biobank (N=200,003), TOPMed (N=87,652) and All of Us (N=45,445). We performed rare (&lt;0.1% minor-allele-frequency) single-variant and aggregate testing of non-coding variants in regulatory regions based on proximal, intergenic and deep-intronic annotation. We observed 29 independent variants associated with height at P &lt; 6 x 10-10 after conditioning on previously reported variants, with effect sizes ranging from -7cm to &#43;4.7cm. We also identified and replicated non-coding aggregate-based associations proximal to HMGA1 containing variants associated with a 5cm taller height and of highly-conserved variants in MIR497HG on chromosome 17. We have developed a novel approach for identifying non-coding rare variants in regulatory regions with large effects from whole-genome sequencing data associated with complex traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although mutations in dozens of genes have been implicated in familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (fFTD), most cases of these conditions are sporadic (sALS and sFTD), with no family history, and their etiology remains obscure. We tested the hypothesis that somatic mosaic mutations, present in some but not all cells, might contribute in these cases, by performing ultra-deep, targeted sequencing of 88 genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases in postmortem brain and spinal cord samples from 404 individuals with sALS or sFTD and 144 controls. Known pathogenic germline mutations were found in 20.6% of ALS, and 26.5% of FTD cases. Predicted pathogenic somatic mutations in ALS/FTD genes were observed in 2.7% of sALS and sFTD cases that did not carry known pathogenic or novel germline mutations. Somatic mutations showed low variant allele fraction (typically &lt;2%) and were often restricted to the region of initial discovery, preventing detection through genetic screening in peripheral tissues. Damaging somatic mutations were preferentially enriched in primary motor cortex of sALS and prefrontal cortex of sFTD, mirroring regions most severely affected in each disease. Somatic mutation analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from brain and spinal cord from an additional 143 sALS cases and 23 controls confirmed an overall enrichment of somatic mutations in sALS. Two adult sALS cases were identified bearing pathogenic somatic mutations in DYNC1H1 and LMNA, two genes associated with pediatric motor neuron degeneration. Our study suggests that somatic mutations in fALS/fFTD genes, and in genes associated with more severe diseases in the germline state, contribute to sALS and sFTD, and that mosaic mutations in a small fraction of cells in focal regions of the nervous system can ultimately result in widespread degeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large biobanks with whole-genome sequencing now enable the association of non-coding rare variants with complex human traits. Given that &gt;98% of the genome is available for exploration, the selection of non-coding variants remains a critical yet unresolved challenge in these analyses. Here, we leverage knowledge of blood gene regulation and deleteriousness scores to select non-coding variants pertinent for association with blood-related traits. We leverage whole genome sequencing and 59 blood cell count and biomarker measurements for 166 740 UK Biobank samples to perform variant collapsing tests. We identified hundreds of gene-trait associations involving non-coding variants across the 59 traits. However, we demonstrate that the majority of these non-coding rare variant associations (i) reproduce associations known from common variant studies and (ii) are driven by linkage disequilibrium between nearby common and rare variants. This study underscores the prevailing challenges in rare variant analysis and the need for caution when interpreting non-coding rare variant association results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Telomere length is an important biomarker of organismal aging and cellular replicative potential, but existing measurement methods are limited in resolution and accuracy. Here, we deploy digital telomere measurement by nanopore sequencing to understand how distributions of human telomere length change with age and disease. We measure telomere attrition and de novo elongation with unprecedented resolution in genetically defined populations of human cells, in blood cells from healthy donors and in blood cells from patients with genetic defects in telomere maintenance. We find that human aging is accompanied by a progressive loss of long telomeres and an accumulation of shorter telomeres. In patients with defects in telomere maintenance, the accumulation of short telomeres is more pronounced and correlates with phenotypic severity. We apply machine learning to train a binary classification model that distinguishes healthy individuals from those with telomere biology disorders. This sequencing and bioinformatic pipeline will advance our understanding of telomere maintenance mechanisms and the use of telomere length as a clinical biomarker of aging and disease.</p>

To address this need, we compiled an aberrant expression prediction benchmark covering 8.2 million rare variants from 633 individuals across 48 tissues. While not geared toward aberrant expression, the deleteriousness score CADD and the loss-of-function predictor LOFTEE showed mild predictive ability (1-1.5% average precision). Leveraging these and further variant annotations, we next trained AbExp, a model that yielded 10% average precision by combining in a tissue-specific fashion expression variability with variant effects on isoforms and on aberrant splicing. Integrating expression measurements from clinically accessible tissues led to another two-fold improvement. Furthermore, we show on UK Biobank blood traits that performing rare variant association testing using the continuous and tissue-specific AbExp variant scores instead of LOFTEE variant burden increases gene discovery sensitivity and enables improved phenotype predictions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the key role genetic mutations play in shaping phenotypic differences between species, little is currently known about the evolution of germline mutation spectra across mammals. Domesticated species are likely particularly interesting case studies because of their high mutation rates and complex evolutionary histories, which can span multiple founding events and genetic bottlenecks. Here we have developed a new reusable workflow, nSPECTRa, that can undertake the key steps in characterising mutation spectra, from determining ancestral alleles to characterising multiple forms of variation. We apply nSPECTRa to seven species, including several that have undergone domestication, and highlight how nSPECTRa can provide important novel insights into mutation rate evolution. While mutation spectra most often show marked differences between species and even breeds, certain mutation types have risen to a high frequency in subpopulations of different species, indicative of convergent evolution in mutation rates. This includes the previously characterized TCC-&gt;TTC change enriched among European humans, which is also enriched among East Asian cattle. We show Indicine cattle are particularly interesting examples of how different mutation spectra segregate within a population and subsequently spread across the globe. Together, this work has important implications for understanding the control and evolution of mammalian mutation rates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary restriction (DR), the process of decreasing overall food consumption over an extended period of time, has been shown to increase longevity across evolutionarily diverse species and delay the onset of age-associated diseases in humans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Myc-family transcription factors (TFs) MXL-2 (Mlx) and MML-1 (MondoA/ChREBP), which function as obligate heterodimers, and PHA-4 (orthologous to forkhead box transcription factor A) are both necessary for the full physiological benefits of DR. However, the adaptive transcriptional response to DR and the role of MML-1::MXL-2 and PHA-4 remains elusive. We identified the transcriptional signature of C. elegans DR, using the eat-2 genetic model, and demonstrate broad changes in metabolic gene expression in eat-2 DR animals, which requires both mxl-2 and pha-4. While the requirement for these factors in DR gene expression overlaps, we found many of the DR genes exhibit an opposing change in relative gene expression in eat-2;mxl-2 animals compared to wild-type, which was not observed in eat-2 animals with pha-4 loss. We further show functional deficiencies of the mxl-2 loss in DR outside of lifespan, as eat-2;mxl-2 animals exhibit substantially smaller brood sizes and lay a proportion of dead eggs, indicating that MML-1::MXL-2 has a role in maintaining the balance between resource allocation to the soma and to reproduction under conditions of chronic food scarcity. While eat-2 animals do not show a significantly different metabolic rate compared to wild-type, we also find that loss of mxl-2 in DR does not affect the rate of oxygen consumption in young animals. The gene expression signature of eat-2 mutant animals is consistent with optimization of energy utilization and resource allocation, rather than induction of canonical gene expression changes associated with acute metabolic stress -such as induction of autophagy after TORC1 inhibition. Consistently, eat-2 animals are not substantially resistant to stress, providing further support to the idea that chronic DR may benefit healthspan and lifespan through efficient use of limited resources rather than broad upregulation of stress responses, and also indicates that MML-1::MXL-2 and PHA-4 may have different roles in promotion of benefits in response to different pro-longevity stimuli.</p>
