I.; Alasoo, K.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-09-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560109\nIdentifying causal genes underlying genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a fundamental problem in human genetics. Although colocalisation with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is often used to prioritise GWAS target genes, systematic benchmarking has been limited due to unavailability of large ground truth datasets. Here, we re-analysed plasma protein QTL data from 3,301 individuals of the INTERVAL cohort together with 131 eQTL Catalogue datasets. Focusing on variants located within or close to the affected protein identified 793 proteins with at least one cis-pQTL where we could assume that the most likely causal gene was the gene coding for the protein. We then benchmarked the ability of cis-eQTLs to recover these causal genes by comparing three Bayesian colocalisation methods (coloc.susie, coloc.abf and CLPP) and five Mendelian randomisation (MR) approaches (three varieties of inversevariance weighted MR, MR-RAPS, and MRLocus). We found that assigning fine-mapped pQTLs to their closest protein coding genes outperformed all colocalisation methods regarding both precision (71.9%) and recall (76.9%). Furthermore, the colocalisation method with the highest recall (coloc.susie - 46.3%) also had the lowest precision (45.1%). Combining evidence from multiple conditionally distinct colocalising QTLs with MR increased precision to 81%, but this was accompanied by a large reduction in recall to 7.1%. Furthermore, the choice of the MR method greatly affected performance, with the standard inverse-variance weighted MR often producing many false positives. Our results highlight that linking GWAS variants to target genes remains challenging with eQTL evidence alone, and prioritising novel targets requires triangulation of evidence from multiple sources.\nBronze Age Northern Eurasian Genetics in the Context of Development of Metallurgy and Siberian Ancestry\nAuthors: Childebayeva, A.; Fricke, F.; Rohrlach, A. B.; Huang, L.; Schiffels, S.; Vesakoski, O.; Semerau, L.; Aron, F.; Moiseyev, V.; Khartanovich, V.; Kovtun, I.; Krause, J.; Kuzminykh, S.; Haak, W.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560195\nThe Eurasian Bronze Age (BA) has been described as a period of substantial human migrations, the emergence of pastoralism, horse domestication, and development of metallurgy. This study focuses on individuals associated with BA metallurgical production, specifically the Seima-Turbino (ST) phenomenon ([~]2,200-1,900 BCE) associated with elaborate metal objects found across Northern Eurasia. The genetic profiles of nine ST-associated individuals vary widely ranging between ancestries maximized in individuals from the Eastern Siberian Late Neolithic/BA, and those of the Western Steppe Middle Late BA. The genetic heterogeneity observed is consistent with the current understanding of the ST metallurgical network as a transcultural phenomenon. The new data also shed light on the temporal and spatial range of an ancient Siberian genetic ancestry component, which is shared across many Uralic-speaking populations, and which we explore further via demographic modeling using additional genome-wide (2 individuals) and whole genome data (5 individuals, including a [~]30x genome) from northwestern Russia.\nAdmix-kit: An Integrated Toolkit and Pipeline for Genetic Analyses of Admixed Populations\nAuthors: Hou, K.; Gogarten, S.; Kim, J.; Hua, X.; Dias, J.-A.; Sun, Q.; Wang, Y.; Tan, T.; Polygenic Risk Methods in Diverse Populations (PRIMED) Consortium Methods Working Group, ; Atkinson, E. G.; Martin, A.; Shortt, J.; Hirbo, J.; Li, Y.; Pasaniuc, B.; Zhang, H.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560263\nSummaryAdmixed populations, with their unique and diverse genetic backgrounds, are often underrepresented in genetic studies. This oversight not only limits our understanding but also exacerbates existing health disparities. One major barrier has been the lack of efficient tools tailored for the special challenges of genetic study of admixed populations. Here, we present admix-kit, an integrated toolkit and pipeline for genetic analyses of admixed populations. Admix-kit implements a suite of methods to facilitate genotype and phenotype simulation, association testing, genetic architecture inference, and polygenic scoring in admixed populations. Availability and implementationAdmix-kit package is open-source and available at https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit. Additionally, users can use the pipeline designed for admixed genotype simulation available at https://github.com/UW-GAC/admix-kit_workflow.\nSynchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome, and transcriptome for resolving a Mendelian condition\nAuthors: Vollger, M.

B.\nScore: 37.8, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559521\nResolving the molecular basis of a Mendelian condition (MC) remains challenging owing to the diverse mechanisms by which genetic variants cause disease. To address this, we developed a synchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome, and transcriptome sequencing approach, which enables accurate single-nucleotide, insertion-deletion, and structural variant calling and diploid de novo genome assembly, and permits the simultaneous elucidation of haplotype-resolved CpG methylation, chromatin accessibility, and full-length transcript information in a single long-read sequencing run. Application of this approach to an Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) participant with a chromosome X;13 balanced translocation of uncertain significance revealed that this translocation disrupted the functioning of four separate genes (NBEA, PDK3, MAB21L1, and RB1) previously associated with single-gene MCs. Notably, the function of each gene was disrupted via a distinct mechanism that required integration of the four omes to resolve. These included nonsense-mediated decay, fusion transcript formation, enhancer adoption, transcriptional readthrough silencing, and inappropriate X chromosome inactivation of autosomal genes. Overall, this highlights the utility of synchronized long-read multi-omic profiling for mechanistically resolving complex phenotypes.\nThe overlapping genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders and cortical brain structure\nAuthors: Sha, Z.; Warrier, V.; Bethlehem, R. A. I.; Schultz, L. M.; Merikangas, A. K.; Sun, K. Y.; Gur, R. C.; Gur, R. E.; Shinohara, R. T.; Seidlitz, J.; Almasy, L.; Andreassen, O.; Alexander-Bloch, A.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561040\nBoth psychiatric vulnerability and cortical structure are shaped by the cumulative effect of common genetic variants across the genome. However, the shared genetic underpinnings between psychiatric disorders and brain structural phenotypes, such as thickness and surface area of the cerebral cortex, remains elusive. In this study, we employed pleiotropy-informed conjunctional false discovery rate analysis to investigate shared loci across genome-wide association scans of regional cortical thickness, surface area, and seven psychiatric disorders in approximately 700,000 individuals of European ancestry. Aggregating regional measures, we identified 50 genetic loci shared between psychiatric disorders and surface area, as well as 26 genetic loci shared with cortical thickness. Risk alleles exhibited bidirectional effects on both cortical thickness and surface area, such that some risk alleles for each disorder increased regional brain size while other risk alleles decreased regional brain size. Due to bidirectional effects, in many cases we observed extensive pleiotropy between an imaging phenotype and a psychiatric disorder even in the absence of a significant genetic correlation between them. The impact of genetic risk for psychiatric disorders on regional brain structure did exhibit a consistent pattern across highly comorbid psychiatric disorders, with 80% of the genetic loci shared across multiple disorders displaying consistent directions of effect. Cortical patterning of genetic overlap revealed a hierarchical genetic architecture, with the association cortex and sensorimotor cortex representing two extremes of shared genetic influence on psychiatric disorders and brain structural variation. Integrating multi-scale functional annotations and transcriptomic profiles, we observed that shared genetic loci were enriched in active genomic regions, converged on neurobiological and metabolic pathways, and showed differential expression in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with psychiatric disorders. Cumulatively, these findings provide a significant advance in our understanding of the overlapping polygenic architecture between psychopathology and cortical brain structure.\nNAMERS: a purpose-built reference DNA sequence database to support applied eDNA metabarcoding\nAuthors: Westfall, K. M.; Singer, G. A. C.; Kaushal, M.; Gilmore, S. R.; Fahner, N.; Hajibabaei, M.; Abbott, C. L.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561210\nApplied eDNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate actionable results to inform management decisions, regulations, or policy development. Because of these important downstream considerations, optimizing workflow elements is now essential to increasing standardization, efficiency, and confidence of metabarcoding results. Reference DNA sequences are critical workflow elements that currently lack consistent approaches to generating, curating, or publishing. Here we present a complete (mitochondrial genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron) and high quality reference DNA sequence library for the freshwater fishes of British Columbia, Canada. This resource is published as the Novel Applied eDNA Metabarcoding Reference Sequences (NAMERS) repository (https://namers.ca), a user-friendly and interactive website for specialists and non-specialists alike to explore and generate custom reference libraries for taxa and genes of interest. We demonstrate the power of NAMERS to optimize applied eDNA metabarcoding workflows at the study design stage by analyzing the number of primer mismatches and resolution power of existing metabarcoding markers. To meet the increasing demand for actionable eDNA metabarcoding applications, NAMERS demonstrates that high quality curated genomic information is within a reasonable reach. It is timely to establish this framework as the new gold standard and coordinate our efforts to generate this type of reference data at scale.\nEvolutionary adaptation of the chromodomain of the HP1-protein Rhino allows the integration of chromatin and DNA sequence signals\nAuthors: Baumgartner, L.; Ipsaro, J. J.; Hohmann, U.; Handler, D.; Schleiffer, A.; Duchek, P.; Brennecke, J.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560096\nMembers of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin binding patterns, presumably due to their interactions with various specificity factors. Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the protein-protein interaction between the HP1 protein Rhino, a critical factor of the Drosophila piRNA pathway, and Kipferl, a DNA sequence-specific C2H2 zinc finger protein and Rhino guidance factor. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhinos chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but abolishes the specific interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the rhinoG31D mutation phenocopy kipferl mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of rhinoG31D flies. Thus, Rhinos chromodomain serves as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.\nImprinting but not cytonuclear interactions affects parent-of-origin effect on seed size in Arabidopsis hybrids\nAuthors: June, V.; Song, X.; Chen, Z. J.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557997\nThe parent-of-origin effect on seed size can result from imprinting or a combinational effect between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes, but their relative contributions remain unknown. To discern these confounding effects, we generated cytoplasmic-nuclear substitution (CNS) lines using recurrent backcrossing in the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and C24. These CNS lines differ only in the nuclear genome (imprinting) or in the cytoplasm. The CNS reciprocal hybrids with the same cytoplasm display a [~]20% seed size difference as observed in the conventional hybrids. However, seed size is similar between the reciprocal cybrids with fixed imprinting. Transcriptome analyses in the endosperm of CNS hybrids using laser-capture microdissection have identified 104 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 90 paternally-expressed genes (PEGs). These imprinted genes are involved in pectin catabolism and cell wall modification in the endosperm. HDG9, an epiallele and one of 11 cross-specific imprinted genes, controls seed size. In the embryo, a handful of imprinted genes is found in the CNS hybrids but only one is expressed higher in the embryo than endosperm. AT4G13495 encodes a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), but no obvious seed phenotype is observed in the lncRNA knockout lines. NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of RNA Pol IV, is involved in the biogenesis of small interfering RNAs. Seed size and embryo is larger in the cross using nrpd1 as the maternal parent than in the reciprocal cross. In spite of limited ecotypes tested, these results suggest potential roles of imprinting and NRPD1-mediated small RNA pathway in seed size variation in hybrids.\nHLA-Based Banking of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in Saudi Arabia\nAuthors: Alowaysi, M.; Lehmann, R.; Al-Shehri, M.; Baadheim, M.; Alzahrani, H.; Aboalola, D.; Zia, A.; Malibari, D.; Daghestani, M.; Alghamdi, K.; Haneef, A.; Jawdat, D.; Hakami, F.; Cabrero, D. G.; Tegner, J.; Alsayegh, K.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.16.557826\nHuman iPSCs derivation and use in clinical studies are transforming medicine. Yet, there is a high cost and long waiting time for autologous iPS-based cellular therapy, and the genetic engineering of hypo-immunogenic iPS cell lines is hampered with numerous hurdles. Therefore, it is increasingly interesting to create cell stocks based on HLA haplotype distribution in a given population. In this study, we assessed the potential of HLA-based iPS banking for the Saudi population. First, we analyzed the HLA database of the Saudi Stem Cell Donor Registry (SSCDR), which contains high-resolution HLA genotype data of 64,315 registered Saudi donors at the time of analysis. We found that only 13 iPS lines would be required to cover 30% of the Saudi population, 39 iPS lines would offer 50% coverage and 596 for more than 90% coverage. Next, As a proof-of-concept, we launched the first HLA-based banking of iPSCs in Saudi Arabia. Using clinically relevant methods, we generated the first iPSC line from a homozygous donor for the most common HLA haplotype in Saudi. The two generated clones expressed pluripotency markers, could be differentiated into all three germ layers, beating cardiomyocytes and neuronal progenitors. To ensure that our reprogramming method generates genetically stable iPSCs, we assessed the mutational burden in the generated clones and the original blood sample from which the iPSCs were derived using whole-genome sequencing. All detected variants were found in the original donor sample and were classified as benign according to current guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). This study sets a road map for introducing iPS-based cell therapy in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nStable population structure in Europe since the Iron Age, despite high mobility\nAuthors: Antonio, M.

However, little is known about how population structure changed from the historical period onward (3,000 YBP - present). To address this, we collected whole genomes from 204 individuals from Europe and the Mediterranean, many of which are the first historical period genomes from their region (e.g. Armenia and France). We found that most regions show remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity. At least 7% of historical individuals carry ancestry uncommon in the region where they were sampled, some indicating cross-Mediterranean contacts. Despite this high level of mobility, overall population structure across western Eurasia is relatively stable through the historical period up to the present, mirroring geography. We show that, under standard population genetics models with local panmixia, the observed level of dispersal would lead to a collapse of population structure. Persistent population structure thus suggests a lower effective migration rate than indicated by the observed dispersal. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be explained by extensive transient dispersal arising from drastically improved transportation networks and the Roman Empires mobilization of people for trade, labor, and military. This work highlights the utility of ancient DNA in elucidating finer scale human population dynamics in recent history.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Identifying causal genes underlying genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a fundamental problem in human genetics. Although colocalisation with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is often used to prioritise GWAS target genes, systematic benchmarking has been limited due to unavailability of large ground truth datasets. Here, we re-analysed plasma protein QTL data from 3,301 individuals of the INTERVAL cohort together with 131 eQTL Catalogue datasets. Focusing on variants located within or close to the affected protein identified 793 proteins with at least one cis-pQTL where we could assume that the most likely causal gene was the gene coding for the protein. We then benchmarked the ability of cis-eQTLs to recover these causal genes by comparing three Bayesian colocalisation methods (coloc.susie, coloc.abf and CLPP) and five Mendelian randomisation (MR) approaches (three varieties of inversevariance weighted MR, MR-RAPS, and MRLocus). We found that assigning fine-mapped pQTLs to their closest protein coding genes outperformed all colocalisation methods regarding both precision (71.9%) and recall (76.9%). Furthermore, the colocalisation method with the highest recall (coloc.susie - 46.3%) also had the lowest precision (45.1%). Combining evidence from multiple conditionally distinct colocalising QTLs with MR increased precision to 81%, but this was accompanied by a large reduction in recall to 7.1%. Furthermore, the choice of the MR method greatly affected performance, with the standard inverse-variance weighted MR often producing many false positives. Our results highlight that linking GWAS variants to target genes remains challenging with eQTL evidence alone, and prioritising novel targets requires triangulation of evidence from multiple sources.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Eurasian Bronze Age (BA) has been described as a period of substantial human migrations, the emergence of pastoralism, horse domestication, and development of metallurgy. This study focuses on individuals associated with BA metallurgical production, specifically the Seima-Turbino (ST) phenomenon ([~]2,200-1,900 BCE) associated with elaborate metal objects found across Northern Eurasia. The genetic profiles of nine ST-associated individuals vary widely ranging between ancestries maximized in individuals from the Eastern Siberian Late Neolithic/BA, and those of the Western Steppe Middle Late BA. The genetic heterogeneity observed is consistent with the current understanding of the ST metallurgical network as a transcultural phenomenon. The new data also shed light on the temporal and spatial range of an ancient Siberian genetic ancestry component, which is shared across many Uralic-speaking populations, and which we explore further via demographic modeling using additional genome-wide (2 individuals) and whole genome data (5 individuals, including a [~]30x genome) from northwestern Russia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SummaryAdmixed populations, with their unique and diverse genetic backgrounds, are often underrepresented in genetic studies. This oversight not only limits our understanding but also exacerbates existing health disparities. One major barrier has been the lack of efficient tools tailored for the special challenges of genetic study of admixed populations. Here, we present admix-kit, an integrated toolkit and pipeline for genetic analyses of admixed populations. Admix-kit implements a suite of methods to facilitate genotype and phenotype simulation, association testing, genetic architecture inference, and polygenic scoring in admixed populations.

Availability and implementationAdmix-kit package is open-source and available at https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit. Additionally, users can use the pipeline designed for admixed genotype simulation available at https://github.com/UW-GAC/admix-kit_workflow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resolving the molecular basis of a Mendelian condition (MC) remains challenging owing to the diverse mechanisms by which genetic variants cause disease. To address this, we developed a synchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome, and transcriptome sequencing approach, which enables accurate single-nucleotide, insertion-deletion, and structural variant calling and diploid de novo genome assembly, and permits the simultaneous elucidation of haplotype-resolved CpG methylation, chromatin accessibility, and full-length transcript information in a single long-read sequencing run. Application of this approach to an Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) participant with a chromosome X;13 balanced translocation of uncertain significance revealed that this translocation disrupted the functioning of four separate genes (NBEA, PDK3, MAB21L1, and RB1) previously associated with single-gene MCs. Notably, the function of each gene was disrupted via a distinct mechanism that required integration of the four  omes to resolve. These included nonsense-mediated decay, fusion transcript formation, enhancer adoption, transcriptional readthrough silencing, and inappropriate X chromosome inactivation of autosomal genes. Overall, this highlights the utility of synchronized long-read multi-omic profiling for mechanistically resolving complex phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Both psychiatric vulnerability and cortical structure are shaped by the cumulative effect of common genetic variants across the genome. However, the shared genetic underpinnings between psychiatric disorders and brain structural phenotypes, such as thickness and surface area of the cerebral cortex, remains elusive. In this study, we employed pleiotropy-informed conjunctional false discovery rate analysis to investigate shared loci across genome-wide association scans of regional cortical thickness, surface area, and seven psychiatric disorders in approximately 700,000 individuals of European ancestry. Aggregating regional measures, we identified 50 genetic loci shared between psychiatric disorders and surface area, as well as 26 genetic loci shared with cortical thickness. Risk alleles exhibited bidirectional effects on both cortical thickness and surface area, such that some risk alleles for each disorder increased regional brain size while other risk alleles decreased regional brain size. Due to bidirectional effects, in many cases we observed extensive pleiotropy between an imaging phenotype and a psychiatric disorder even in the absence of a significant genetic correlation between them. The impact of genetic risk for psychiatric disorders on regional brain structure did exhibit a consistent pattern across highly comorbid psychiatric disorders, with 80% of the genetic loci shared across multiple disorders displaying consistent directions of effect. Cortical patterning of genetic overlap revealed a hierarchical genetic architecture, with the association cortex and sensorimotor cortex representing two extremes of shared genetic influence on psychiatric disorders and brain structural variation. Integrating multi-scale functional annotations and transcriptomic profiles, we observed that shared genetic loci were enriched in active genomic regions, converged on neurobiological and metabolic pathways, and showed differential expression in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with psychiatric disorders. Cumulatively, these findings provide a significant advance in our understanding of the overlapping polygenic architecture between psychopathology and cortical brain structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Applied eDNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate actionable results to inform management decisions, regulations, or policy development. Because of these important downstream considerations, optimizing workflow elements is now essential to increasing standardization, efficiency, and confidence of metabarcoding results. Reference DNA sequences are critical workflow elements that currently lack consistent approaches to generating, curating, or publishing. Here we present a complete (mitochondrial genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron) and high quality reference DNA sequence library for the freshwater fishes of British Columbia, Canada. This resource is published as the Novel Applied eDNA Metabarcoding Reference Sequences (NAMERS) repository (https://namers.ca), a user-friendly and interactive website for specialists and non-specialists alike to explore and generate custom reference libraries for taxa and genes of interest. We demonstrate the power of NAMERS to optimize applied eDNA metabarcoding workflows at the study design stage by analyzing the number of primer mismatches and resolution power of existing metabarcoding markers. To meet the increasing demand for actionable eDNA metabarcoding applications, NAMERS demonstrates that high quality curated genomic information is within a reasonable reach. It is timely to establish this framework as the new gold standard and coordinate our efforts to generate this type of reference data at scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin binding patterns, presumably due to their interactions with various specificity factors. Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the protein-protein interaction between the HP1 protein Rhino, a critical factor of the Drosophila piRNA pathway, and Kipferl, a DNA sequence-specific C2H2 zinc finger protein and Rhino guidance factor. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhinos chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but abolishes the specific interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the rhinoG31D mutation phenocopy kipferl mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of rhinoG31D flies. Thus, Rhinos chromodomain serves as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The parent-of-origin effect on seed size can result from imprinting or a combinational effect between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes, but their relative contributions remain unknown. To discern these confounding effects, we generated cytoplasmic-nuclear substitution (CNS) lines using recurrent backcrossing in the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and C24. These CNS lines differ only in the nuclear genome (imprinting) or in the cytoplasm. The CNS reciprocal hybrids with the same cytoplasm display a [~]20% seed size difference as observed in the conventional hybrids. However, seed size is similar between the reciprocal cybrids with fixed imprinting. Transcriptome analyses in the endosperm of CNS hybrids using laser-capture microdissection have identified 104 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 90 paternally-expressed genes (PEGs). These imprinted genes are involved in pectin catabolism and cell wall modification in the endosperm. HDG9, an epiallele and one of 11 cross-specific imprinted genes, controls seed size. In the embryo, a handful of imprinted genes is found in the CNS hybrids but only one is expressed higher in the embryo than endosperm. AT4G13495 encodes a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), but no obvious seed phenotype is observed in the lncRNA knockout lines. NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of RNA Pol IV, is involved in the biogenesis of small interfering RNAs. Seed size and embryo is larger in the cross using nrpd1 as the maternal parent than in the reciprocal cross. In spite of limited ecotypes tested, these results suggest potential roles of imprinting and NRPD1-mediated small RNA pathway in seed size variation in hybrids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human iPSCs derivation and use in clinical studies are transforming medicine. Yet, there is a high cost and long waiting time for autologous iPS-based cellular therapy, and the genetic engineering of hypo-immunogenic iPS cell lines is hampered with numerous hurdles. Therefore, it is increasingly interesting to create cell stocks based on HLA haplotype distribution in a given population. In this study, we assessed the potential of HLA-based iPS banking for the Saudi population. First, we analyzed the HLA database of the Saudi Stem Cell Donor Registry (SSCDR), which contains high-resolution HLA genotype data of 64,315 registered Saudi donors at the time of analysis. We found that only 13 iPS lines would be required to cover 30% of the Saudi population, 39 iPS lines would offer 50% coverage and 596 for more than 90% coverage.

Next, As a proof-of-concept, we launched the first HLA-based banking of iPSCs in Saudi Arabia. Using clinically relevant methods, we generated the first iPSC line from a homozygous donor for the most common HLA haplotype in Saudi. The two generated clones expressed pluripotency markers, could be differentiated into all three germ layers, beating cardiomyocytes and neuronal progenitors. To ensure that our reprogramming method generates genetically stable iPSCs, we assessed the mutational burden in the generated clones and the original blood sample from which the iPSCs were derived using whole-genome sequencing. All detected variants were found in the original donor sample and were classified as benign according to current guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).

This study sets a road map for introducing iPS-based cell therapy in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ancient DNA research in the past decade has revealed that European population structure changed dramatically in the prehistoric period (14,000-3,000 years before present, YBP), reflecting the widespread introduction of Neolithic farmer and Bronze Age Steppe ancestries. However, little is known about how population structure changed from the historical period onward (3,000 YBP - present). To address this, we collected whole genomes from 204 individuals from Europe and the Mediterranean, many of which are the first historical period genomes from their region (e.g. Armenia and France). We found that most regions show remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity. At least 7% of historical individuals carry ancestry uncommon in the region where they were sampled, some indicating cross-Mediterranean contacts. Despite this high level of mobility, overall population structure across western Eurasia is relatively stable through the historical period up to the present, mirroring geography. We show that, under standard population genetics models with local panmixia, the observed level of dispersal would lead to a collapse of population structure. Persistent population structure thus suggests a lower effective migration rate than indicated by the observed dispersal. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be explained by extensive transient dispersal arising from drastically improved transportation networks and the Roman Empires mobilization of people for trade, labor, and military. This work highlights the utility of ancient DNA in elucidating finer scale human population dynamics in recent history.</p>
