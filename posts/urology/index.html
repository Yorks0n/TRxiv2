Here, we report a pilot study based on microfluidic acoustophoresis enrichment of CTCs using the CellSearch CTC assay as a reference modality. MethodsAcoustophoresis uses an ultrasonic standing wave field to separate cells based on biomechanical properties (size, density, and compressibility) resulting in inherently label-free and epitope-independent cell enrichment. Following red blood cell lysis and paraformaldehyde fixation, 6 mL of whole blood from 12 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and 20 healthy controls were processed with acoustophoresis and subsequent image cytometry. ResultsAcoustophoresis enabled enrichment and characterization of phenotypic CTCs (EpCAM+, Cytokeratin+, DAPI+, CD45-/CD66b-) in all patients with metastatic prostate cancer and detected CTC-clusters composed of only CTCs or heterogenous aggregates of CTCs clustered with various types of white blood cells in 9 out of 12 patients. By contrast, CellSearch did not detect any CTC-clusters, but detected comparable numbers of phenotypic CTCs as acoustophoresis, with trends of finding higher number of CTCs using acoustophoresis. ConclusionOur preliminary data indicate that acoustophoresis provides excellent possibilities to detect and characterize CTC-clusters as a putative marker of metastatic disease and outcomes. Moreover, acoustophoresis enables sensitive label-free enrichment of cells with epithelial phenotype in blood and offers opportunities to detect and characterize CTCs undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitioning and lineage plasticity.\nA Spatial Comparison of Molecular Features Associated with Resistance to Pembrolizumab in BCG Unresponsive Bladder Cancer\nAuthors: Meghani, K.; Frydenlund, N.; Yu, Y.; Choy, B.; Meeks, J. J.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299093\nBackgroundIntravenous immune checkpoint inhibition achieves a 40% three-month response in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS). Yet only half of early responders will continue to be disease free by 12 months, and resistance mechanisms are poorly defined. ObjectiveWe assessed the molecular features associated with response to immunotherapy in BCG unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancers treated with pembrolizumab. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed digital spatial profiling (DSP) of BCG unresponsive NMIBC tumors before and after IV pembrolizumab therapy. InterventionPembrolizumab was administered intravenously in patients with NMIBC at the time of recurrence after BCG therapy. Biopsies were obtained before starting IV pembrolizumab and three months post-treatment. Outcomes and Statistical AnalysisSpatial gene expression profiling of the tumor niche pre- and post IV pembrolizumab. Results and LimitationsWe evaluated 119 regions of interest (ROIs) from five patients, which included 60 epithelial (PanCK+) and 59 stromal segments (PanCK-). ROIs from responders had distinct expression signatures from non-responders for both the tumor and TME. Responders were more likely to have a dynamic change in expression after pembrolizumab than non-responders. A major limitation of this study was the number of patients evaluated. ConclusionFor the first time, we have identified distinct expression signatures associated with response and resistance to IV pembrolizumab in NMIBCs. Further research with more patients and alternative checkpoint inhibitors is essential to validate our findings. Patient SummaryWe identify the molecular features of tumors associated with response to pembrolizumab for patients with BCG unresponsive NMIBCs.\n",
