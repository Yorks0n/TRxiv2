H.; Edwards, R. T.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294408\nBackgroundRegular exercise and community engagement may slow the rate of function loss for people with dementia. However, the evidence is uncertain regarding the cost-effectiveness and social return on investment (SROI) of home exercise with community referral for people with dementia. This study aimed to compare the social value generated from the in-person PrAISED programme delivered before March 2020 with a blended PrAISED programme delivered after March 2020. MethodsSROI analysis was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Of 205 patient participants and their carers who completed cost data, 61 completed an in-person programme before March 2020. Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, 144 patient participants completed a blended programme consisting of a combination of in-person visits, phone calls and video conferencing with multidisciplinary team (MDT) members. SROI analysis compared in-person and blended delivery formats. Five relevant and material outcomes were identified: three outcomes for patient participants (fear of falling, health-related quality of life, and social connection); one outcome for carer participants (carer strain index), and one outcome for the NHS (health service resource use). Data were collected at baseline and a 12-month follow-up. ResultsThe in-person PrAISED programme generated SROI ratios ranging from {pound}0.58 to {pound}2.33 for every {pound}1 invested. In-person PrAISED patient participants gained social value from improved health-related quality of life, social connection, and less fear of falling. In-person PrAISED carer participants acquired social value from less carer strain. The NHS gained benefit from less health care service resource use. However, the blended PrAISED programme generated lower SROI ratios ranging from a negative ratio to {pound}0.08: {pound}1. ConclusionCompared with the blended programme, the PrAISED in-person programme generated higher SROI ratios for people with early dementia. During the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions, a blended delivery of the programme and the curtailment of community activities resulted in lower SROI ratios during this period. An in-person PrAISED intervention with community referral is likely to provide better value for money than a blended one with limited community referral, despite the greater costs of the former. Trial registrationISRCTN15320670\nThe potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of the updated COVID-19 mRNA Fall 2023 vaccines in the United States\nAuthors: Kohli, M.; Maschio, M.; Joshi, K.; Lee, A.; Fust, K.; Beck, E.; Van de Velde, N.; Weinstein, M. C.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295085\nObjectives: To assess the potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines updated for Fall 2023 in adults [\u0026ge;]18 years over a 1-year analytic time horizon (September 2023-August 2024). Methods: A compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was updated to reflect COVID-19 in summer 2023. Numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, and costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were calculated using a decision tree model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a Moderna updated mRNA Fall 2023 vaccine (Moderna Fall Campaign) was compared to no additional vaccination. Potential differences between the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech Fall 2023 vaccines were examined. Results: Base case results suggest the Moderna Fall Campaign would decrease the expected 64.2 million symptomatic infections by 7.2 million (11%) to 57.0 million. COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths are expected to decline by 343,000 (-29%) and 50,500 (-33%), respectively. The Moderna Fall Campaign would increase QALYs by 740,880 and healthcare costs by $5.7 billion relative to No Vaccine, yielding an ICER of $7,700 per QALY gained. Using a societal cost perspective, the ICER is $2,100. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness, COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization rates and costs drive cost-effectiveness. With a relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of Moderna versus Pfizer-BioNTech of 5.1% for infection and 9.8% for hospitalization, use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 24,000 more hospitalizations and 3,300 more deaths than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Limitations and Conclusions: As COVID-19 becomes endemic, future incidence, including patterns of infection, are highly uncertain. Vaccine effectiveness of Fall 2023 vaccines is unknown, and it is unclear when a new variant that evades natural or vaccine immunity will emerge. Despite these limitations, the Moderna Fall 2023 vaccine can be considered cost-effective relative to no vaccine.\nA Literature Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Lockdowns on COVID-19 Mortality - II\nAuthors: Herby, J.; Jonung, L.; Hanke, S.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294845\nThe purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality based on available empirical evidence. Lockdowns are defined as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardized measures for inclusion in the meta-analysis. They are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2%. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0%. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7%. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behavior, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.\n",

Results: Base case results suggest the Moderna Fall Campaign would decrease the expected 64.2 million symptomatic infections by 7.2 million (11%) to 57.0 million. COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths are expected to decline by 343,000 (-29%) and 50,500 (-33%), respectively. The Moderna Fall Campaign would increase QALYs by 740,880 and healthcare costs by $5.7 billion relative to No Vaccine, yielding an ICER of $7,700 per QALY gained. Using a societal cost perspective, the ICER is $2,100. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness, COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization rates and costs drive cost-effectiveness. With a relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of Moderna versus Pfizer-BioNTech of 5.1% for infection and 9.8% for hospitalization, use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 24,000 more hospitalizations and 3,300 more deaths than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Limitations and Conclusions: As COVID-19 becomes endemic, future incidence, including patterns of infection, are highly uncertain. Vaccine effectiveness of Fall 2023 vaccines is unknown, and it is unclear when a new variant that evades natural or vaccine immunity will emerge. Despite these limitations, the Moderna Fall 2023 vaccine can be considered cost-effective relative to no vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality based on available empirical evidence. Lockdowns are defined as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We employ a systematic search and screening procedure in which 19,646 studies are identified that could potentially address the purpose of our study. After three levels of screening, 32 studies qualified. Of those, estimates from 22 studies could be converted to standardized measures for inclusion in the meta-analysis. They are separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place-order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. Stringency index studies find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 3.2%. This translates into approximately 6,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 4,000 in the United States. SIPOs were also relatively ineffective in the spring of 2020, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.0%. This translates into approximately 4,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 3,000 in the United States. Based on specific NPIs, we estimate that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by 10.7%. This translates into approximately 23,000 avoided deaths in Europe and 16,000 in the United States. In comparison, there are approximately 72,000 flu deaths in Europe and 38,000 flu deaths in the United States each year. When checked for potential biases, our results are robust. Our results are also supported by the natural experiments we have been able to identify. The results of our meta-analysis support the conclusion that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. This result is consistent with the view that voluntary changes in behavior, such as social distancing, did play an important role in mitigating the pandemic.</p>
