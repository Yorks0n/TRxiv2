However, its impact on the NHS remains to be determined. ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the healthcare utilisation of individuals with long COVID. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted a matched cohort study using primary and secondary care data via OpenSAFELY, a platform for analysing anonymous electronic health records. The long COVID exposure group, defined by diagnostic codes, was matched with five comparators without long COVID between Nov 2020 and Jan 2023. We compared their total healthcare utilisation from GP consultations, prescriptions, hospital admissions, A\u0026E visits, and outpatient appointments. Healthcare utilisation and costs were evaluated using a two-part model adjusting for covariates. Using a difference-in-difference model, we also compared healthcare utilisation after long COVID with pre-pandemic records. ResultsWe identified 52,988 individuals with a long COVID diagnosis, matched to 264,867 comparators without a diagnosis. In the 12 months post-diagnosis, there was strong evidence that those with long COVID were more likely to use healthcare resources (OR: 8.07, 95% CI: 7.54 - 8.64), and have 49% more healthcare utilisation (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.47 - 1.50). Our model estimated that the long COVID group had 30 healthcare visits per year (predicted mean: 29.23, 95% CI: 28.58 - 29.92), compared to 16 in the comparator group (predicted mean visits: 16.04, 95% CI: 15.73 - 16.36). Individuals with long COVID were more likely to have non-zero healthcare expenditures (OR = 7.47, 95% CI = 7.02 - 7.95), with costs being 43% higher than the comparator group (cost ratio = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.49). The long COVID group costs approximately {pound}2,500 per person per year (predicted mean cost: {pound}2,562.50, 95% CI: {pound}2,335.60 - {pound}2,819.22), and the comparator group costs {pound}1,500 (predicted mean cost: {pound}1,527.43, 95% CI: {pound}1,404.33 - 1,664.45.) Historically, individuals with long COVID utilised healthcare resources more frequently, but their average healthcare utilisation increased more after being diagnosed with long COVID, compared to the comparator group. ConclusionLong COVID increases healthcare utilisation and costs. Public health policies should allocate more resources towards preventing, treating, and supporting individuals with long COVID.\nState-wise Economic Burden of Road Traffic Accidents in India\nAuthors: Kumar, S. S.; Bagepally, B. S.; Sasidharan, A.; Jagadeesh, K. V.; Ponniah, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300419\nIntroductionRoad traffic accidents (RTA) cause multifarious detrimental consequences, including fatality and serious injuries. RTAs cause considerable financial strain on healthcare systems with high costs of medical care, long-term care for the injured, and lost productivity. To assess this burden, we estimated state-wise economic costs of RTA in India. We followed CHEERS Checklist 2022 to present studys methods and outcomes. MethodsData were obtained from Global Burden of Disease Injuries and Risk Factors study, Government of Indias budget documents, annual reports of National Health Authority, controller general of accounts, and Economic Surveys. Cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY), direct costs, indirect costs and total costs associated with RTA burden were estimated for India and by its states. ResultsRTA burden declined in all Indian states except Jammu and Kashmir (with a minor increase from 1,458 to 1,564 DALYs per 100,000) and Rajasthan (from 1,275 to 1,394 DALYs per 100,000) during 2010-19 period. Estimated mean cost per DALY in India due to RTA (95%CI) was {square}1,821({square}1,606 to {square}2,036) [US$ 22(19 to 24)] with a median (IQR) of {square}1,609(551) [US$ 19 (7)]. As of 2019, the estimated mean total cost of RTA burden in India was {square}1,017 billion [US$ 12 billion], with a median (IQR) of {square}731 billion(1,220 billion) [US$ 9 billion(15 billion)]. ConclusionBurden of RTAs declined across the Indian States during 2010-2019, and same was not observed with fiscal implications. The study reiterates the need for strategic road safety interventions to ameliorate socio-economic and health impacts of RTAs in India.\nThe impact of higher uptake of plant-based diets in England: model-based estimates of health care resource use and health-related quality of life\nAuthors: Henderson, N.; Sampson, C. J.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23300536\nPlant-based diets have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because of the perceived health benefits; higher consumption of vegetables and other healthy foods is associated with better nutrition and reduced risk of disease. In this study, we estimate the potential impact of higher uptake of a 100% plant-based (vegan) diet in England from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). We estimate the impact in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care expenditure, and total net benefit compared to the current level of uptake. This model-based analysis combines estimates for disease prevalence, the relative risk of disease associated with a vegan diet, and disease-specific health state utility values (HSUVs) and health care costs. We conducted a literature review to identify the most suitable inputs to the model, which included estimates for cancer, coronary heart disease, cataracts, diverticular disease, bone fractures, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The model is open-source and implemented in an interactive online dashboard, allowing for further extension and exploration of the findings. In our base case analysis with 100% adoption of a plant-based diet in England, the total health care cost savings across all considered diseases is around 6.7 billion GBP per year, with 172,735 additional QALYs, and a total net benefit to the NHS of around 18.8 billion GBP when QALYs are valued at 70,000 GBP. The majority of potential savings are realised through the avoidance of almost 1.3 million cases of type 2 diabetes. Numerous challenges are associated with estimating the impact of widespread dietary changes in society. However, strong evidence shows that plant-based diets are associated with better health outcomes for some of England's most significant causes of disease burden. Higher rates of plant-based diet adoption may bring considerable cost savings for the NHS and generate substantial health benefits for the population. Policymakers should consider the relevance of these estimates to their settings and the potential for interventions that support healthy dietary changes that contribute to population health. Future research should seek to identify the causal effects of plant-based diet adoption on health outcomes, and health care resource use across different populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRoad traffic accidents (RTA) cause multifarious detrimental consequences, including fatality and serious injuries. RTAs cause considerable financial strain on healthcare systems with high costs of medical care, long-term care for the injured, and lost productivity. To assess this burden, we estimated state-wise economic costs of RTA in India. We followed CHEERS Checklist 2022 to present studys methods and outcomes.

MethodsData were obtained from Global Burden of Disease Injuries and Risk Factors study, Government of Indias budget documents, annual reports of National Health Authority, controller general of accounts, and Economic Surveys. Cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY), direct costs, indirect costs and total costs associated with RTA burden were estimated for India and by its states.

ResultsRTA burden declined in all Indian states except Jammu and Kashmir (with a minor increase from 1,458 to 1,564 DALYs per 100,000) and Rajasthan (from 1,275 to 1,394 DALYs per 100,000) during 2010-19 period. Estimated mean cost per DALY in India due to RTA (95%CI) was {square}1,821({square}1,606 to {square}2,036) [US$ 22(19 to 24)] with a median (IQR) of {square}1,609(551) [US$ 19 (7)]. As of 2019, the estimated mean total cost of RTA burden in India was {square}1,017 billion [US$ 12 billion], with a median (IQR) of {square}731 billion(1,220 billion) [US$ 9 billion(15 billion)].

ConclusionBurden of RTAs declined across the Indian States during 2010-2019, and same was not observed with fiscal implications. The study reiterates the need for strategic road safety interventions to ameliorate socio-economic and health impacts of RTAs in India.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plant-based diets have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because of the perceived health benefits; higher consumption of vegetables and other healthy foods is associated with better nutrition and reduced risk of disease. In this study, we estimate the potential impact of higher uptake of a 100% plant-based (vegan) diet in England from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). We estimate the impact in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care expenditure, and total net benefit compared to the current level of uptake. This model-based analysis combines estimates for disease prevalence, the relative risk of disease associated with a vegan diet, and disease-specific health state utility values (HSUVs) and health care costs. We conducted a literature review to identify the most suitable inputs to the model, which included estimates for cancer, coronary heart disease, cataracts, diverticular disease, bone fractures, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The model is open-source and implemented in an interactive online dashboard, allowing for further extension and exploration of the findings. In our base case analysis with 100% adoption of a plant-based diet in England, the total health care cost savings across all considered diseases is around 6.7 billion GBP per year, with 172,735 additional QALYs, and a total net benefit to the NHS of around 18.8 billion GBP when QALYs are valued at 70,000 GBP. The majority of potential savings are realised through the avoidance of almost 1.3 million cases of type 2 diabetes. Numerous challenges are associated with estimating the impact of widespread dietary changes in society. However, strong evidence shows that plant-based diets are associated with better health outcomes for some of England&#39;s most significant causes of disease burden. Higher rates of plant-based diet adoption may bring considerable cost savings for the NHS and generate substantial health benefits for the population. Policymakers should consider the relevance of these estimates to their settings and the potential for interventions that support healthy dietary changes that contribute to population health. Future research should seek to identify the causal effects of plant-based diet adoption on health outcomes, and health care resource use across different populations.</p>
