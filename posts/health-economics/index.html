  "articleBody": " Associations of Alzheimer's disease with inpatient hospital costs and with quality-adjusted life years: Evidence from conventional and Mendelian randomization analyses in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Dixon, P.; Anderson, E. L.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.09.23299763\nBACKGROUNDAlzheimers disease and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative disorders with profound impacts on cognitive function. There is a shortage of economic evidence relating to the impact Alzheimers disease on healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). METHODSWe employed two study designs to model the association between Alzheimers disease and healthcare costs and QALYs. We first estimated conventional multivariable models of the association between Alzheimers disease and these core economic outcomes. However, these types of model may be confounded by diseases, processes, or traits that independently affect Alzheimers disease and either or both of healthcare costs and QALYs. We therefore also explored a complementary approach using germline genetic variation as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization analysis. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in recent genome-wide association studies of Alzheimers disease as instruments. We studied outcome data on inpatient hospital costs and QALYs in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTSData from up to 310,838 individuals were analyzed. N=55 cases of Alzheimers disease were reported at or before recruitment into UK Biobank. A further N=284 incident cases were identified over follow-up. Multivariable observational analysis of the prevalent cases suggested significant impacts on costs ({pound}1,140 in cases, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): {pound}825 to {pound}1,456) and QALYs (-25%, 95% CI: -28% to -21%). Mendelian randomization estimates were very imprecise for costs ({pound}3,082, 95% CI: -{pound}7,183 to {pound}13,348) and QALYs (-32%, 95% CI: -149% to 85%), likely due to the small proportion of variance (0.9%) explained in Alzheimers disease status by the most predictive set of SNPs. IMPLICATIONSConventional multivariable models suggested important impacts of Alzheimers disease on inpatient hospital costs and QALYs, although this finding was based on very few cases which may have included instances of early-onset dementia. Mendelian randomization was very imprecise. Larger GWAS of clinical cases, improved understanding of the architecture of the disease, and the follow-up of cohorts until old age and death will help overcome these challenges.\nTreating Rheumatoid Arthritis in Zanzibar: a cost effectiveness study comparing conventional, biologic, and targeted-synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs\nAuthors: Said, S. S.; KuÌˆhl, M.-J.; Fevang, B.-T. S.; Nystad, T. W.; Johansson, K. A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299489\nTo evaluate the cost effectiveness of six disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treat-to-target treatment strategies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Zanzibar. A Markov model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of various DMARD strategies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis over a three-year period. A health-provider perspective was used and only outpatient costs were considered. The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was utilized for measurement of efficacy and values were obtained from literature. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were obtained from 122 patients attending the rheumatology clinic at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital. Data on costs were obtained from the central medical stores and hospital administration. Treatment strategies were given in sequential approach based on treat to target goals of therapy. This included methotrexate monotherapy, methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate followed by one or two biologic/targeted-synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs). Probabilistic and one way sensitivity analysis were performed. Scenario analysis was undertaken comparing drug prices from India and Scandinavia. Costs of therapy/patient/three years ranged from USD 634 for methotrexate monotherapy and USD 5011 for methotrexate and two consecutive b/tsDMARDs. The highest and lowest effects were 2.209 and 2.079 QALYs gained from methotrexate therapy + two consecutive b/tsDMARDs and methotrexate monotherapy, respectively. From a healthcare perspective methotrexate monotherapy was the cost-effective option at a willingness to pay of USD 282. Pairwise comparison also favored methotrexate monotherapy as the feasible option. We found that increasing the willingness to pay led to a change in the most acceptable option from methotrexate monotherapy to methotrexate followed by b/tsDMARD. Methotrexate monotherapy is the cost-effective option for the management of rheumatoid arthritis in Zanzibar. Other options may be feasible if the willingness to pay threshold is increased or the drug prices are lowered, particularly for the b/tsDMARDs.\nThe impact of Long COVID on Health-Related Quality-of-life using OpenPROMPT\nAuthors: Carlile, O.; Briggs, A.; Henderson, A.; Butler-Cole, B.; Tazare, J.; Tomlinson, L.; Marks, M.; Jit, M.; Lin, L.-Y.; Bates, C.; Parry, J.; Bacon, S.; Dillingham, I.; Dennison, W.; Costello, R.; Walker, A.; Hulme, W. J.; Goldacre, B.; Mehrkar, A.; MacKenna, B.; The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, ; Herrett, E.; Eggo, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299601\nBackgroundLong COVID is a major problem affecting patient health, the health service, and the workforce. To optimise the design of future interventions against COVID-19, and to better plan and allocate health resources, it is critical to quantify the health and economic burden of this novel condition. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we developed OpenPROMPT, a UK cohort study measuring the impact of long COVID on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). OpenPROMPT invited responses to Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) using a smartphone application and recruited between November 2022 and October 2023. We used the validated EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire with the UK Value Set to develop disutility scores (1-utility) for respondents with and without Long COVID using linear mixed models, and we calculated subsequent Quality-Adjusted Life-Months (QALMs) for long COVID. ResultsWe used data from 6,070 participants where 24.7% self-reported long COVID. In multivariable regressions, long COVID had a consistent impact on HRQoL, showing a high probability of reporting loss in quality-of-life (OR: 22, 95% CI:12.35-39.29) compared with people who did not report long COVID. Reporting a disability was the largest predictor of losses of HRQoL (OR: 60.2, 95% CI: 27.79-130.57) across survey responses. Self-reported long COVID was associated with an 0.37 QALM loss. ConclusionsWe found substantial impacts on quality-of-life due to long COVID, representing a major burden on patients and the health service. We highlight the need for continued support and research for long COVID, as HRQoL scores compared unfavourably to patients with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, heart failure, and renal disease.\n",

The highest and lowest effects were 2.209 and 2.079 QALYs gained from methotrexate therapy &#43; two consecutive b/tsDMARDs and methotrexate monotherapy, respectively. From a healthcare perspective methotrexate monotherapy was the cost-effective option at a willingness to pay of USD 282. Pairwise comparison also favored methotrexate monotherapy as the feasible option. We found that increasing the willingness to pay led to a change in the most acceptable option from methotrexate monotherapy to methotrexate followed by b/tsDMARD.

Methotrexate monotherapy is the cost-effective option for the management of rheumatoid arthritis in Zanzibar. Other options may be feasible if the willingness to pay threshold is increased or the drug prices are lowered, particularly for the b/tsDMARDs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID is a major problem affecting patient health, the health service, and the workforce. To optimise the design of future interventions against COVID-19, and to better plan and allocate health resources, it is critical to quantify the health and economic burden of this novel condition.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we developed OpenPROMPT, a UK cohort study measuring the impact of long COVID on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). OpenPROMPT invited responses to Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) using a smartphone application and recruited between November 2022 and October 2023. We used the validated EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire with the UK Value Set to develop disutility scores (1-utility) for respondents with and without Long COVID using linear mixed models, and we calculated subsequent Quality-Adjusted Life-Months (QALMs) for long COVID.

ResultsWe used data from 6,070 participants where 24.7% self-reported long COVID. In multivariable regressions, long COVID had a consistent impact on HRQoL, showing a high probability of reporting loss in quality-of-life (OR: 22, 95% CI:12.35-39.29) compared with people who did not report long COVID. Reporting a disability was the largest predictor of losses of HRQoL (OR: 60.2, 95% CI: 27.79-130.57) across survey responses. Self-reported long COVID was associated with an 0.37 QALM loss.

ConclusionsWe found substantial impacts on quality-of-life due to long COVID, representing a major burden on patients and the health service. We highlight the need for continued support and research for long COVID, as HRQoL scores compared unfavourably to patients with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, heart failure, and renal disease.</p>
