However, its impact on the NHS remains to be determined. Objective: This study aims to assess the healthcare utilisation of individuals with long COVID. Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a matched cohort study using primary and secondary care data via OpenSAFELY, a platform for analysing anonymous electronic health records. The long COVID exposure group, defined by diagnostic codes, was matched with five comparators without long COVID between Nov 2020 and Jan 2023. We compared their total healthcare utilisation from GP consultations, prescriptions, hospital admissions, A\u0026E visits, and outpatient appointments. Healthcare utilisation and costs were evaluated using a two-part model adjusting for covariates. Using a difference-in-difference model, we also compared healthcare utilisation after long COVID with pre-pandemic records. Results: We identified 52,988 individuals with a long COVID diagnosis, matched to 264,867 comparators without a diagnosis. In the 12 months post-diagnosis, there was strong evidence that those with long COVID were more likely to use healthcare resources (OR: 8.07, 95% CI: 7.54 - 8.64), and have 49% more healthcare utilisation (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.47 - 1.50). Our model estimated that the long COVID group had 30 healthcare visits per year (predicted mean: 29.23, 95% CI: 28.58 - 29.92), compared to 16 in the comparator group (predicted mean visits: 16.04, 95% CI: 15.73 - 16.36). Individuals with long COVID were more likely to have non-zero healthcare expenditures (OR = 7.47, 95% CI = 7.02 - 7.95), with costs being 43% higher than the comparator group (cost ratio = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.49). The long COVID group costs approximately 2,500 pounds per person per year (predicted mean cost: 2,562.50, 95% CI: 2,335.60- 2,819.22 pounds), and the comparator group costs 1,500 pounds (predicted mean cost: 1,527.43, 95% CI: 1,404.33 - 1,664.45 pounds.) Historically, individuals with long COVID utilised healthcare resources more frequently, but their average healthcare utilisation increased more after being diagnosed with long COVID, compared to the comparator group. Conclusion: Long COVID increases healthcare utilisation and costs. Public health policies should allocate more resources towards preventing, treating, and supporting individuals with long COVID.\nState-wise Economic Burden of Road Traffic Accidents in India\nAuthors: Kumar, S. S.; Bagepally, B. S.; Sasidharan, A.; Jagadeesh, K. V.; Ponniah, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300419\nIntroduction: Road traffic accidents (RTA) cause multifarious detrimental consequences including loss of life and serious injuries. Further RTAs cause considerable financial strain on healthcare systems due to high costs of medical care, long-term care for the injured, and lost productivity. To assess this economic burden, we estimated state-wise economic costs of RTA in India. We followed the CHEERS Checklist 2022 to present our study's methodology and outcomes concisely and comprehensively. Methods: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease injuries and risk factors study, Government of Indias budget documents, annual report of the controller general of accounts and National Health Authority's annual reports 2019 and that of Economic Surveys. Cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY), direct cost, indirect costs and total costs associated with RTA burden were estimated for India and by its States. Results: RTA burden declined in all Indian states except Jammu and Kashmir (with a minor increase from 1,458 to 1,564 DALYs per 100,000) and Rajasthan (from 1,275 to 1,394 DALYs per 100,000) during 2010-19 period. Estimated mean cost per DALY in India due to RTA (95% CI) was {rupee}1,821({rupee}1,606 to {rupee}2,036) [US$ 22(19 to 24)] with a median (IQR) of {rupee}1,609(551) [US$ 19 (7)]. As of 2019, the estimated mean total cost of RTA burden in India was {rupee}1,017 billion [US$ 12 billion], with a median (IQR) of {rupee}731 billion (1,220 billion) [US$ 9 billion(15 billion)]. Conclusion: Burden of RTAs declined across the Indian States during 2010-2019 and same was not observed with fiscal implications. The study reiterates the need for strategic road safety interventions to ameliorate socio-economic and health impacts of RTAs in India.\n",

Results: RTA burden declined in all Indian states except Jammu and Kashmir (with a minor increase from 1,458 to 1,564 DALYs per 100,000) and Rajasthan (from 1,275 to 1,394 DALYs per 100,000) during 2010-19 period. Estimated mean cost per DALY in India due to RTA (95% CI) was {rupee}1,821({rupee}1,606 to {rupee}2,036) [US$ 22(19 to 24)] with a median (IQR) of {rupee}1,609(551) [US$ 19 (7)]. As of 2019, the estimated mean total cost of RTA burden in India was {rupee}1,017 billion [US$ 12 billion], with a median (IQR) of {rupee}731 billion (1,220 billion) [US$ 9 billion(15 billion)]. Conclusion: Burden of RTAs declined across the Indian States during 2010-2019 and same was not observed with fiscal implications. The study reiterates the need for strategic road safety interventions to ameliorate socio-economic and health impacts of RTAs in India.</p>
