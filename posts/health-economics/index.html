ObjectiveThis study evaluates how a subsidized, mobile phone-based health insurance program affected insurance uptake, healthcare utilization and health expenditures for low-income women and their family members in Western Kenya. The program, targeting pregnant women and mothers of children below age four, addressed both demand- and supply-side constraints, providing subsidies through mobile money and support in digital registration while upgrading selected facilities and digitally training community health workers.">

The program, targeting pregnant women and mothers of children below age four, addressed both demand- and supply-side constraints, providing subsidies through mobile money and support in digital registration while upgrading selected facilities and digitally training community health workers. MethodsThe research was based on a cluster-RCT conducted between 2019 and 2021 in 24 villages in Kakamega County. After a baseline survey, 240 households (more than 1,300 individuals) were interviewed every week during 18 months to collect detailed financial and health data while the program was rolled out in the treatment communities, moving to phone-based interviewing after the onset of COVID-19. ResultsThe intervention had a significant impact on individual insurance uptake of 65.8 percentage points (from a baseline control mean 18.9 percent). We find weak positive impacts on formal healthcare utilization, and substantial increases in financial coverage of medical costs and associated reductions in out-of-pocket expenditures, particularly for medicines. Results are strongest for women, young children and individuals living closest to the clinics. Dynamic analyses show that impacts become increasingly pronounced over time, suggesting that women may need some time to get used to the digital insurance scheme. ConclusionThe program not only reduced the costs of enrolment, but also eliminated other (administrative, logistical, trust) barriers. The introduction of the scheme by trusted local agents, the hands-on assistance with the digital registration procedures at womens homes, and support in retrieving the necessary documentation such as childrens birth certificates, have likely all contributed to the high enrolment rates, thereby improving access to good-quality care. Digital insurance has the potential to substantially enhance universal health coverage and financial protection for poor households.\n",
