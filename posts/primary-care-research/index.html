Accordingly, we sought to compare on-treatment weight loss in a real-world setting for adults with overweight or obesity initiated on tirzepatide or semaglutide. MethodsAdults with overweight or obesity first dispensed semaglutide or tirzepatide between May 2022 and September 2023 were identified from Truveta Data, a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset linked with comprehensive pharmacy dispensing data. The study cohort was restricted to patients with no prior GLP-1 RA use, who initiated a formulation of semaglutide or tirzepatide labelled for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) (a proxy for dose), received regular care in the previous year, had a GLP-1 RA prescription written in the 60 days prior to initiation, and had an available baseline weight. On treatment weight changes in a propensity score matched population were compared for outcomes of time to 5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss, and percentage change in weight by 3, 6, and 12 months. For all outcomes, we conducted subgroup analyses stratified by T2D (on-label users) and sensitivity analyses using inverse probability of treatment weighting.

B.; Alem, A. B.; Seward, N.; Eshetu, T.; Gebremariam, T. H.; Getachew, Y.; Mengiste, W.; Medhin, G.; Fairall, L.; Sevdalis, N.; Prince, M. J.; Fekadu, A.; Hanlon, C.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298770\nBackgroundThe Ethiopian Primary Healthcare Clinical Guidelines (EPHCG) seek to improve quality for people with Non-Communicable Diseases and Mental Health Conditions (NCDs-MHCs) and provide an integrated approach to multi-morbidity. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers to implementation of the EPHCG with a particular focus on NCDs-MHCs. MethodsA mixed-methods convergent-parallel design was employed from May, 2019 to January, 2020 after implementation of EPHCG in 18 health facilities across four districts and one town administration in southern Ethiopia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 primary healthcare clinicians and one healthcare administrator to identify barriers and enablers. The Organisational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) questionnaire was self-completed by 124 health workers to identify facility level readiness for change. Determinants from both approaches were mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) were employed to select potential implementation strategies to address barriers. ResultsFour thematic domains, EPHCG training and implementation, awareness and meeting patient needs (demand side), resource constraints/barriers (supply side) and care pathway bottlenecks were identified. The innovative facility-based training to implement the guidelines had a mixed response, especially in busy facilities where teams reported struggling to find protected time to meet. Key barriers to implementation of EPHCG were non-availability of resources (CFIR inner setting), such as reagents for laboratory tests and medications that undermined efforts to follow guideline-based care; the way care was structured and lack of familiarity with providing care for people with NCDs-MHCs. Substantial barriers arose because of interlinked socio-economic problems that were interlined with health but not addressable within the health system (CFIR outer setting). Several behavioural determinants influenced effective implementation of EPHCG (TDF), including low population awareness about NCDs/MHCs and unaffordable diagnostic and treatment services. Implementation strategies were identified. Survey findings indicated high scores of organisational readiness to implement the desired change but were notably more positive than the qualitative data. ConclusionsAlthough perceived as important and necessary, practical implementation of EPHCG was constrained by challenges across domains of internal/external context and behavioural determinants. This was especially marked in relation to expansion of care responsibilities to include NCDs-MHCs. Attention to social determinants of health outcomes, community engagement and awareness-raising are needed to maximize population impact.\nManagement of Antipsychotics in Primary Care: Insights from Healthcare Professionals and Policy Makers in the UK\nAuthors: Woodall, A. A.; Abuzour, A. S.; Wilson, S. A.; Mair, F. S.; Buchan, I.; Sheard, S. B.; Atkinson, P.; Joyce, D. W.; Symon, P.; Walker, L. E.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298487\nIntroductionAntipsychotic medication is increasingly prescribed to patients with serious mental illness. Patients with serious mental illness often have cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, and antipsychotics independently increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Despite this, many patients prescribed antipsychotics are discharged to primary care without planned psychiatric review. We explore perceptions of healthcare professionals and managers/planners of policy regarding management of antipsychotics in primary care. MethodsQualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 11 general practitioners (GPs), 8 psychiatrists, and 11 managers/planners of policy in the United Kingdom. Interviews were studied using inductive thematic analysis. ResultsRespondents reported competency gaps that impaired ability to manage patients prescribed antipsychotic medications holistically, arising from inadequate postgraduate training and professional development. GPs lacked confidence to manage antipsychotic medications alone; psychiatrists lacked skills to address cardiometabolic risks and did not perceive this as their role. Communication barriers, lack of integrated care records, limited psychology provision, lowered expectation of patients with serious mental illness by professionals, and pressure to discharge from hospital resulted in patients in primary care becoming trapped on antipsychotics, inhibiting opportunities to deprescribe. Organisational and contractual barriers between organisations exacerbate this risk, with socioeconomic deprivation and lack of access to non-pharmacological alternatives driving overprescribing. GPs and psychiatrists voiced professional fears of being blamed if an event causing harm occurred after stopping an antipsychotic, which inhibited deprescribing. A range of actions to overcome these barriers were suggested. ConclusionsPeople prescribed antipsychotics experience a fragmented health system and suboptimal care. Many simple steps could be taken to improve quality of care for this population but inadequate availability of non-pharmacological alternatives and socioeconomic factors increasing mental distress need key policy changes to improve the current situation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBoth tirzepatide and semaglutide have been shown to reduce weight for patients with overweight or obesity in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While tirzepatide appears to provide greater weight loss than semaglutide in this population, head-to-head RCTs are not yet available. Accordingly, we sought to compare on-treatment weight loss in a real-world setting for adults with overweight or obesity initiated on tirzepatide or semaglutide.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Ethiopian Primary Healthcare Clinical Guidelines (EPHCG) seek to improve quality for people with Non-Communicable Diseases and Mental Health Conditions (NCDs-MHCs) and provide an integrated approach to multi-morbidity. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers to implementation of the EPHCG with a particular focus on NCDs-MHCs.

MethodsA mixed-methods convergent-parallel design was employed from May, 2019 to January, 2020 after implementation of EPHCG in 18 health facilities across four districts and one town administration in southern Ethiopia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 primary healthcare clinicians and one healthcare administrator to identify barriers and enablers. The Organisational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) questionnaire was self-completed by 124 health workers to identify facility level readiness for change. Determinants from both approaches were mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) were employed to select potential implementation strategies to address barriers.

ResultsFour thematic domains, EPHCG training and implementation, awareness and meeting patient needs (demand side), resource constraints/barriers (supply side) and care pathway bottlenecks were identified. The innovative facility-based training to implement the guidelines had a mixed response, especially in busy facilities where teams reported struggling to find protected time to meet. Key barriers to implementation of EPHCG were non-availability of resources (CFIR inner setting), such as reagents for laboratory tests and medications that undermined efforts to follow guideline-based care; the way care was structured and lack of familiarity with providing care for people with NCDs-MHCs. Substantial barriers arose because of interlinked socio-economic problems that were interlined with health but not addressable within the health system (CFIR outer setting). Several behavioural determinants influenced effective implementation of EPHCG (TDF), including low population awareness about NCDs/MHCs and unaffordable diagnostic and treatment services. Implementation strategies were identified. Survey findings indicated high scores of organisational readiness to implement the desired change but were notably more positive than the qualitative data.

ConclusionsAlthough perceived as important and necessary, practical implementation of EPHCG was constrained by challenges across domains of internal/external context and behavioural determinants. This was especially marked in relation to expansion of care responsibilities to include NCDs-MHCs. Attention to social determinants of health outcomes, community engagement and awareness-raising are needed to maximize population impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAntipsychotic medication is increasingly prescribed to patients with serious mental illness. Patients with serious mental illness often have cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, and antipsychotics independently increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Despite this, many patients prescribed antipsychotics are discharged to primary care without planned psychiatric review. We explore perceptions of healthcare professionals and managers/planners of policy regarding management of antipsychotics in primary care.

MethodsQualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 11 general practitioners (GPs), 8 psychiatrists, and 11 managers/planners of policy in the United Kingdom. Interviews were studied using inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsRespondents reported competency gaps that impaired ability to manage patients prescribed antipsychotic medications holistically, arising from inadequate postgraduate training and professional development. GPs lacked confidence to manage antipsychotic medications alone; psychiatrists lacked skills to address cardiometabolic risks and did not perceive this as their role. Communication barriers, lack of integrated care records, limited psychology provision, lowered expectation of patients with serious mental illness by professionals, and pressure to discharge from hospital resulted in patients in primary care becoming  trapped on antipsychotics, inhibiting opportunities to deprescribe. Organisational and contractual barriers between organisations exacerbate this risk, with socioeconomic deprivation and lack of access to non-pharmacological alternatives driving overprescribing. GPs and psychiatrists voiced professional fears of being blamed if an event causing harm occurred after stopping an antipsychotic, which inhibited deprescribing. A range of actions to overcome these barriers were suggested.

ConclusionsPeople prescribed antipsychotics experience a fragmented health system and suboptimal care. Many simple steps could be taken to improve quality of care for this population but inadequate availability of non-pharmacological alternatives and socioeconomic factors increasing mental distress need key policy changes to improve the current situation.</p>
