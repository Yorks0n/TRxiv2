Although 3HB concentrations in the maternal blood are approximately 0.1, those in the amniotic fluid are approximately 0.6 mM. High placental 3HB production is potentially key for producing and maintaining high 3HB levels in the amniotic fluid. The rate-limiting enzyme, mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), is highly expressed in the cells of the chorionic plate and responsible for 3HB production. Therefore, high HMGCS2 expression maintenance is supposed to be pivotal for maintaining the 3HB supply for the human fetus. Here, we propose that humans display two pathways, an amniotic fluid- and another umbilical vein-mediated, for supplying 3HB to the human fetus. These supply pathways are supposedly essential for human brain development during the late phase of pregnancy.

MethodAn anonymous online survey of women, administered via Qualtrics Australia, was open for 4 weeks between November - December 2021. The survey consisted of a 45-item questionnaire collecting data on demographics (including pregnancy status), attitudes/beliefs regarding conducting exercise during pregnancy, knowledge of exercise in pregnancy guidelines, exercise in pregnancy experience and mental health experiences of responders during pregnancy. Analysis of responses were restricted to those who have experienced a pregnancy. Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were calculated for all questions. Pearsons Chi-Squared tests were used to determine the differences in response by mental health status (p \u003c 0.05). ResultsThere were 695 eligible responses. Most responders believe that regular exercise during pregnancy is safe for mother and baby (94%), would help prevent a decline in a pregnant persons mood (88%) and help to improve a pregnant persons mood (92%). The majority of responders (71%) were not aware of the WHO and Australian Government Department of Health recommendations for conducting exercise during pregnancy. 68% of responders conducted exercise during all or part of their most recent pregnancy. However, there was a significant association between a reported diagnosis of a mental illness during their lifetime and participation in structured exercise during pregnancy (p=0.009), with fewer individuals with a mental illness exercising during pregnancy compared to those without (61 vs 71%). Despite the majority of respondents participating in exercise during pregnancy, more than half of responders report conducting less exercise than that recommended by current guidelines. Fifty-seven percent of responders recall being advised to exercise during their most recent pregnancy, mostly by their GP (54%), midwife (46%) and obstetrician (38%). Walking was the most advised exercise type (80%) followed by swimming (46%). However, 69% of responders report receiving no or little advice from their healthcare provider about the safety and benefits of exercise during their most recent pregnancy, but 45% of responders felt satisfied about the advice they did receive. ConclusionThis study has shown that Australian women believe that exercise during pregnancy is safe and has benefits for mental health. However, many women report receiving little advice about this from their healthcare provider. Furthermore, women report not being aware of or meeting the WHO/National guidelines regarding exercise in pregnancy. Women do report primarily conducting low intensity exercise during pregnancy (walking, swimming, yoga). Importantly, fewer respondents with a diagnosed mental illness report exercising during pregnancy. Considering the potential benefits of exercise for mental illness, employing strategies to increase engagement with exercise during pregnancy is important. Further research to determine strategies to increase exercise in pregnant women, particularly those with a mental illness, are needed.\n",
