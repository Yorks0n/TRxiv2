Twinning is a partnership method that focuses on mutual transfer of knowledge and skills between two parties, including organisations, clinical practices, universities, or individual health professionals. In midwifery, twinning is a particularly important tool that can help countries with high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates to make connections with countries where sickness and death rates related to birth are lower and the role of midwives is better developed.">
