MethodAn anonymous online survey of women, administered via Qualtrics Australia, was open for 4 weeks between November - December 2021. The survey consisted of a 45-item questionnaire collecting data on demographics (including pregnancy status), attitudes/beliefs regarding conducting exercise during pregnancy, knowledge of exercise in pregnancy guidelines, exercise in pregnancy experience and mental health experiences of responders during pregnancy. Analysis of responses were restricted to those who have experienced a pregnancy. Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were calculated for all questions. Pearsons Chi-Squared tests were used to determine the differences in response by mental health status (p \u003c 0.05). ResultsThere were 695 eligible responses. Most responders believe that regular exercise during pregnancy is safe for mother and baby (94%), would help prevent a decline in a pregnant persons mood (88%) and help to improve a pregnant persons mood (92%). The majority of responders (71%) were not aware of the WHO and Australian Government Department of Health recommendations for conducting exercise during pregnancy. 68% of responders conducted exercise during all or part of their most recent pregnancy. However, there was a significant association between a reported diagnosis of a mental illness during their lifetime and participation in structured exercise during pregnancy (p=0.009), with fewer individuals with a mental illness exercising during pregnancy compared to those without (61 vs 71%). Despite the majority of respondents participating in exercise during pregnancy, more than half of responders report conducting less exercise than that recommended by current guidelines. Fifty-seven percent of responders recall being advised to exercise during their most recent pregnancy, mostly by their GP (54%), midwife (46%) and obstetrician (38%). Walking was the most advised exercise type (80%) followed by swimming (46%). However, 69% of responders report receiving no or little advice from their healthcare provider about the safety and benefits of exercise during their most recent pregnancy, but 45% of responders felt satisfied about the advice they did receive. ConclusionThis study has shown that Australian women believe that exercise during pregnancy is safe and has benefits for mental health. However, many women report receiving little advice about this from their healthcare provider. Furthermore, women report not being aware of or meeting the WHO/National guidelines regarding exercise in pregnancy. Women do report primarily conducting low intensity exercise during pregnancy (walking, swimming, yoga). Importantly, fewer respondents with a diagnosed mental illness report exercising during pregnancy. Considering the potential benefits of exercise for mental illness, employing strategies to increase engagement with exercise during pregnancy is important. Further research to determine strategies to increase exercise in pregnant women, particularly those with a mental illness, are needed.\nDietary Intake Is Associated With the Prevalence of Uterine Leiomyoma in Korean Women: A Retrospective Cohort Study\nAuthors: Kim, M.-J.; Kim, S.; Kim, J. J.; Kim, Y. S.; Song, J. H.; Lee, J. E.; Youn, J.; Yang, S. Y.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294524\nObjective: Uterine leiomyoma (UL), the most prevalent benign gynecologic tumor among reproductive-aged women, lacks sufficient research on the potential association between dietary intake and its occurrence in Korean women. Addressing this research gap, this study aims to evaluate the potential link between dietary intake and the prevalence of UL in Korean women. Methods : In this cross-sectional study, a cohort of 672 women, aged 25 to 65, were enrolled, with 383 (57%) being premenopausal. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and UL presence was determined through ultrasonography. The analysis focused exclusively on items within ten categories, including vegetables/fruit, vegetables, fruits, red meat, processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy product, milk, and alcohol. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to explore the relationship between dietary intake and the prevalence of UL, calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) while adjusting for confounding factors. Results : Within the total cohort, 219 (32.6%) women were diagnosed with UL. High intakes of fish and poultry showed an association with higher UL prevalence. Odds ratios (95% CIs) for the upper quartiles compared to the lower quartiles were 1.70 (1.02-2.84; p trend = 0.049) for fish intake and 1.85 (1.09 -3.14; p trend = 0.07) for poultry intake. Conversely, an inverse relationship emerged between dairy product intake and UL prevalence, with an odds ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.36-0.98; p trend = 0.06). Stratifying the analysis by menopausal status revealed a parallel pattern, with heightened UL prevalence with fish intake and reduced prevalence with dairy product intake. However, the link between poultry intake and UL prevalence was primarily observed among postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, elevated vegetable intake was linked to a decreased UL prevalence (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-1.01 for top vs. bottom quartiles; p trend = 0.01). Conclusion : We found that high consumption of fish and poultry, coupled with low intake of dairy products, correlated with an elevated prevalence of UL. Furthermore, vegetable intake exhibited an inverse relationship with UL prevalence, particularly among premenopausal women.\n",

Stratifying the analysis by menopausal status revealed a parallel pattern, with heightened UL prevalence with fish intake and reduced prevalence with dairy product intake. However, the link between poultry intake and UL prevalence was primarily observed among postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, elevated vegetable intake was linked to a decreased UL prevalence (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-1.01 for top vs. bottom quartiles; p trend = 0.01). Conclusion : We found that high consumption of fish and poultry, coupled with low intake of dairy products, correlated with an elevated prevalence of UL. Furthermore, vegetable intake exhibited an inverse relationship with UL prevalence, particularly among premenopausal women.</p>
