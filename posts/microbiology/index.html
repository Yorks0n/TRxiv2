As the pandemic progresses, it will be essential to test in near real time the potential of any new emerging variant to cause severe disease. BA.1 (Omicron) was shown to be attenuated compared to the previous VOCs like Delta, but it is possible that newly emerging variants may regain a virulent phenotype. Hamsters have been proven to be an exceedingly good model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to develop robust quantitative pipelines to assess the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. We used various approaches including RNAseq, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and digital pathology, including software assisted whole section imaging and downstream automatic analyses enhanced by machine learning, to develop methods to assess and quantify virus-induced pulmonary lesions in an unbiased manner. Initially, we used Delta and Omicron to develop our experimental pipelines. We then assessed the virulence of recent Omicron sub-lineages including BA.5, XBB, BQ.1.18, BA.2 and BA.2.75. We show that in experimentally infected hamsters, accurate quantification of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage infiltrates represent robust markers for assessing the extent of virus-induced pulmonary pathology, and hence virus virulence. In addition, using these pipelines, we could reveal how some Omicron sub-lineages (e.g., BA.2.75) have regained virulence compared to the original BA.1. Finally, to maximise the utility of the digital pathology pipelines reported in our study, we developed an online repository containing representative whole organ histopathology sections that can be visualised at variable magnifications (https://covid-atlas.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Overall, this pipeline can provide unbiased and invaluable data for rapidly assessing newly emerging variants and their potential to cause severe disease.\nEpigenetic liquid biopsies reveal elevated vascular endothelial cell turnover and erythropoiesis in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients\nAuthors: Ben Ami, R.; Loyfer, N.; Cohn, E.; Fialkoff, G.; Sharkia, I.; Bogot, N.; Kochan, D.; Kalak, G.; Jarjoui, A.; Chen-Shuali, C.; Azulai, H.; Barhoum, H.; Arish, N.; Greenberger, M. M.; Velleman, D.; Kurd, R.; Chetrit, E. B.; Bohm, D.; Wolak, T.; Quteineh, A.; Cann, G.; Glaser, B.; Friedman, N.; Kaplan, T.; Shemer, R.; Rokach, A.; Dor, Y.\nScore: 302.8, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550957\nThe full spectrum of tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for deciphering the heterogenous clinical course of COVID-19. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in circulating chromatin to assess cell type-specific turnover in severe and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, in relation to clinical outcome. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a massive elevation of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels, which originated in lung epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells and erythroblasts, suggesting increased cell death or turnover in these tissues. The immune response to infection was reflected by elevated B cell and monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels, and by evidence of an interferon response in cells prior to cfDNA release. Strikingly, monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels (but not monocyte counts), as well as lung epithelium cfDNA and vascular endothelial cfDNA, predicted clinical deterioration and duration of hospitalization. Asymptomatic patients had elevated levels of immune-derived cfDNA but did not show evidence of pulmonary or cardiac damage. Surprisingly, these patients showed elevated levels of vascular endothelial cell and erythroblast cfDNA, suggesting that sub-clinical vascular and erythrocyte turnover are universal features of COVID-19, independent of disease severity. Epigenetic liquid biopsies provide non-invasive means of monitoring COVID-19 patients, and reveal sub-clinical vascular damage and red blood cell turnover.\nAntiviral efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 XBB breakthrough infection sera against Omicron subvariants including EG.5\nAuthors: Kaku, Y.; Kosugi, Y.; Uriu, K.; Ito, J.; Kuramochi, J.; Sadamasu, K.; Yoshimura, K.; Asakura, H.; Nagashima, M.; The Genotype to Phenotype Japan (G2P-Japan) Consortium, ; Sato, K.\nScore: 142.6, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552415\nAs of July 2023, EG.5.1 (a.k.a. XBB.1.9.2.5.1), a XBB subvariant bearing the S:Q52H and S:F456L substitutions, alongside the S:F486P substitution (Figure S1A), has rapidly spread in some countries. On July 19, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant under monitoring. First, we showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a higher effective reproduction number compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2), suggesting that EG.5.1 will spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants in the near future. We then addressed whether EG.5.1 evades from the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infection (BTI) of XBB subvariants and performed a neutralization assay using XBB BTI sera. However, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of XBB BTI sera against EG.5.1 was comparable to those against XBB.1.5/1.9.2 and XBB.1.16. Moreover, the sensitivity of EG.5.1 to convalescent sera of XBB.1- and XBB.1.5-infected hamsters was similar to those of XBB.1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16. These results suggest that the increased Re of EG.5.1 is attributed to neither increased infectivity nor immune evasion from XBB BTI, and the emergence and spread of EG.5 is driven by the other pressures. We previously demonstrated that Omicron BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against the variant infected. In fact, the NT50s of the BTI sera of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 against the variant infected were 3.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold lower than that against the ancestral B.1.1 variant, respectively. However, strikingly, we found that the NT50 of the BTI sera of XBB1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16 against the variant infected were 8.7- and 8.3-fold lower than that against the B.1.1 variant. These results suggest that XBB BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against XBB subvariants.\nA patchwork pathway of apparently recent origin enables degradation of the synthetic buffer compound TRIS in bacteria\nAuthors: Holert, J.; Borker, A.; Nuebel, L. L.; Daniel, R.; Poehlein, A.; Philipp, B.\nScore: 44.1, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551466\nThe widely used synthetic chemical 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (TRIS) was long considered to be biologically inert. Herein, we describe a complete degradation pathway for the catabolism of TRIS in bacteria. By serendipity, Pseudomonas hunanensis Teo1 was isolated from sewage sludge and shown to be able to grow with TRIS as only carbon and nitrogen source. Genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses revealed two adjacent gene clusters embedded in a mobile genetic element on a conjugative plasmid to be upregulated during growth with TRIS. Conjugational transfer of this plasmid into P. putida KT2440 enabled this strain to grow with TRIS confirming that these clusters encode the complete TRIS degradation pathway. Heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli revealed cluster I to encode a TRIS uptake protein, a TRIS dehydrogenase, and a TRIS aldehyde dehydrogenase, which catalyze the oxidation of TRIS into 2-hydroxymethylserine. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the TRIS dehydrogenase proteins evolved from choline dehydrogenases. Genes encoded in cluster II encode a methylserine hydroxymethyltransferase and a D-serine dehydratase which could plausibly catalyze conversion of 2-hydroxymethylserine into pyruvate. Subsequent enrichments from wastewater purification systems led to the isolation of further TRIS-degrading bacteria from the Pseudomonas and Shinella genera which all carried the respective gene clusters in a similar genetic context as strain Teo1. Our data indicate that TRIS degradation evolved by gene assembly and enzyme adaptation from multiple independent metabolic pathways. Genomic database searches showed that TRIS degradation is now globally distributed, confirming its dissemination by horizontal gene transfer. Significance statementTRIS is a synthetic organic chemical that has been mass-produced since the 1950s and is now used in countless applications in industry, medicine, and households world-wide, in parts due to its presumed biological inertness. Our results challenge this common conception, showing that TRIS is biologically degradable by an apparently recently evolved pathway, providing insight into the evolution of metabolic pathways that make such ubiquitous chemicals available as growth substrates for bacteria. Such knowledge is valuable for developing new processes of wastewater purification in times of increasing water scarcity.\nBorg extrachromosomal elements of methane-oxidizing archaea have conserved and expressed genetic repertoires\nAuthors: Schoelmerich, M. C.; Ly, L.; West-Roberts, J.; Shi, L.-D.; Shen, C.; Malvankar, N.; Taib, N.; Gribaldo, S.; Woodcroft, B. J.; Al-Shayeb, B.; Dai, X.; Mozsary, C.; Hickey, S.; He, C.; Beaulaurier, J. A.; Juul, S.; Sachdeva, R.; Banfield, J.\nScore: 38.7, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.549754\nBorgs are huge extrachromosomal elements (ECE) of anaerobic methane-consuming \"Candidatus Methanoperedens\" archaea. Here, we used nanopore sequencing to validate published complete genomes curated from short reads and to reconstruct new genomes. 13 complete and four near-complete linear genomes share 40 genes that define a largely syntenous genome backbone. We use these conserved genes to identify new Borgs from peatland soil and to delineate Borg phylogeny, revealing two major clades. Remarkably, Borg genes encoding OmcZ nanowire-like electron-exporting cytochromes and cell surface proteins are more highly expressed than those of host Methanoperedens, indicating that Borgs augment the Methanoperedens activity in situ. We reconstructed the first complete 4.00 Mbp genome for a Methanoperedens that is inferred to be a Borg host and predicted its methylation motifs, which differ from pervasive TC and CC methylation motifs of the Borgs. Thus, methylation may enable Methanoperedens to distinguish their genomes from those of Borgs. Very high Borg to Methanoperedens ratios and structural predictions suggest that Borgs may be capable of encapsulation. The findings clearly define Borgs as a distinct class of ECE with shared genomic signatures, establish their diversification from a common ancestor with genetic inheritance, and raise the possibility of periodic existence outside of host cells.\nMissing microbial eukaryotes and misleading meta-omic conclusions\nAuthors: Krinos, A. I.; Mars Brisbin, M.; Hu, S. K.; Cohen, N. R.; Rynearson, T. A.; Follows, M. J.; Schulz, F.; Alexander, H.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551153\nMeta-omics has become commonplace in the study of microbial eukaryotes. The explosion of available data has inspired large-scale analyses, including species or taxonomic group distribution mapping, gene catalog construction, and inference on the functional roles and activities of microbial eukaryotes in situ. However, genome and transcriptome databases are prone to misannotation biases, and meta-omic inventories may have no recoverable taxonomic annotation for more than half of assembled contigs or predicted proteins. Direct mapping solely to organisms of interest might introduce a problematic misattribution bias, while full databases can annotate any cataloged organism but may be imbalanced between taxa. Here, we explore the potential pitfalls of common approaches to taxonomic annotation of protistan meta-omic datasets. We argue that ongoing curation of genetic resources is critical in accurately annotating protists in situ in meta-omic datasets. Moreover, we propose that precise taxonomic annotation of meta-omic data is a clustering problem rather than a feasible alignment problem. We show that taxonomic membership of sequence clusters demonstrates more accurate estimated community composition than returning exact sequence labels, and overlap between clusters can address database shortcomings. Clustering approaches can be applied to diverse environments while continuing to exploit the wealth of annotation data collated in databases, and database selection and evaluation is a critical part of correctly annotating protistan taxonomy in environmental datasets. We re-analyze three environmental datasets at three levels of taxonomic hierarchy in order to illustrate the critical importance of both database completeness and curation in enabling accurate environmental interpretation.\nInfant gut bacteriophage strain persistence during the first three years of life\nAuthors: Lou, Y. C.; Chen, L.; Borges, A. L.; West-Roberts, J. A.; Firek, B. A.; Morowitz, M.; Banfield, J.\nScore: 22.5, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552389\nBacteriophages are key components of gut microbiomes, yet the phage colonization process in the infant gut remains uncertain. Here, we established a large phage sequence database and used strain-resolved analyses to investigate phage succession in infants throughout the first three years of life. Analysis of 819 fecal metagenomes collected from 28 full-term and 24 preterm infants and their mothers revealed that early-life phageome richness increased over time and reached adult-like complexity by age three. Approximately 9% of early phage colonizers, mostly maternally transmitted and infecting Bacteroides, persisted for three years and were more prevalent in full-term than in preterm infants. Although rare, phages with stop codon reassignment were more likely to persist than non-recoded phages and generally displayed an increase in in-frame re-assigned stop codons over three years. Overall, maternal seeding, stop codon reassignment, host CRISPR-Cas locus prevalence, and diverse phage populations contribute to stable viral colonization.\nAnalyses of cell wall synthesis in Clostridioides difficile reveal a diversification in cell division mechanisms in endospore-forming bacteria\nAuthors: Shrestha, S.; Taib, N.; Gribaldo, S.; Shen, A.\nScore: 21.3, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552200\nCurrent models of bacterial cell division assume that the core synthases of the multiprotein divisome complex, FtsW-FtsI, are the primary drivers of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. These enzymes are typically encoded in the highly conserved division and cell wall (dcw) cluster and are considered to be universally essential for cell division. Here, we combine bioinformatics analyses with functional characterization in the pathogen Clostridioides difficile to show that dcw-encoded PG synthases have undergone a surprising specialization in the sole endospore-forming phylum, Firmicutes, to fulfill sporulation-specific roles. We describe a novel role for these enzymes in synthesizing septal PG during the sporulation-specific mode of cell division in C. difficile. Although these enzymes are directly regulated by canonical divisome components during this process, dcw-encoded PG synthases and their divisome regulators are unexpectedly dispensable for cell division during normal growth. Instead, C. difficile uses its sole bifunctional class A penicillin-binding protein (aPBP) to drive cell division, revealing a previously unreported role for this class of PG synthases as the core divisome enzyme. Collectively, our findings reveal how the emergence of endosporulation in the Firmicutes phylum was a key driver for the functional repurposing of an otherwise universally conserved cellular process such as cell division. Moreover, they indicate that C. difficile, and likely other clostridia, assemble a divisome that differs markedly from previously studied bacteria, thus representing an attractive, unique target for therapeutic purposes.\nThe host RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain is the anchor for replication of the influenza virus genome\nAuthors: Krischuns, T.; Arragain, B.; Isel, C.; Paisant, S.; Budt, M.; Wolff, T.; Cusack, S.; Naffakh, N.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551436\nThe current model is that the influenza virus polymerase (FluPol) binds either to host RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) or to the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), which drives its conformation and activity towards transcription or replication of the viral genome, respectively. Here, we provide evidence that the FluPol-RNAP II binding interface has a so far overlooked function for replication of the viral genome. Using a combination of cell-based and in vitro approaches, we show that the RNAP II C-terminal-domain, jointly with ANP32, enhances FluPol replication activity and we propose a model in which the host RNAP II is the anchor for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Our data open new perspectives on the spatial coupling of viral transcription and replication and the coordinated balance between these two activities.\nThe Feather Epithelium Contributes to the Dissemination and Ecology of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus in Ducks\nAuthors: Gaide, N.; Filaire, F.; Bertran, K.; Crispo, M.; Dirat, M.; Secula, A.; Foret-Lucas, C.; Payre, B.; Perlas, A.; Cantero, G.; Majo, N.; Soubies, S.; GUERIN, J.-L.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550633\nImmature feathers are known replication sites for high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) in poultry. However, it is unclear whether feathers play an active role in viral transmission. This study aims to investigate the contribution of the feather epithelium to the dissemination of clade 2.3.4.4b goose/Guangdong/1996 lineage H5 HPAIVs in the environment, based on natural and experimental infections of domestic ducks. During the 2016-22 outbreaks, H5 HPAIVs exhibited persistent and marked feather epitheliotropism in naturally infected commercial ducks. Infection of feathers resulted in epithelial necrosis, disruption, and the production and release of infectious virions. Viral and feather antigens colocalized in dust samples obtained from poultry barns housing naturally infected birds. In summary, the feather epithelium contributes to viral replication, and it is a likely source of environmental infectious material. This underestimated excretion route could greatly impact the ecology of HPAIVs, facilitating airborne and preening-related infections within a flock, and promoting prolonged viral infectivity and long-distance viral transmission between poultry farms.

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to multiple variants of concern (VOCs) with different biological properties. As the pandemic progresses, it will be essential to test in near real time the potential of any new emerging variant to cause severe disease. BA.1 (Omicron) was shown to be attenuated compared to the previous VOCs like Delta, but it is possible that newly emerging variants may regain a virulent phenotype. Hamsters have been proven to be an exceedingly good model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to develop robust quantitative pipelines to assess the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. We used various approaches including RNAseq, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and digital pathology, including software assisted whole section imaging and downstream automatic analyses enhanced by machine learning, to develop methods to assess and quantify virus-induced pulmonary lesions in an unbiased manner. Initially, we used Delta and Omicron to develop our experimental pipelines. We then assessed the virulence of recent Omicron sub-lineages including BA.5, XBB, BQ.1.18, BA.2 and BA.2.75. We show that in experimentally infected hamsters, accurate quantification of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage infiltrates represent robust markers for assessing the extent of virus-induced pulmonary pathology, and hence virus virulence. In addition, using these pipelines, we could reveal how some Omicron sub-lineages (e.g., BA.2.75) have regained virulence compared to the original BA.1. Finally, to maximise the utility of the digital pathology pipelines reported in our study, we developed an online repository containing representative whole organ histopathology sections that can be visualised at variable magnifications (https://covid-atlas.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Overall, this pipeline can provide unbiased and invaluable data for rapidly assessing newly emerging variants and their potential to cause severe disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The full spectrum of tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for deciphering the heterogenous clinical course of COVID-19. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in circulating chromatin to assess cell type-specific turnover in severe and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, in relation to clinical outcome. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a massive elevation of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels, which originated in lung epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells and erythroblasts, suggesting increased cell death or turnover in these tissues. The immune response to infection was reflected by elevated B cell and monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels, and by evidence of an interferon response in cells prior to cfDNA release. Strikingly, monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels (but not monocyte counts), as well as lung epithelium cfDNA and vascular endothelial cfDNA, predicted clinical deterioration and duration of hospitalization. Asymptomatic patients had elevated levels of immune-derived cfDNA but did not show evidence of pulmonary or cardiac damage. Surprisingly, these patients showed elevated levels of vascular endothelial cell and erythroblast cfDNA, suggesting that sub-clinical vascular and erythrocyte turnover are universal features of COVID-19, independent of disease severity. Epigenetic liquid biopsies provide non-invasive means of monitoring COVID-19 patients, and reveal sub-clinical vascular damage and red blood cell turnover.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As of July 2023, EG.5.1 (a.k.a. XBB.1.9.2.5.1), a XBB subvariant bearing the S:Q52H and S:F456L substitutions, alongside the S:F486P substitution (Figure S1A), has rapidly spread in some countries. On July 19, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant under monitoring. First, we showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a higher effective reproduction number compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2), suggesting that EG.5.1 will spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants in the near future. We then addressed whether EG.5.1 evades from the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infection (BTI) of XBB subvariants and performed a neutralization assay using XBB BTI sera. However, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of XBB BTI sera against EG.5.1 was comparable to those against XBB.1.5/1.9.2 and XBB.1.16. Moreover, the sensitivity of EG.5.1 to convalescent sera of XBB.1- and XBB.1.5-infected hamsters was similar to those of XBB.1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16. These results suggest that the increased Re of EG.5.1 is attributed to neither increased infectivity nor immune evasion from XBB BTI, and the emergence and spread of EG.5 is driven by the other pressures. We previously demonstrated that Omicron BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against the variant infected. In fact, the NT50s of the BTI sera of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 against the variant infected were 3.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold lower than that against the ancestral B.1.1 variant, respectively. However, strikingly, we found that the NT50 of the BTI sera of XBB1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16 against the variant infected were 8.7- and 8.3-fold lower than that against the B.1.1 variant. These results suggest that XBB BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against XBB subvariants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The widely used synthetic chemical 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (TRIS) was long considered to be biologically inert. Herein, we describe a complete degradation pathway for the catabolism of TRIS in bacteria. By serendipity, Pseudomonas hunanensis Teo1 was isolated from sewage sludge and shown to be able to grow with TRIS as only carbon and nitrogen source. Genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses revealed two adjacent gene clusters embedded in a mobile genetic element on a conjugative plasmid to be upregulated during growth with TRIS. Conjugational transfer of this plasmid into P. putida KT2440 enabled this strain to grow with TRIS confirming that these clusters encode the complete TRIS degradation pathway. Heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli revealed cluster I to encode a TRIS uptake protein, a TRIS dehydrogenase, and a TRIS aldehyde dehydrogenase, which catalyze the oxidation of TRIS into 2-hydroxymethylserine. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the TRIS dehydrogenase proteins evolved from choline dehydrogenases. Genes encoded in cluster II encode a methylserine hydroxymethyltransferase and a D-serine dehydratase which could plausibly catalyze conversion of 2-hydroxymethylserine into pyruvate. Subsequent enrichments from wastewater purification systems led to the isolation of further TRIS-degrading bacteria from the Pseudomonas and Shinella genera which all carried the respective gene clusters in a similar genetic context as strain Teo1.

Our data indicate that TRIS degradation evolved by gene assembly and enzyme adaptation from multiple independent metabolic pathways. Genomic database searches showed that TRIS degradation is now globally distributed, confirming its dissemination by horizontal gene transfer.

Significance statementTRIS is a synthetic organic chemical that has been mass-produced since the 1950s and is now used in countless applications in industry, medicine, and households world-wide, in parts due to its presumed biological inertness. Our results challenge this common conception, showing that TRIS is biologically degradable by an apparently recently evolved pathway, providing insight into the evolution of metabolic pathways that make such ubiquitous chemicals available as growth substrates for bacteria. Such knowledge is valuable for developing new processes of wastewater purification in times of increasing water scarcity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Borgs are huge extrachromosomal elements (ECE) of anaerobic methane-consuming &#34;Candidatus Methanoperedens&#34; archaea. Here, we used nanopore sequencing to validate published complete genomes curated from short reads and to reconstruct new genomes. 13 complete and four near-complete linear genomes share 40 genes that define a largely syntenous genome backbone. We use these conserved genes to identify new Borgs from peatland soil and to delineate Borg phylogeny, revealing two major clades. Remarkably, Borg genes encoding OmcZ nanowire-like electron-exporting cytochromes and cell surface proteins are more highly expressed than those of host Methanoperedens, indicating that Borgs augment the Methanoperedens activity in situ. We reconstructed the first complete 4.00 Mbp genome for a Methanoperedens that is inferred to be a Borg host and predicted its methylation motifs, which differ from pervasive TC and CC methylation motifs of the Borgs. Thus, methylation may enable Methanoperedens to distinguish their genomes from those of Borgs. Very high Borg to Methanoperedens ratios and structural predictions suggest that Borgs may be capable of encapsulation. The findings clearly define Borgs as a distinct class of ECE with shared genomic signatures, establish their diversification from a common ancestor with genetic inheritance, and raise the possibility of periodic existence outside of host cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Meta-omics has become commonplace in the study of microbial eukaryotes. The explosion of available data has inspired large-scale analyses, including species or taxonomic group distribution mapping, gene catalog construction, and inference on the functional roles and activities of microbial eukaryotes in situ. However, genome and transcriptome databases are prone to misannotation biases, and meta-omic inventories may have no recoverable taxonomic annotation for more than half of assembled contigs or predicted proteins. Direct mapping solely to organisms of interest might introduce a problematic misattribution bias, while full databases can annotate any cataloged organism but may be imbalanced between taxa. Here, we explore the potential pitfalls of common approaches to taxonomic annotation of protistan meta-omic datasets. We argue that ongoing curation of genetic resources is critical in accurately annotating protists in situ in meta-omic datasets. Moreover, we propose that precise taxonomic annotation of meta-omic data is a clustering problem rather than a feasible alignment problem. We show that taxonomic membership of sequence clusters demonstrates more accurate estimated community composition than returning exact sequence labels, and overlap between clusters can address database shortcomings. Clustering approaches can be applied to diverse environments while continuing to exploit the wealth of annotation data collated in databases, and database selection and evaluation is a critical part of correctly annotating protistan taxonomy in environmental datasets. We re-analyze three environmental datasets at three levels of taxonomic hierarchy in order to illustrate the critical importance of both database completeness and curation in enabling accurate environmental interpretation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacteriophages are key components of gut microbiomes, yet the phage colonization process in the infant gut remains uncertain. Here, we established a large phage sequence database and used strain-resolved analyses to investigate phage succession in infants throughout the first three years of life. Analysis of 819 fecal metagenomes collected from 28 full-term and 24 preterm infants and their mothers revealed that early-life phageome richness increased over time and reached adult-like complexity by age three. Approximately 9% of early phage colonizers, mostly maternally transmitted and infecting Bacteroides, persisted for three years and were more prevalent in full-term than in preterm infants. Although rare, phages with stop codon reassignment were more likely to persist than non-recoded phages and generally displayed an increase in in-frame re-assigned stop codons over three years. Overall, maternal seeding, stop codon reassignment, host CRISPR-Cas locus prevalence, and diverse phage populations contribute to stable viral colonization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current models of bacterial cell division assume that the core synthases of the multiprotein divisome complex, FtsW-FtsI, are the primary drivers of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. These enzymes are typically encoded in the highly conserved division and cell wall (dcw) cluster and are considered to be universally essential for cell division. Here, we combine bioinformatics analyses with functional characterization in the pathogen Clostridioides difficile to show that dcw-encoded PG synthases have undergone a surprising specialization in the sole endospore-forming phylum, Firmicutes, to fulfill sporulation-specific roles. We describe a novel role for these enzymes in synthesizing septal PG during the sporulation-specific mode of cell division in C. difficile. Although these enzymes are directly regulated by canonical divisome components during this process, dcw-encoded PG synthases and their divisome regulators are unexpectedly dispensable for cell division during normal growth. Instead, C. difficile uses its sole bifunctional class A penicillin-binding protein (aPBP) to drive cell division, revealing a previously unreported role for this class of PG synthases as the core divisome enzyme. Collectively, our findings reveal how the emergence of endosporulation in the Firmicutes phylum was a key driver for the functional repurposing of an otherwise universally conserved cellular process such as cell division. Moreover, they indicate that C. difficile, and likely other clostridia, assemble a divisome that differs markedly from previously studied bacteria, thus representing an attractive, unique target for therapeutic purposes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The current model is that the influenza virus polymerase (FluPol) binds either to host RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) or to the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), which drives its conformation and activity towards transcription or replication of the viral genome, respectively. Here, we provide evidence that the FluPol-RNAP II binding interface has a so far overlooked function for replication of the viral genome. Using a combination of cell-based and in vitro approaches, we show that the RNAP II C-terminal-domain, jointly with ANP32, enhances FluPol replication activity and we propose a model in which the host RNAP II is the anchor for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Our data open new perspectives on the spatial coupling of viral transcription and replication and the coordinated balance between these two activities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Immature feathers are known replication sites for high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) in poultry. However, it is unclear whether feathers play an active role in viral transmission. This study aims to investigate the contribution of the feather epithelium to the dissemination of clade 2.3.4.4b goose/Guangdong/1996 lineage H5 HPAIVs in the environment, based on natural and experimental infections of domestic ducks. During the 2016-22 outbreaks, H5 HPAIVs exhibited persistent and marked feather epitheliotropism in naturally infected commercial ducks. Infection of feathers resulted in epithelial necrosis, disruption, and the production and release of infectious virions. Viral and feather antigens colocalized in dust samples obtained from poultry barns housing naturally infected birds. In summary, the feather epithelium contributes to viral replication, and it is a likely source of environmental infectious material. This underestimated excretion route could greatly impact the ecology of HPAIVs, facilitating airborne and preening-related infections within a flock, and promoting prolonged viral infectivity and long-distance viral transmission between poultry farms.
