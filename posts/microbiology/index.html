  "articleBody": " Genomic epidemiology of European Aspergillus fumigatus causing COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in Europe\nAuthors: Simmons, B.; Rhodes, J.; Rogers, T.; Talento, A. F.; Griffin, A.; Mansfield, M.; Abdolrasouli, A.; Verweij, P. E.; Bosch, T.; Schelenz, S.; Hemmings, S.; Sheehan, D.; Fisher, M. C.\nScore: 37.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550109\nThe opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus has been found to cause coinfections in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, leading to COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). The CAPA all-cause mortality rate is approximately 50% and may be complicated by azole-resistance. Genomic epidemiology can help shed light on the genetics of A. fumigatus causing CAPA including the prevalence of alleles that are associated with azole-resistance. Here, a population genomic analysis of 21 CAPA isolates from four European countries is presented. The CAPA isolates were compared with A. fumigatus from a wider population of 167 non-CAPA clinical isolates and 73 environmental isolates. Bioinformatic analysis and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed to quantify resistance and identify possible genetically-encoded azole-resistant mechanisms. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 CAPA isolates showed a lack of genetic distinction from the wider A. fumigatus population, with isolates distributed within two distinct clades (A and B), with the majority of the CAPA isolates in clade B (71.4%). The prevalence of phenotypic azole-resistance in CAPA was 14.3% (n=3/21); all three CAPA isolates contained a known resistance-associated cyp51A polymorphism. CAPA isolates are drawn from the wider A. fumigatus population rather than forming a unique genetic background showing that COVID-19 patients are susceptible to the entire A. fumigatus population. However, the relatively high prevalence of azole-resistance alleles that we document poses a threat to treatment success rates, warranting enhanced detection and surveillance of A. fumigatus genotypes in these patients. Furthermore, potential changes to antifungal first-line treatment guidelines may be needed to improve patient outcomes.\nEvolution and spread of a persistent P. aeruginosa outbreak clone over decades in a single US hospital.\nAuthors: Stribling, W.; Hall, L. R.; Powell, A.; Harless, C.; Martin, M. J.; Corey, B. W.; Snesrud, E.; Ong, A.; Maybank, R.; Stam, J.; Bartlett, K.; Jones, B. T.; Preston, L. N.; Lane, K. F.; Thompson, B.; Young, L. M.; Kwak, Y. I.; Barsoumian, A. E.; Markelz, A.-E.; Kiley, J. L.; Cybulski, R. J.; Bennett, J. W.; Mc Gann, P. T.; Lebreton, F.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550326\nWhole-genome sequencing is revolutionizing outbreak investigation. In 2020, prospective and retrospective surveillance detected a P. aeruginosa outbreak with 254 isolates collected from 82 patients in 27 wards of a hospital. Its origin was dated to the late 90s, just after the facility opened, and patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient cases of transmission were inferred. Over time, two epidemic subclones evolved in separate hosts and hospital areas, including newly opened wards, and hospital-wide sampling confirmed reservoirs persisted in the plumbing. Pathoadaptive mutations in genes associated with virulence, cell wall biogenesis, and antibiotic resistance were identified. While the latter correlated with the acquisition of phenotypic resistances to 1st (cephalosporin), 2nd (carbapenems) and 3rd (colistin) lines of treatment, maximum parsimony suggested that a truncation in a lipopolysaccharide component coincided with the emergence of a subclone prevalent in chronic infections. Since initial identification, extensive infection control efforts have proved successful at slowing transmission.\nAn interbacterial lipase toxin with an unprecedented reverse domain arrangement defines a new class of type VII secretion system effector\nAuthors: Garrett, S. R.; Mietrach, N.; Deme, J.; Bitzer, A.; Yang, Y.; Ulhuq, F. R.; Kretschmer, D.; Heilbronner, S.; Smith, T. K.; Lea, S. M.; Palmer, T.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551094\nThe type VII protein secretion system (T7SS) is found in many Gram-positive bacteria and in pathogenic mycobacteria. All T7SS substrate proteins described to date share a common helical domain architecture at the N-terminus that typically interacts with other helical partner proteins, forming a composite signal sequence for targeting to the T7SS. The C-terminal domains are functionally diverse and in Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus often specify toxic anti-bacterial activity. Here we describe the first example of a new class of T7 substrate, TslA, that has an unexpected reverse domain organisation. TslA is widely found across Bacillota including Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Listeria. We show that the S. aureus TslA N-terminal domain is a phospholipase A with anti-staphylococcal activity that is neutralised by the immunity lipoprotein TilA. Two small helical partner proteins, TlaA1 and TlaA2 are essential for T7-dependent secretion of TslA and at least one of these interacts with the TslA C-terminal domain to form a helical stack. Cryo-EM analysis of purified TslA complexes indicate that they share structural similarity with canonical T7 substrates. Our findings suggest that the T7SS has the extraordinary feature of recognising a secretion signal present at either end of a substrate.\nButyrate Protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced Tissue Damage in Golden Hamsters.\nAuthors: Yu, H.; Yuan, L.; Yan, Z.; Zhou, M.; Ye, J.; Wu, K.; Chen, W.; Chen, R.; Xia, N.-S.; Guan, Y.; Zhu, H.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550811\nButyrate, produced by gut microbe during dietary fiber fermentation, plays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in chronic inflammation diseases, yet it remains to be explored whether butyrate has protective effects against viral infections. Here, we demonstrated that butyrate alleviated tissue injury in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected golden hamsters with supplementation of butyrate before and during the infection. Butyrate-treated hamsters showed augmentation of type I interferon (IFN) response and activation of endothelial cells without exaggerated inflammation. In addition, butyrate regulated redox homeostasis by enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to inhibit excessive apoptotic cell death. Therefore, butyrate exhibited an effective prevention against SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating antiviral immune responses and promoting cell survival. IMPORTANCESince SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans, it is essential to develop therapeutics based on relieving such severe clinical symptoms. Current therapy strategies mainly focus on individuals who have COVID-19, however, there is still a strong need for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study showed that butyrate, a bacterial metabolite, improved the response of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters by reducing immunopathology caused by impaired antiviral defenses and inhibiting excessive apoptosis through reduction in oxidative stress.\nFirst Eurasian cases of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a free-ranging urban population of wild fallow deer\nAuthors: Purves, K.; Brown, H.; Haverty, R.; Ryan, A.; Griffin, L.; McCormack, J.; O'Reilly, S. R.; Mallon, P. W.; Gautier, V.; Cassidy, J. P.; Fabre, A.; Carr, M. J.; Gonzalez, G.; Ciuti, S.; Fletcher, N.\nScore: 77.4, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.547941\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects wildlife. Recent studies highlighted that variants of concern (VOC) may expand into novel animal reservoirs with the potential for reverse zoonosis. North American white-tailed deer are the only deer species in which SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, raising the question whether further reservoir species exist as new VOC emerge. Here, we report the first cases of deer SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in Eurasia, in a city population of fallow deer in Dublin, Ireland. Deer were seronegative in 2020 (circulating variant in humans: Alpha), one animal was seropositive in 2021 (Delta variant), and 57% of animals tested in 2022 were seropositive (Omicron variant). Ex vivo, a clinical isolate of Omicron BA.1 infected fallow deer precision cut lung slice type-2 pneumocytes, also a major target of infection in human lungs. Our findings suggest a change in host tropism as new variants emerged in the human reservoir, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife disease monitoring and limiting human-wildlife contacts. Teaser: This study is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in fallow deer, highlighting expansion of viral variants into new host reservoirs.\nWall teichoic acid substitution with glucose governs phage susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis\nAuthors: Beck, C. R.; Krusche, J.; Notaro, A.; Walter, A.; Krankel, L.; Vollert, A.; Stemmler, R.; Wittmann, J.; Schaller, M.; Slavetinsky, C. J.; Mayer, C.; De Castro, C.; Peschel, A.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550822\nThe species- and clone-specific susceptibility of Staphylococcus cells for bacteriophages is governed by the structures and glycosylation patterns of wall teichoic acid (WTA) glycopolymers. The glycocodes of phage-WTA interaction in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis and in other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have remained unknown. We report a new S. epidermidis WTA glycosyltransferase TagE whose deletion confers resistance to siphoviruses such as Phi;E72 but enables binding of otherwise unbound podoviruses. S. epidermidis glycerolphosphate WTA was found to be modified with glucose in a tagE-dependent manner. TagE is encoded together with the enzymes PgcA and GtaB providing uridine diphosphate-activated glucose. Phi;E72 transduced several other CoNS species encoding TagE homologs suggesting that WTA glycosylation via TagE is a frequent trait among CoNS that permits inter-species horizontal gene transfer. Our study unravels a crucial mechanism of phage-Staphylococcus interaction and of horizontal gene transfer and it will help in the design of anti-staphylococcal phage therapies.\nCommunity structure of known and previously unknown endobacteria associated with spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.\nAuthors: Lastovetsky, O. A.; Caruso, T.; Brennan, F.; Wall, D.; Pylni, S.; Doyle, E.\nScore: 13.3, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550273\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous plant root symbionts which can house two endobacteria: Ca. Moeniiplasma glomeromycotorum (CaMg) and Ca. Glomeribacter gigasporarum (CaGg). However, little is known about their distribution and population structure in natural AMF populations and whether AMF can harbour other endobacteria. We isolated AMF from two environments and surveyed the surface-sterilized spores for endobacteria. We found that CaMg and CaGg differed significantly in distribution whereby CaMg were extremely abundant (80%) and CaGg were extremely rare (2%) in both environments. Unexpectedly, we discovered an additional and previously unknown level of bacterial diversity within AMF spores which extended beyond the known endosymbionts, with as many as 277 other bacterial taxa detected in individual spores. Detailed analysis of endobacterial communities inside AMF spores revealed that: (i)CaGg were not limited in distribution to the Gigasporacea family of AMF, as previously thought, (ii) CaMg community structure was driven by AMF host genotype, (iii) a significant inverse correlation existed between the diversity of CaMg and diversity of all other endobacteria. The latter suggests the existence of competition dynamics between different bacterial populations inside AMF spores and provides a basis for generation of testable hypotheses regarding the function of CaMg in AMF biology.\nBacterial cGAS-like enzymes produce 2',3'-cGAMP to activate an ion channel that restricts phage replication\nAuthors: Tak, U.; Walth, P.; Whiteley, A. T.\nScore: 44.7, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550367\nThe mammalian innate immune system uses cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to synthesize the cyclic dinucleotide 2',3'-cGAMP during antiviral and antitumor immune responses. 2',3'-cGAMP is a nucleotide second messenger that initiates inflammatory signaling by binding to and activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) receptor. Bacteria also encode cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) that produce nucleotide second messengers to initiate antiviral (antiphage) signaling. Bacterial CD-NTases produce a wide range of cyclic oligonucleotides but have not been documented to produce 2',3'-cGAMP. Here we discovered bacterial CD-NTases that produce 2',3'-cGAMP to restrict phage replication. Bacterial 2',3'-cGAMP binds to CD-NTase associated protein 14 (Cap14), a transmembrane protein of unknown function. Using electrophysiology, we show that Cap14 is a chloride-selective ion channel that is activated by 2',3'-cGAMP binding. Cap14 adopts a modular architecture, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal nucleotide-binding SAVED domain. Domain-swapping experiments demonstrated the Cap14 transmembrane region could be substituted with a nuclease, thereby generating a biosensor that is selective for 2',3'-cGAMP. This study reveals that 2',3'-cGAMP signaling extends beyond metazoa to bacteria. Further, our findings suggest that transmembrane proteins of unknown function in bacterial immune pathways may broadly function as nucleotide-gated ion channels.\nDiversity and biotechnological potential of filamentous fungi isolated from sediments of Basque estuaries\nAuthors: Otamendi, A.; Agirrezabala, Z.; Perez-Cruz, C.; Liebana, R.; Berregi, I.; Alonso-Saez, L.; Duenas, M. T.; Lanzen, A.; Etxebeste, O.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550687\nMarine environments harbor a vast diversity of microorganisms, which have developed multiple strategies to adapt to stress conditions such as high salt concentrations and nutrient scarcity and, thus, are a source of natural products and high-value enzymes, as they have the ability to degrade complex polymeric substrates. These features make marine microorganisms a valuable source for the development of new biotechnological tools. Here, we focused on the isolation of filamentous fungi, using sediment samples collected from estuaries of the Basque Country in the Bay of Biscay. The phenotype of these isolates was characterized based on the potential to grow on complex marine polysaccharides or to secrete pigments to the culture medium. Based on this screening, the genomes of two isolates of the order Hypocreales, Marquandomyces marquandii and Albophoma yamanashiensis, were sequenced and are described here for the first time. The analysis of their CAZYme (carbohydrate-active enzyme) and secondary metabolite gene-cluster repertoires suggest that these estuarine isolates could be used as a source of novel enzymatic activities and secondary metabolites. One-sentence summaryIsolation and characterization of filamentous fungi from sediments of Basque estuaries and an assessment of their biotechnological potential. ImportanceMarine microbes are considered an unlimited source of molecules for biotechnology in fields such as pharmaceutics, biomedicine, cosmetics, nutraceutics, food, feed or agriculture. Thus, it is believed that blue biotechnology will make a significant contribution to the sustainability of global economy. However, the study of marine fungi lags behind that of marine bacteria and it is considered that the potential impact of fungi at the biotechnological level is underestimated. In this work, filamentous fungi from sediment samples of estuaries of the Basque Country have been isolated and the genomes of the Sordariomycete fungi Marquandomyces marquandii and Albophoma yamanashiensis sequenced and analyzed. Their characterization will contribute to the inventory of the genomic diversity within filamentous fungi and the identification of species and activities with biotechnological potential.\nThe fate of bacterial secondary metabolites in the rhizosphere: Streptomyces degrades and feeds on cyclic lipopeptides produced by competitors\nAuthors: Rigolet, A.; Arguelles Arias, A.; Anckaert, A.; Quinton, L.; Rigali, S.; Tellatin, D.; Burguet, P.; Ongena, M.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550914\nCyclic lipopeptides are key bioactive secondary metabolites produced by some plant beneficial rhizobacteria such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus. They exhibit antimicrobial properties, promote induced systemic resistance in plants and support key developmental traits including motility, biofilm formation and root colonization. However, our knowledge about the fate of lipopeptides once released in the environment and especially upon contact with neighboring rhizobacteria remains limited. Here, we investigated the enzymatic degradation of Bacillus and Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides by Streptomyces venezuelae. We observed that Streptomyces is able to degrade the three lipopeptides surfactin, iturin and fengycin upon confrontation with of B. velezensis in vitro and in planta according to specific mechanisms. S. venezuelae was also able to degrade the structurally diverse sessilin, tolaasin, orfamide, xantholisin and putisolvin-type lipopeptides produced by Pseudomonas, indicating that this trait is likely engage in the interaction with various competitors.Furthermore, the degradation of CLPs is associated with the release of free amino and fatty acids and was found to enhance Streptomyces growth, indicating a possible nutritional utilization. Thereby, this work stresses on how the enzymatic arsenal of S. venezuelae may contribute to its adaptation to BSMs-driven interactions with microbial competitors. The ability of Streptomyces to degrade exogenous lipopeptides and feed on them adds a new facet to the implications of the degradation of those compounds by Streptomyces, where linearization of surfactin was previously reported as a detoxification mechanism. Additionally, we hypothesize that lipopeptide-producing rhizobacteria and their biocontrol potential are impacted by the degradation of their lipopeptides as observed with the polarized motility of B. velezensis, avoiding the confrontation zone with Streptomyces and the loss of antifungal properties of degraded iturin. This work illustrates how CLPs, once released in the environment, may rapidly be remodeled or degraded by members of the bacterial community, with potential impacts on CLP-producing rhizobacteria and the biocontrol products derived from them.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus has been found to cause coinfections in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, leading to COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). The CAPA all-cause mortality rate is approximately 50% and may be complicated by azole-resistance. Genomic epidemiology can help shed light on the genetics of A. fumigatus causing CAPA including the prevalence of alleles that are associated with azole-resistance. Here, a population genomic analysis of 21 CAPA isolates from four European countries is presented. The CAPA isolates were compared with A. fumigatus from a wider population of 167 non-CAPA clinical isolates and 73 environmental isolates. Bioinformatic analysis and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed to quantify resistance and identify possible genetically-encoded azole-resistant mechanisms. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 CAPA isolates showed a lack of genetic distinction from the wider A. fumigatus population, with isolates distributed within two distinct clades (A and B), with the majority of the CAPA isolates in clade B (71.4%). The prevalence of phenotypic azole-resistance in CAPA was 14.3% (n=3/21); all three CAPA isolates contained a known resistance-associated cyp51A polymorphism. CAPA isolates are drawn from the wider A. fumigatus population rather than forming a unique genetic background showing that COVID-19 patients are susceptible to the entire A. fumigatus population. However, the relatively high prevalence of azole-resistance alleles that we document poses a threat to treatment success rates, warranting enhanced detection and surveillance of A. fumigatus genotypes in these patients. Furthermore, potential changes to antifungal first-line treatment guidelines may be needed to improve patient outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whole-genome sequencing is revolutionizing outbreak investigation. In 2020, prospective and retrospective surveillance detected a P. aeruginosa outbreak with 254 isolates collected from 82 patients in 27 wards of a hospital. Its origin was dated to the late 90s, just after the facility opened, and patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient cases of transmission were inferred. Over time, two epidemic subclones evolved in separate hosts and hospital areas, including newly opened wards, and hospital-wide sampling confirmed reservoirs persisted in the plumbing. Pathoadaptive mutations in genes associated with virulence, cell wall biogenesis, and antibiotic resistance were identified. While the latter correlated with the acquisition of phenotypic resistances to 1st (cephalosporin), 2nd (carbapenems) and 3rd (colistin) lines of treatment, maximum parsimony suggested that a truncation in a lipopolysaccharide component coincided with the emergence of a subclone prevalent in chronic infections. Since initial identification, extensive infection control efforts have proved successful at slowing transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The type VII protein secretion system (T7SS) is found in many Gram-positive bacteria and in pathogenic mycobacteria. All T7SS substrate proteins described to date share a common helical domain architecture at the N-terminus that typically interacts with other helical partner proteins, forming a composite signal sequence for targeting to the T7SS. The C-terminal domains are functionally diverse and in Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus often specify toxic anti-bacterial activity. Here we describe the first example of a new class of T7 substrate, TslA, that has an unexpected reverse domain organisation. TslA is widely found across Bacillota including Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Listeria. We show that the S. aureus TslA N-terminal domain is a phospholipase A with anti-staphylococcal activity that is neutralised by the immunity lipoprotein TilA. Two small helical partner proteins, TlaA1 and TlaA2 are essential for T7-dependent secretion of TslA and at least one of these interacts with the TslA C-terminal domain to form a helical stack. Cryo-EM analysis of purified TslA complexes indicate that they share structural similarity with canonical T7 substrates. Our findings suggest that the T7SS has the extraordinary feature of recognising a secretion signal present at either end of a substrate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Butyrate, produced by gut microbe during dietary fiber fermentation, plays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in chronic inflammation diseases, yet it remains to be explored whether butyrate has protective effects against viral infections. Here, we demonstrated that butyrate alleviated tissue injury in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected golden hamsters with supplementation of butyrate before and during the infection. Butyrate-treated hamsters showed augmentation of type I interferon (IFN) response and activation of endothelial cells without exaggerated inflammation. In addition, butyrate regulated redox homeostasis by enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to inhibit excessive apoptotic cell death. Therefore, butyrate exhibited an effective prevention against SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating antiviral immune responses and promoting cell survival.

IMPORTANCESince SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans, it is essential to develop therapeutics based on relieving such severe clinical symptoms. Current therapy strategies mainly focus on individuals who have COVID-19, however, there is still a strong need for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study showed that butyrate, a bacterial metabolite, improved the response of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters by reducing immunopathology caused by impaired antiviral defenses and inhibiting excessive apoptosis through reduction in oxidative stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects wildlife. Recent studies highlighted that variants of concern (VOC) may expand into novel animal reservoirs with the potential for reverse zoonosis. North American white-tailed deer are the only deer species in which SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, raising the question whether further reservoir species exist as new VOC emerge. Here, we report the first cases of deer SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in Eurasia, in a city population of fallow deer in Dublin, Ireland. Deer were seronegative in 2020 (circulating variant in humans: Alpha), one animal was seropositive in 2021 (Delta variant), and 57% of animals tested in 2022 were seropositive (Omicron variant). Ex vivo, a clinical isolate of Omicron BA.1 infected fallow deer precision cut lung slice type-2 pneumocytes, also a major target of infection in human lungs. Our findings suggest a change in host tropism as new variants emerged in the human reservoir, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife disease monitoring and limiting human-wildlife contacts.

Teaser: This study is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in fallow deer, highlighting expansion of viral variants into new host reservoirs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The species- and clone-specific susceptibility of Staphylococcus cells for bacteriophages is governed by the structures and glycosylation patterns of wall teichoic acid (WTA) glycopolymers. The glycocodes of phage-WTA interaction in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis and in other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have remained unknown. We report a new S. epidermidis WTA glycosyltransferase TagE whose deletion confers resistance to siphoviruses such as Phi;E72 but enables binding of otherwise unbound podoviruses. S. epidermidis glycerolphosphate WTA was found to be modified with glucose in a tagE-dependent manner. TagE is encoded together with the enzymes PgcA and GtaB providing uridine diphosphate-activated glucose. Phi;E72 transduced several other CoNS species encoding TagE homologs suggesting that WTA glycosylation via TagE is a frequent trait among CoNS that permits inter-species horizontal gene transfer. Our study unravels a crucial mechanism of phage-Staphylococcus interaction and of horizontal gene transfer and it will help in the design of anti-staphylococcal phage therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous plant root symbionts which can house two endobacteria: Ca. Moeniiplasma glomeromycotorum (CaMg) and Ca. Glomeribacter gigasporarum (CaGg). However, little is known about their distribution and population structure in natural AMF populations and whether AMF can harbour other endobacteria. We isolated AMF from two environments and surveyed the surface-sterilized spores for endobacteria. We found that CaMg and CaGg differed significantly in distribution whereby CaMg were extremely abundant (80%) and CaGg were extremely rare (2%) in both environments. Unexpectedly, we discovered an additional and previously unknown level of bacterial diversity within AMF spores which extended beyond the known endosymbionts, with as many as 277 other bacterial taxa detected in individual spores. Detailed analysis of endobacterial communities inside AMF spores revealed that: (i)CaGg were not limited in distribution to the Gigasporacea family of AMF, as previously thought, (ii) CaMg community structure was driven by AMF host genotype, (iii) a significant inverse correlation existed between the diversity of CaMg and diversity of all other endobacteria. The latter suggests the existence of competition dynamics between different bacterial populations inside AMF spores and provides a basis for generation of testable hypotheses regarding the function of CaMg in AMF biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian innate immune system uses cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to synthesize the cyclic dinucleotide 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP during antiviral and antitumor immune responses. 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP is a nucleotide second messenger that initiates inflammatory signaling by binding to and activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) receptor. Bacteria also encode cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) that produce nucleotide second messengers to initiate antiviral (antiphage) signaling. Bacterial CD-NTases produce a wide range of cyclic oligonucleotides but have not been documented to produce 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP. Here we discovered bacterial CD-NTases that produce 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP to restrict phage replication. Bacterial 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP binds to CD-NTase associated protein 14 (Cap14), a transmembrane protein of unknown function. Using electrophysiology, we show that Cap14 is a chloride-selective ion channel that is activated by 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP binding. Cap14 adopts a modular architecture, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal nucleotide-binding SAVED domain. Domain-swapping experiments demonstrated the Cap14 transmembrane region could be substituted with a nuclease, thereby generating a biosensor that is selective for 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP. This study reveals that 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP signaling extends beyond metazoa to bacteria. Further, our findings suggest that transmembrane proteins of unknown function in bacterial immune pathways may broadly function as nucleotide-gated ion channels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Marine environments harbor a vast diversity of microorganisms, which have developed multiple strategies to adapt to stress conditions such as high salt concentrations and nutrient scarcity and, thus, are a source of natural products and high-value enzymes, as they have the ability to degrade complex polymeric substrates. These features make marine microorganisms a valuable source for the development of new biotechnological tools. Here, we focused on the isolation of filamentous fungi, using sediment samples collected from estuaries of the Basque Country in the Bay of Biscay. The phenotype of these isolates was characterized based on the potential to grow on complex marine polysaccharides or to secrete pigments to the culture medium. Based on this screening, the genomes of two isolates of the order Hypocreales, Marquandomyces marquandii and Albophoma yamanashiensis, were sequenced and are described here for the first time. The analysis of their CAZYme (carbohydrate-active enzyme) and secondary metabolite gene-cluster repertoires suggest that these estuarine isolates could be used as a source of novel enzymatic activities and secondary metabolites.

One-sentence summaryIsolation and characterization of filamentous fungi from sediments of Basque estuaries and an assessment of their biotechnological potential.

ImportanceMarine microbes are considered an unlimited source of molecules for biotechnology in fields such as pharmaceutics, biomedicine, cosmetics, nutraceutics, food, feed or agriculture. Thus, it is believed that blue biotechnology will make a significant contribution to the sustainability of global economy. However, the study of marine fungi lags behind that of marine bacteria and it is considered that the potential impact of fungi at the biotechnological level is underestimated. In this work, filamentous fungi from sediment samples of estuaries of the Basque Country have been isolated and the genomes of the Sordariomycete fungi Marquandomyces marquandii and Albophoma yamanashiensis sequenced and analyzed. Their characterization will contribute to the inventory of the genomic diversity within filamentous fungi and the identification of species and activities with biotechnological potential.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic lipopeptides are key bioactive secondary metabolites produced by some plant beneficial rhizobacteria such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus. They exhibit antimicrobial properties, promote induced systemic resistance in plants and support key developmental traits including motility, biofilm formation and root colonization. However, our knowledge about the fate of lipopeptides once released in the environment and especially upon contact with neighboring rhizobacteria remains limited. Here, we investigated the enzymatic degradation of Bacillus and Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides by Streptomyces venezuelae. We observed that Streptomyces is able to degrade the three lipopeptides surfactin, iturin and fengycin upon confrontation with of B. velezensis in vitro and in planta according to specific mechanisms. S. venezuelae was also able to degrade the structurally diverse sessilin, tolaasin, orfamide, xantholisin and putisolvin-type lipopeptides produced by Pseudomonas, indicating that this trait is likely engage in the interaction with various competitors.Furthermore, the degradation of CLPs is associated with the release of free amino and fatty acids and was found to enhance Streptomyces growth, indicating a possible nutritional utilization. Thereby, this work stresses on how the enzymatic arsenal of S. venezuelae may contribute to its adaptation to BSMs-driven interactions with microbial competitors. The ability of Streptomyces to degrade exogenous lipopeptides and feed on them adds a new facet to the implications of the degradation of those compounds by Streptomyces, where linearization of surfactin was previously reported as a detoxification mechanism. Additionally, we hypothesize that lipopeptide-producing rhizobacteria and their biocontrol potential are impacted by the degradation of their lipopeptides as observed with the polarized motility of B. velezensis, avoiding the confrontation zone with Streptomyces and the loss of antifungal properties of degraded iturin. This work illustrates how CLPs, once released in the environment, may rapidly be remodeled or degraded by members of the bacterial community, with potential impacts on CLP-producing rhizobacteria and the biocontrol products derived from them.</p>
