R.\nScore: 70.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571720\nAll respiratory viruses establish primary infections in the nasal epithelium, where efficient innate immune induction may prevent dissemination to the lower airway and thus minimize pathogenesis. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause a range of pathologies, but the host and viral determinants of disease during common cold versus lethal HCoV infections are poorly understood. We model the initial site of infection using primary nasal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and human rhinovirus-16 are common cold-associated viruses that exhibit unique features in this model: early induction of antiviral interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-mediated viral clearance, and preferential replication at nasal airway temperature (33{degrees}C) which confers muted host IFN responses. In contrast, lethal SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV encode antagonist proteins that prevent IFN-mediated clearance in nasal cultures. Our study identifies features shared among common cold-associated viruses, highlighting nasal innate immune responses as predictive of infection outcomes and nasally-directed IFNs as potential therapeutics.\nVirological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 variant\nAuthors: Kaku, Y.; Okumura, K.; Padilla-Blanco, M.; Kosugi, Y.; Uriu, K.; Hinay, A. A.; Chen, L.; Plianchaisuk, A.; Kobiyama, K.; Ishii, K. J.; The Genotype to Phenotype Japan (G2P-Japan) Consortium, ; Zahradnik, J.; Ito, J.; Sato, K.\nScore: 764.2, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570782\nThe SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 lineage, first identified in August 2023, is phylogenetically distinct from the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB lineages, including EG.5.1 and HK.3. Comparing to XBB and BA.2, BA.2.86 carries more than 30 mutations in the spike (S) protein, indicating a high potential for immune evasion. BA.2.86 has evolved and its descendant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), emerged in late 2023. JN.1 harbors S:L455S and three mutations in non-S proteins. S:L455S is a hallmark mutation of JN.1: we have recently shown that HK.3 and other \"FLip\" variants carry S:L455F, which contributes to increased transmissibility and immune escape ability compared to the parental EG.5.1 variant. Here, we investigated the virological properties of JN.1.\nTemperature impacts SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenicity and evolution\nAuthors: Dufloo, J.; Sanjuan, R.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572501\nSARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, which are characterized by different temperatures (33{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, respectively). In addition, fever is a common COVID-19 symptom. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to replicate more efficiently at low temperatures but the effect of temperature on different viral proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how temperature affects the SARS-CoV-2 spike function and evolution. We first observed that rising temperature from 33{degrees}C to 37{degrees}C or 39{degrees}C increased spike-mediated cell-cell fusion. We then experimentally evolved a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike at these different temperatures. We found that spike-mediated cell-cell fusion was maintained during evolution at 39{degrees}C, but was lost in a high proportion of viruses evolved at 33{degrees}C or 37{degrees}C. Consistently, sequencing of the spikes evolved at 33{degrees}C or 37{degrees}C revealed the accumulation of mutations around the furin cleavage site, a region that determines cell-cell fusion, whereas this did not occur in spikes evolved at 39{degrees}C. Finally, using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that disruption of the furin cleavage site had a temperature-dependent effect on spike-induced cell-cell fusion and viral fitness. Our results suggest that variations in body temperature may affect the activity and diversification of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. ImportanceWhen it infects humans, SARS-CoV-2 is exposed to different temperaures (e.g. replication site, fever...). Temperature has been shown to strongly impact SARS-CoV-2 replication but how it affects the activity and evolution of the spike protein remains poorly understood. Here, we first show that high temperatures increase the SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenicity. Then, we demonstrate that the evolution of the spike activity and variants depends on temperature. Finally, we show that the functional effect of specific spike mutations is temperature-dependent. Overall, our results suggest that temperature may be a factor influencing the activity and adapatation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in vivo, which will help understanding viral tropism, pathogenesis, and evolution.\nEngineered Skin Microbiome Reduces Mosquito Attraction to Mice\nAuthors: Liu, F.; Coutinho-Abreu, I. V.; Raban, R.; Nguyen, T.; Dimas, A.; Merriman, J.; Akbari, O.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572663\nThe skin microbiome plays a pivotal role in the production of attractive cues detected by mosquitoes. Here we leveraged recent advances in genetic engineering to significantly reduce the production of L-(+)-lactic acid as a strategy to reduce mosquito attraction to the highly prominent skin commensals Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium amycolatum. Engraftment of these engineered bacteria onto the skin of mice reduced mosquito attraction and feeding for up to 11 uninterrupted days, which is considerably longer than the several hours of protection conferred by the leading chemical repellent DEET. Taken together, our findings demonstrate engineering the skin microbiome to reduce attractive volatiles represents an innovative untapped strategy to reduce vector attraction, preventing bites, and pathogen transmission setting the stage for new classes of long-lasting microbiome-based repellent products. One-Sentence SummaryModified microbes make skin less attractive to mosquitoes\nMetabolism of ʟ -arabinose converges with virulence regulation to promote enteric pathogen fitness\nAuthors: Cottam, C.; White, R. T.; Beck, L. C.; Stewart, C. J.; Beatson, S. A.; Lowe, E. C.; Grinter, R.; Connolly, J. P.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572775\nVirulence and metabolism are often interlinked to control the expression of essential colonisation factors in response to host-associated signals. Here, we identified a novel transporter of the dietary monosaccharide -arabinose that is widely encoded by the zoonotic pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), required for full competitive fitness in the mouse gut and highly expressed during human infection. Accordingly, we discovered that -arabinose induces expression of the EHEC type 3 secretion system, enhancing its ability to attach to host cells, and that the underlying mechanism is dependent on products of its catabolism rather than the sensing of -arabinose as a signal. Finally, using the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we show that -arabinose metabolism provides a fitness benefit during enteric infection via virulence factor regulation, as opposed to supporting pathogen growth. This study describes an intrinsic mechanism of integrating central sugar metabolism with virulence regulation and highlights the unexpected impact that nutrient utilisation can have in enteric pathogens.\nVirus-encoded glycosyltransferases hypermodify DNA with diverse glycans\nAuthors: Pyle, J. D.; Lund, S. R.; O'Toole, K. H.; Saleh, L.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572611\nEnzymatic modification of DNA nucleobases can coordinate gene expression, protection from nucleases, or mutagenesis. We recently discovered a new clade of phage-specific cytosine methyltransferase (MT) and 5-methylpyrimidine dioxygenase (5mYOX, e.g., TET) enzymes that produce 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a precursor for additional post-replicative enzymatic hypermodifications on viral genomes. Here, we identify phage MT- and 5mYOX-dependent glycosyltransferase (GT) enzymes that catalyze linkage of diverse glycans directly onto 5hmC reactive nucleobase substrates. Using targeted bioinformatic mining of the phage metavirome databases, we discovered thousands of new biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) containing enzymes with predicted roles in cytosine sugar hypermodification. We developed a pathway reassembly platform for high-throughput functional screening of GT-containing BGCs, relying on the endogenous E. coli metabolome as a substrate pool. We successfully reconstituted a subset of phage BGCs and isolated novel and highly diverse sugar modifications appended to 5hmC, including mono-, di-, or tri-saccharide moieties comprised of hexose, N-acetylhexosamine or heptose sugars. Structural predictions and sugar product analyses suggest that phage GTs are related to host lipopolysaccharide, teichoic acid, and other small molecule biosynthesis enzymes and have been repurposed for DNA substrates. An expanded metagenomic search revealed hypermodification BGCs within gene neighborhoods containing phage structural proteins and putative genome defense systems. These findings enrich our knowledge of secondary modifications on DNA and the origins of corresponding sugar writer enzymes. Post-replicative cytosine hypermodification by virus-encoded GTs is discussed in the context of genome defense, DNA partitioning and virion assembly, and host-pathogen co-evolution.\nVirion morphology and on-virus spike protein structures of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants\nAuthors: Ke, Z.; Peacock, T. P.; Brown, J. C.; Sheppard, C. M.; Croll, T. I.; Kotecha, A.; Goldhill, D. H.; Barclay, W. S.; Briggs, J. A.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572824\nThe evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased fitness has been accompanied by structural changes in the spike (S) proteins that are the major target for the adaptive immune response. Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of soluble S from SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed this structural adaptation at high-resolution. The analysis of S trimers in situ on intact virions has the potential to provide more functionally relevant insights into S structure and virion morphology. Here, we characterized B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, and Mu variants by cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, assessing S cleavage, virion morphology, S incorporation, \"in-situ\" high-resolution S structures and the range of S conformational states. We found no evidence for adaptive changes in virion morphology, but describe multiple different positions in the S protein where amino acid changes alter local protein structure. Considered together, our data is consistent with a model where amino acid changes at multiple positions from the top to the base of the spike cause structural changes that can modulate the conformational dynamics of S.\nNovel nitrifying symbiont lineages are vertically inherited and widespread in marine sponges\nAuthors: Glasl, B.; Luter, H. M.; Damjanovic, K.; Kitzinger, K.; Mueller, A. J.; Mahler, L.; Engelberts, J. P.; Rix, L.; Osvatic, J. T.; Hausmann, B.; Seneca, J.; Daims, H.; Pjevac, P.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573102\nAmmonia-oxidising archaea and nitrite-oxidising bacteria are common members of marine sponge microbiomes. They derive energy for carbon fixation and growth from nitrification - the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and further to nitrate - and are proposed to play essential roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycling of sponge holobionts. In this study, we characterise two novel nitrifying symbiont lineages, Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion in the marine sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi using a combination of molecular tools, single-cell imaging techniques, and physiological rate measurements. Both represent a new genus in the ammonia-oxidising archaeal class Nitrososphaeria and the nitrite-oxidising bacterial order Nitrospirales, respectively. Furthermore, we show that larvae of this viviparous sponge are densely colonised by representatives of Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion indicating vertical transmission. In adults, the representatives of both symbiont genera are located extracellularly in the mesohyl. Comparative metagenome analyses and physiological data suggest that ammonia-oxidising archaeal symbionts of the genus Ca. Nitrosokoinonia strongly rely on endogenously produced nitrogenous compounds (i.e., ammonium, urea, nitriles/cyanides, and creatinine) rather than on exogenous ammonium sources taken up by the sponge. Additionally, the nitrite-oxidising bacterial symbionts Ca. Nitrosymbion may reciprocally support the ammonia-oxidisers with ammonia via the utilisation of sponge-derived urea and cyanate. Interestingly, comparative analyses of published environmental 16S rRNA amplicon data revealed that Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion are widely distributed and predominantly associated with marine sponges and corals, suggesting a broad relevance of our findings.\nExtensive variation and strain-specificity in dengue virus susceptibility among African Aedes aegypti populations\nAuthors: Dabo, S.; Henrion-Lacritick, A.; Lecuyer, A.; Jiolle, D.; Paupy, C.; Ayala, D.; da Veiga Leal, S.; Badolo, A.; Vega-Rua, A.; Sylla, M.; Akorli, J.; Otoo, S.; Lutomiah, J.; Sang, R.; Mutebi, J.-P.; Saleh, M.-C.; Rose, N.; McBride, C.; Lambrechts, L.\nScore: 32.0, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571617\nAfrican populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti are usually considered less susceptible to infection by human-pathogenic flaviviruses than globally invasive populations found outside Africa. Although this contrast has been well documented for Zika virus (ZIKV), it is unclear to what extent it is true for dengue virus (DENV), the most prevalent flavivirus of humans. Addressing this question is complicated by substantial genetic diversity among DENV strains, most notably in the form of four genetic types (DENV1 to DENV4), that can lead to genetically specific interactions with mosquito populations. Here, we carried out a continent-wide survey of DENV susceptibility using a panel of field-derived Ae. aegypti colonies from across the African range of the species and a colony from Guadeloupe, French West Indies as non-African reference. We found considerable variation in the ability of African Ae. aegypti populations to acquire and replicate a panel of six DENV strains spanning the four DENV types. Although African Ae. aegypti populations were generally less susceptible than the reference non-African population from Guadeloupe, in several instances some African populations were equally or more susceptible than the Guadeloupe population. Moreover, the relative level of susceptibility between African mosquito populations depended on the DENV strain, indicating genetically specific interactions. We conclude that unlike ZIKV susceptibility, there is no clear-cut dichotomy in DENV susceptibility between African and non-African Ae. aegypti. DENV susceptibility of African Ae. aegypti populations is highly heterogeneous and largely governed by the specific pairing of mosquito population and DENV strain. Author summaryAfrican populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti are usually thought to be less likely to get infected by flaviviruses compared to Ae. aegypti mosquitoes found outside Africa. While this has been well-demonstrated for Zika virus, it is not clear if the same is true for dengue virus, which is the most common flavivirus in humans. Studying this is complicated by the strain diversity of dengue virus, including four main genetic types, potentially causing different interactions. In this study, we compared several mosquito populations and found that, in general, African mosquitoes were less likely to get infected by dengue virus compared to mosquitoes from outside Africa. However, in some cases, African mosquitoes were just as or even more likely to get infected. The specific strain of dengue virus also influenced how likely African mosquitoes were to get infected, showing that the relationship between African mosquitoes and dengue virus is complex.\nGut protective Klebsiella species promotes microbiota recovery and pathobiont clearance while preventing inflammation\nAuthors: Cabral, V.; Oliveira, R. A.; Correia, M. B.; Pedro, M. F.; Ubeda, C.; Xavier, K. B.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.566997\nThe microbiota inhabiting the mammalian gut serves as a protective barrier against pathogen invasion through a mechanism known as colonization resistance. Antibiotic treatments can inadvertently disturb the gut microbiota, compromising colonization resistance and increasing hosts susceptible to infections. Non-pneumoniae Klebsiella spp. members of the gut microbiota play a crucial role in colonization resistance and clearance from the gut of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae following antibiotic-induced perturbations. Specifically, Klebsiella strain ARO112 a gut microbiota isolate, can effectively resist and clear Escherichia coli colonization after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. We assessed the potential of Klebsiella sp ARO112 to promote clearance of Enterobacteriaceae pathobiont Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) mouse model susceptible to inflammatory episodes. In antibiotic-treated IBD-predisposed mice infected with the AIEC, Klebsiella sp. ARO112 promoted a faster recovery of gut microbiota members potentially involved in butyrate production and accelerated pathobiont clearance. Functionally, ARO112-driven microbiota recovery promoted higher butyrate levels and prevented intestinal inflammation compared to untreated animals. Conversely, treatment with the well-known probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 enhanced AIEC colonization and inflammation. Furthermore, we assessed the safety of ARO112 as a potential next-generation probiotic; phenotypic comparison of ARO112 against closely related Enterobacteriaceae revealed its lower pathogenic potential, including being more recalcitrant to antibiotic resistance acquisition. Overall, our results showing that Klebsiella sp. ARO112 can resolve infections while contributing to the promotion of intestinal health, underscore its potential as a biotherapy agent that can disrupt inflammation-treatment-infection cycles. This potential extends beyond IBD patients, encompassing individuals with other inflammatory-based conditions related to microbiota imbalances.\n",

        <p class="abstract">All respiratory viruses establish primary infections in the nasal epithelium, where efficient innate immune induction may prevent dissemination to the lower airway and thus minimize pathogenesis. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause a range of pathologies, but the host and viral determinants of disease during common cold versus lethal HCoV infections are poorly understood. We model the initial site of infection using primary nasal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and human rhinovirus-16 are common cold-associated viruses that exhibit unique features in this model: early induction of antiviral interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-mediated viral clearance, and preferential replication at nasal airway temperature (33{degrees}C) which confers muted host IFN responses. In contrast, lethal SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV encode antagonist proteins that prevent IFN-mediated clearance in nasal cultures. Our study identifies features shared among common cold-associated viruses, highlighting nasal innate immune responses as predictive of infection outcomes and nasally-directed IFNs as potential therapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 lineage, first identified in August 2023, is phylogenetically distinct from the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB lineages, including EG.5.1 and HK.3. Comparing to XBB and BA.2, BA.2.86 carries more than 30 mutations in the spike (S) protein, indicating a high potential for immune evasion. BA.2.86 has evolved and its descendant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), emerged in late 2023. JN.1 harbors S:L455S and three mutations in non-S proteins. S:L455S is a hallmark mutation of JN.1: we have recently shown that HK.3 and other &#34;FLip&#34; variants carry S:L455F, which contributes to increased transmissibility and immune escape ability compared to the parental EG.5.1 variant. Here, we investigated the virological properties of JN.1.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, which are characterized by different temperatures (33{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, respectively). In addition, fever is a common COVID-19 symptom. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to replicate more efficiently at low temperatures but the effect of temperature on different viral proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how temperature affects the SARS-CoV-2 spike function and evolution. We first observed that rising temperature from 33{degrees}C to 37{degrees}C or 39{degrees}C increased spike-mediated cell-cell fusion. We then experimentally evolved a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike at these different temperatures. We found that spike-mediated cell-cell fusion was maintained during evolution at 39{degrees}C, but was lost in a high proportion of viruses evolved at 33{degrees}C or 37{degrees}C. Consistently, sequencing of the spikes evolved at 33{degrees}C or 37{degrees}C revealed the accumulation of mutations around the furin cleavage site, a region that determines cell-cell fusion, whereas this did not occur in spikes evolved at 39{degrees}C. Finally, using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that disruption of the furin cleavage site had a temperature-dependent effect on spike-induced cell-cell fusion and viral fitness. Our results suggest that variations in body temperature may affect the activity and diversification of the SARS-CoV-2 spike.

ImportanceWhen it infects humans, SARS-CoV-2 is exposed to different temperaures (e.g. replication site, fever...). Temperature has been shown to strongly impact SARS-CoV-2 replication but how it affects the activity and evolution of the spike protein remains poorly understood. Here, we first show that high temperatures increase the SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenicity. Then, we demonstrate that the evolution of the spike activity and variants depends on temperature. Finally, we show that the functional effect of specific spike mutations is temperature-dependent. Overall, our results suggest that temperature may be a factor influencing the activity and adapatation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in vivo, which will help understanding viral tropism, pathogenesis, and evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The skin microbiome plays a pivotal role in the production of attractive cues detected by mosquitoes. Here we leveraged recent advances in genetic engineering to significantly reduce the production of L-(&#43;)-lactic acid as a strategy to reduce mosquito attraction to the highly prominent skin commensals Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium amycolatum. Engraftment of these engineered bacteria onto the skin of mice reduced mosquito attraction and feeding for up to 11 uninterrupted days, which is considerably longer than the several hours of protection conferred by the leading chemical repellent DEET. Taken together, our findings demonstrate engineering the skin microbiome to reduce attractive volatiles represents an innovative untapped strategy to reduce vector attraction, preventing bites, and pathogen transmission setting the stage for new classes of long-lasting microbiome-based repellent products.

        <p class="abstract">Virulence and metabolism are often interlinked to control the expression of essential colonisation factors in response to host-associated signals. Here, we identified a novel transporter of the dietary monosaccharide -arabinose that is widely encoded by the zoonotic pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), required for full competitive fitness in the mouse gut and highly expressed during human infection. Accordingly, we discovered that -arabinose induces expression of the EHEC type 3 secretion system, enhancing its ability to attach to host cells, and that the underlying mechanism is dependent on products of its catabolism rather than the sensing of -arabinose as a signal. Finally, using the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we show that -arabinose metabolism provides a fitness benefit during enteric infection via virulence factor regulation, as opposed to supporting pathogen growth. This study describes an intrinsic mechanism of integrating central sugar metabolism with virulence regulation and highlights the unexpected impact that nutrient utilisation can have in enteric pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Enzymatic modification of DNA nucleobases can coordinate gene expression, protection from nucleases, or mutagenesis. We recently discovered a new clade of phage-specific cytosine methyltransferase (MT) and 5-methylpyrimidine dioxygenase (5mYOX, e.g., TET) enzymes that produce 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a precursor for additional post-replicative enzymatic hypermodifications on viral genomes. Here, we identify phage MT- and 5mYOX-dependent glycosyltransferase (GT) enzymes that catalyze linkage of diverse glycans directly onto 5hmC reactive nucleobase substrates. Using targeted bioinformatic mining of the phage metavirome databases, we discovered thousands of new biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) containing enzymes with predicted roles in cytosine sugar hypermodification. We developed a pathway reassembly platform for high-throughput functional screening of GT-containing BGCs, relying on the endogenous E. coli metabolome as a substrate pool. We successfully reconstituted a subset of phage BGCs and isolated novel and highly diverse sugar modifications appended to 5hmC, including mono-, di-, or tri-saccharide moieties comprised of hexose, N-acetylhexosamine or heptose sugars. Structural predictions and sugar product analyses suggest that phage GTs are related to host lipopolysaccharide, teichoic acid, and other small molecule biosynthesis enzymes and have been repurposed for DNA substrates. An expanded metagenomic search revealed hypermodification BGCs within gene neighborhoods containing phage structural proteins and putative genome defense systems. These findings enrich our knowledge of secondary modifications on DNA and the origins of corresponding sugar writer enzymes. Post-replicative cytosine hypermodification by virus-encoded GTs is discussed in the context of genome defense, DNA partitioning and virion assembly, and host-pathogen co-evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased fitness has been accompanied by structural changes in the spike (S) proteins that are the major target for the adaptive immune response. Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of soluble S from SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed this structural adaptation at high-resolution. The analysis of S trimers in situ on intact virions has the potential to provide more functionally relevant insights into S structure and virion morphology. Here, we characterized B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, and Mu variants by cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, assessing S cleavage, virion morphology, S incorporation, &#34;in-situ&#34; high-resolution S structures and the range of S conformational states. We found no evidence for adaptive changes in virion morphology, but describe multiple different positions in the S protein where amino acid changes alter local protein structure. Considered together, our data is consistent with a model where amino acid changes at multiple positions from the top to the base of the spike cause structural changes that can modulate the conformational dynamics of S.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ammonia-oxidising archaea and nitrite-oxidising bacteria are common members of marine sponge microbiomes. They derive energy for carbon fixation and growth from nitrification - the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and further to nitrate - and are proposed to play essential roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycling of sponge holobionts. In this study, we characterise two novel nitrifying symbiont lineages, Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion in the marine sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi using a combination of molecular tools, single-cell imaging techniques, and physiological rate measurements. Both represent a new genus in the ammonia-oxidising archaeal class Nitrososphaeria and the nitrite-oxidising bacterial order Nitrospirales, respectively. Furthermore, we show that larvae of this viviparous sponge are densely colonised by representatives of Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion indicating vertical transmission. In adults, the representatives of both symbiont genera are located extracellularly in the mesohyl. Comparative metagenome analyses and physiological data suggest that ammonia-oxidising archaeal symbionts of the genus Ca. Nitrosokoinonia strongly rely on endogenously produced nitrogenous compounds (i.e., ammonium, urea, nitriles/cyanides, and creatinine) rather than on exogenous ammonium sources taken up by the sponge. Additionally, the nitrite-oxidising bacterial symbionts Ca. Nitrosymbion may reciprocally support the ammonia-oxidisers with ammonia via the utilisation of sponge-derived urea and cyanate. Interestingly, comparative analyses of published environmental 16S rRNA amplicon data revealed that Ca. Nitrosokoinonia and Ca. Nitrosymbion are widely distributed and predominantly associated with marine sponges and corals, suggesting a broad relevance of our findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">African populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti are usually considered less susceptible to infection by human-pathogenic flaviviruses than globally invasive populations found outside Africa. Although this contrast has been well documented for Zika virus (ZIKV), it is unclear to what extent it is true for dengue virus (DENV), the most prevalent flavivirus of humans. Addressing this question is complicated by substantial genetic diversity among DENV strains, most notably in the form of four genetic types (DENV1 to DENV4), that can lead to genetically specific interactions with mosquito populations. Here, we carried out a continent-wide survey of DENV susceptibility using a panel of field-derived Ae. aegypti colonies from across the African range of the species and a colony from Guadeloupe, French West Indies as non-African reference. We found considerable variation in the ability of African Ae. aegypti populations to acquire and replicate a panel of six DENV strains spanning the four DENV types. Although African Ae. aegypti populations were generally less susceptible than the reference non-African population from Guadeloupe, in several instances some African populations were equally or more susceptible than the Guadeloupe population. Moreover, the relative level of susceptibility between African mosquito populations depended on the DENV strain, indicating genetically specific interactions. We conclude that unlike ZIKV susceptibility, there is no clear-cut dichotomy in DENV susceptibility between African and non-African Ae. aegypti. DENV susceptibility of African Ae. aegypti populations is highly heterogeneous and largely governed by the specific pairing of mosquito population and DENV strain.

Author summaryAfrican populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti are usually thought to be less likely to get infected by flaviviruses compared to Ae. aegypti mosquitoes found outside Africa. While this has been well-demonstrated for Zika virus, it is not clear if the same is true for dengue virus, which is the most common flavivirus in humans. Studying this is complicated by the strain diversity of dengue virus, including four main genetic types, potentially causing different interactions. In this study, we compared several mosquito populations and found that, in general, African mosquitoes were less likely to get infected by dengue virus compared to mosquitoes from outside Africa. However, in some cases, African mosquitoes were just as or even more likely to get infected. The specific strain of dengue virus also influenced how likely African mosquitoes were to get infected, showing that the relationship between African mosquitoes and dengue virus is complex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microbiota inhabiting the mammalian gut serves as a protective barrier against pathogen invasion through a mechanism known as colonization resistance. Antibiotic treatments can inadvertently disturb the gut microbiota, compromising colonization resistance and increasing hosts susceptible to infections. Non-pneumoniae Klebsiella spp. members of the gut microbiota play a crucial role in colonization resistance and clearance from the gut of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae following antibiotic-induced perturbations. Specifically, Klebsiella strain ARO112 a gut microbiota isolate, can effectively resist and clear Escherichia coli colonization after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.

We assessed the potential of Klebsiella sp ARO112 to promote clearance of Enterobacteriaceae pathobiont Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) mouse model susceptible to inflammatory episodes. In antibiotic-treated IBD-predisposed mice infected with the AIEC, Klebsiella sp. ARO112 promoted a faster recovery of gut microbiota members potentially involved in butyrate production and accelerated pathobiont clearance. Functionally, ARO112-driven microbiota recovery promoted higher butyrate levels and prevented intestinal inflammation compared to untreated animals. Conversely, treatment with the well-known probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 enhanced AIEC colonization and inflammation. Furthermore, we assessed the safety of ARO112 as a potential next-generation probiotic; phenotypic comparison of ARO112 against closely related Enterobacteriaceae revealed its lower pathogenic potential, including being more recalcitrant to antibiotic resistance acquisition.

Overall, our results showing that Klebsiella sp. ARO112 can resolve infections while contributing to the promotion of intestinal health, underscore its potential as a biotherapy agent that can disrupt inflammation-treatment-infection cycles. This potential extends beyond IBD patients, encompassing individuals with other inflammatory-based conditions related to microbiota imbalances.</p>
