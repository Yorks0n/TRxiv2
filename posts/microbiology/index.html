M.\nScore: 44.3, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546561\nMicrobiology and synthetic biology depend on reverse genetic approaches to manipulate bacterial genomes; however, existing methods require molecular biology to generate genomic homology, suffer from low efficiency, and are not easily scaled to high throughput applications. To overcome these limitations, we developed a system for creating kilobase-scale genomic modifications that uses DNA oligonucleotides to direct the integration of a non-replicating plasmid. This method, Oligonucleotide Recombineering followed by Bxb-1 Integrase Targeting (ORBIT) was pioneered in Mycobacteria, and here we adapt and expand it for E. coli. Our redesigned plasmid toolkit achieved nearly 1000x higher efficiency than {lambda} Red recombination and enabled precise, stable knockouts (\u003c134 kb) and integrations (\u003c11 kb) of various sizes. Additionally, we constructed multi-mutants (double and triple) in a single transformation, using orthogonal attachment sites. At high throughput, we used pools of targeting oligonucleotides to knock out nearly all known transcription factor and small RNA genes, yielding accurate, genome-wide, single mutant libraries. By counting genomic barcodes, we also show ORBIT libraries can scale to thousands of unique members (\u003e30k). This work demonstrates that ORBIT for E. coli is a flexible reverse genetic system that facilitates rapid construction of complex strains and readily scales to create sophisticated mutant libraries.\nA side-by-side comparison of peptide-delivered antisense antibiotics employing different nucleotide mimics\nAuthors: Ghosh, C.; Popella, L.; Dhamodharan, V.; Jung, J.; Barquist, L.; Hoebartner, C.; Vogel, J.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548539\nAntisense oligomer (ASO)-based antibiotics that target mRNAs of essential bacterial genes have great potential for counteracting antimicrobial resistance and for precision microbiome editing. To date, the development of such antisense antibiotics has primarily focused on using phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbones, largely ignoring the growing number of chemical modalities that have spurred the success of ASO-based human therapy. Here, we directly compare the activities of seven chemically distinct 10mer ASOs, all designed to target the essential gene acpP upon delivery with a KFF-peptide carrier into Salmonella. Our systematic analysis of PNA, PMO, phosphorothioate-modified DNA (PTO), 2-methylated RNA (RNA-OMe), 2-methoxyethylated RNA (RNA-MOE), 2-fluorinated RNA (RNA-F) and 2-4-locked RNA (LNA) is based on a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods to evaluate ASO uptake, target pairing and inhibition of bacterial growth. Our data show that only PNA and PMO are efficiently delivered by the KFF peptide into Salmonella to inhibit bacterial growth. Nevertheless, the strong target binding affinity and in vitro translational repression activity of LNA and RNA-MOE make them promising modalities for antisense antibiotics that will require the identification of an effective carrier.\nHigh-resolution profiling of bacterial and fungal communities using pangenome-informed taxon-specific amplicons and long-read sequencing\nAuthors: Stalder, L.; Maurhofer, M.; Croll, D.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549274\nHigh-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly advanced our understanding of microbiomes, but resolving microbial communities at species and strain levels remains challenging. In this study, we present a pipeline for designing, multiplexing, and sequencing highly polymorphic taxon-specific amplicons using PacBio circular consensus sequencing. We focus on the wheat microbiome as a proof-of-principle and demonstrate unprecedented resolution for the wheat-associated Pseudomonas microbiome and the ubiquitous fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our approach achieves an order of magnitude higher phylogenetic resolution compared to existing ribosomal amplicons. We show that the designed amplicons accurately capture species and strain diversity outperforming full-length 16S and ITS amplicons. We track microbial communities in the wheat phyllosphere across time and space to establish fine-grained species and strain-specific dynamics. The high-resolution profiling provided by taxon-specific amplicons opens new avenues for studying microbial community dynamics in complex environments. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness and scalability of our approach make it applicable to diverse ecological studies. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of long-read amplicon sequencing to overcome limitations in phylogenetic resolution and enhance our understanding of microbiome diversity and dynamics.\nPolysaccharide breakdown products drive degradation-dispersal cycles of foraging bacteria through changes in metabolism and motility\nAuthors: Stubbusch, A. K. M.; Keegstra, J. M.; Schwartzman, J.; Pontrelli, S.; Clerc, E. E.; Stocker, R.; Magnabosco, C.; Schubert, O. T.; Ackermann, M.; D'Souza, G. G.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548877\nMost of Earths biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO2. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though these degradation-dispersal cycles are an integral part in the global carbon cycle, we know little about how cells alternate between degradation and motility, and which signal triggers this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium Vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate. We used microfluidics-coupled time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. Single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward alginate hotspots, likely enabling cells to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles that drive remineralization in natural environments. ImportancePolysaccharides, also known as glycans, are the most abundant form of biomass on Earth and understanding how they are degraded by microorganisms is essential for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the storage and release of CO2 by natural systems. Although group formation is a common strategy used by bacterial cells to degrade ubiquitous polymeric growth substrates in nature, where nutrient hotspots are heterogeneously distributed, little is known about how cells prepare for dispersal from an exhausted nutrient source and re-initiate degradation of new nutrient patches. By quantifying growth, motility and chemotaxis of individual cells and comparing gene expression changes when populations were exposed to either polysaccharides or their degradation products in the form of digested polysaccharides, we show that bacterial cells alter their behavior when they experience a shift from polymeric to digested polysaccharides: After cells form groups during growth on polymers, the exposure to degradation products made cells motile, enabling dispersal from sessile cell groups and - guided by chemotaxis - movement towards new polysaccharide hotspots. Our study sheds light on the cellular processes that drive bacterial growth and behavior during carbon remineralization, an important driver of CO2 release from biomass in natural systems.\nBridges instead of boats? The Mla system of diderm Firmicute Veillonella parvula reveals an ancestral transenvelope core of phospholipid trafficking\nAuthors: BELOIN, C.; Grasekamp, K. P.; Beaud, B.; Taib, N.; Audrain, B.; Bardiaux, B.; Rossez, Y.; IZADI-PRUNEYRE, N.; Lejeune, M.; Trivelli, X.; Chouit, Z.; Guerardel, Y.; GHIGO, J.-M.; Gribaldo, S.\nScore: 35.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547184\nDespite extensive characterisation of envelope biogenesis systems in diderm bacteria, glycerophospholipid (GPL) trafficking remains poorly understood, and has only been studied in a handful of model species. Within the Proteobacteria, the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system facilitates retrograde GPL trafficking via six proteins, MlaA-F. GPLs are extracted from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane by the lipoprotein MlaA which associates with porin trimers, then shipped through the periplasmic space by the chaperone MlaC, which finally delivers GPLs to the inner membrane complex formed by MlaBDEF. Here, we investigate GPL trafficking in Veillonella parvula, a diderm member of the Firmicutes which encodes an Mla system devoid of MlaA and MlaC. V. parvula {Delta}mla mutants display phenotypes characteristic of disrupted lipid asymmetry such as hypervesiculation and detergent hypersensitivity, and lipid content analysis from outer membrane vesicles reveals an enrichment for the major lipid component phosphatidylethanolamine. Interestingly, suppressor analysis identifies mutations in tamB that rescue detergent hypersensitivity and hypervesiculation of {Delta}mla strains, supporting the involvement of these two systems in antagonistic GPL trafficking functions across diverse bacterial lineages. A combination of structural modeling and subcellular localisation assays shows that MlaDVp is longer than in classical diderm models and forms a transenvelope bridge, encoding both an inner membrane-localised MCE domain and an outer membrane {beta}-barrel. These results strongly suggest that V. parvula possesses a minimal Mla system for GPL trafficking, replacing the need for chaperones and outer membrane lipoproteins by directly connecting the two membranes. Finally, phylogenomic analysis indicates that this MlaEFD self-contained architecture is widely distributed in diderm bacteria and most likely represents the ancestral functional core of the Mla system, which subsequently increased in complexity in Proteobacteria and closely related phyla following the emergence of MlaABC. Our work broadens the diversity of current models of GPL trafficking in diderm bacteria, challenging the paradigm set by classical models and shedding light on the evolution of a crucial system in the biogenesis and maintenance of the bacterial outer membrane.\nLC3B conjugation machinery promotes autophagy-independent HIV-1 entry in CD4+ T lymphocytes\nAuthors: Pradel, B.; Deffieu, M. S.; Robert-Hebmann, V.; Cantaloube, G.; Faure, M.; Chazal, N.; Gaudin, R.; Espert, L.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548555\nHIV-1 entry into CD4+ T lymphocytes relies on the viral and cellular membranes fusion, leading to viral capsid delivery in the cytoplasm of target cells. The conjugation of ATG8/LC3B protein, process referred to as ATG8ylation and mainly studied in the context of autophagy, occurs transiently in the early stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle in CD4+ T lymphocytes. Despite numerous studies investigating the interplays of HIV-1 with autophagy machinery, the impact of ATG8ylation in the early stages of HIV-1 infection remains unknown. Here we found that HIV-1 exposure leads to the rapid enrichment of LC3B towards the target cell plasma membrane, in close proximity with the incoming viral particles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATG8ylation is a key event that facilitates HIV-1 fusion with target CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, this effect is independent of the canonical autophagy pathway as ATG13 silencing does not prevent HIV-1 entry. Together, our results provide an unconventional role of LC3B conjugation subverted by HIV-1 to achieve a critical early step of its replication cycle. TeaserHIV-1 induces LC3B enrichment towards its target cell entry site and uses the conjugation of this protein to favor its entry step.\nOral immunization with rVSV bivalent vaccine elicits protective immune responses, including ADCC, against both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A viruses\nAuthors: Ouyang, M. J.; Ao, Z.; Olukitibi, T.; Lawrynuik, P.; Shieh, C.; Kung, S.; Fowke, K.; Kobasa, D.; Yao, X.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549076\nCOVID-19 and influenza both cause enormous disease burdens, and vaccines are the primary measures for their control. Since these viral diseases are transmitted through the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, developing an effective and convenient mucosal vaccine should be a high priority. We previously reported a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based bivalent vaccine (v-EM2/SP{Delta}C1Delta) that protects animals from both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses via intramuscular and intranasal immunization. Here, we further investigated the immune response induced by oral immunization with this vaccine and its protective efficacy in mice. The results demonstrated that the oral cavity delivery, like the intranasal route, elicited strong and protective systemic immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. This included high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, as well as strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and anti-influenza M2 ADCC responses in mice sera. Furthermore, it provided efficient protection against challenge with influenza H1N1 virus in a mouse model, with a 100% survival rate and a significant low lung viral load of influenza virus. All these findings provide substantial evidence for the effectiveness of oral immunization with the rVSV bivalent vaccine.\nDual Membrane-Sspanning Anti-Sigma Factors Regulate Vesiculation in Gut Bacteroidota\nAuthors: Pardue, E. J.; Sartorio, M.; Jana, B.; Scott, N.; Beatty, W.; Ortiz-Marquez, J.; van Opijnen, T.; Hsu, F.-F.; Potter, R. F.; Feldman, M.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548920\nBacteroidota are abundant members of the human gut microbiota that shape the enteric landscape by modulating host immunity and degrading dietary- and host-derived glycans. These processes are at least partially mediated by Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). In this work, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify genes required for OMV biogenesis and its regulation in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). Our screening led us to the identification of a novel family of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factors (Dma), which regulate OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employed molecular and multiomic analyses to demonstrate that deletion of Dma1, the founding member of the Dma family, results in hypervesiculation by modulating the expression of NigD1, which belongs to a family of uncharacterized proteins found throughout Bacteroidota. Dma1 has an unprecedented domain organization: it contains a C-terminal {beta}-barrel embedded in the OM; its N-terminal domain interacts with its cognate sigma factor in the cytoplasm, and both domains are tethered via an intrinsically disordered region that traverses the periplasm. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the Dma family is a unique feature of Bacteroidota. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into the regulation of OMV biogenesis in human gut bacteria.\nThe distribution of fitness effects of plasmid pOXA-48 in clinical enterobacteria\nAuthors: Fernandez-Calvet, A.; Toribio-Celestino, L.; Alonso-del Valle, A.; Sastre-Dominguez, J.; Valdes-Chiara, P.; San Millan, A.; DelaFuente, J.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548518\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a major public health problem. The main route for AMR acquisition in clinically important bacteria is the horizontal transfer of plasmids carrying resistance genes. AMR plasmids allow bacteria to survive antibiotics, but they also entail physiological alterations in the host cell. Multiple studies over the last years indicate that these alterations can translate into a fitness cost when antibiotics are absent. However, due to technical limitations, most of these studies are based on analysing new associations between plasmids and bacteria generated in vitro, and we know very little about the effects of plasmids in their native bacterial hosts. In this study, we used a CRISPR-Cas9-tool to selectively cure plasmids from clinical enterobacteria to overcome this limitation. Using this approach, we were able to study the fitness effects of the carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in 35 pOXA-48-carrying isolates recovered from hospitalised patients. Our results revealed that pOXA-48 produces variable effects across the collection of wild type enterobacterial strains naturally carrying the plasmid, ranging from fitness costs to fitness benefits. Importantly, the plasmid was only associated with a significant fitness reduction in 4 out of 35 clones, and produced no significant changes in fitness in the great majority of isolates. Our results suggest that plasmids produce neutral fitness effects in most native bacterial hosts, helping to explain the great prevalence of plasmids in natural microbial communities.\nGlycan-specific IgM is critical for human immunity to Staphylococcus aureus\nAuthors: Hendriks, A.; Kerkman, P. F.; Varkila, M. R.; Haitsma-Mulier, J. L.; Ali, S.; ten Doesschate, T.; van der Vaart, T. W.; de Haas, C. J. C.; Aerts, P. C.; Cremer, O. L.; Bonten, M. J.; Nizet, V.; Liu, G. Y.; Codee, J. D. C.; Rooijakkers, S. H.; van Strijp, J. A.; van Sorge, N. M.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548956\nStaphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen but the immune factors that protect against it remain elusive. In particular, high opsonic IgG titers achieved in preclinical S. aureus animal immunization studies have consistently failed to translate to protection in human clinical trials. Here, we investigated the antibody responses to a conserved surface glycan, Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA). IgM and IgG antibodies specific to WTA were universally present in plasma from healthy individuals. Functionally, WTA-specific IgM outperformed IgG in opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus and conferred passive protection against S. aureus infection in vivo. In the clinical setting, WTA-specific IgM responses, but not IgG responses, were significantly lower in S. aureus bacteremia patients compared to healthy individuals, correlated with mortality risk and showed impaired bacterial opsonization. Our findings can guide risk stratification of hospitalized patients and inform future design of antibody-based therapies and vaccines against serious S. aureus infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Microbiology and synthetic biology depend on reverse genetic approaches to manipulate bacterial genomes; however, existing methods require molecular biology to generate genomic homology, suffer from low efficiency, and are not easily scaled to high throughput applications. To overcome these limitations, we developed a system for creating kilobase-scale genomic modifications that uses DNA oligonucleotides to direct the integration of a non-replicating plasmid. This method, Oligonucleotide Recombineering followed by Bxb-1 Integrase Targeting (ORBIT) was pioneered in Mycobacteria, and here we adapt and expand it for E. coli. Our redesigned plasmid toolkit achieved nearly 1000x higher efficiency than {lambda} Red recombination and enabled precise, stable knockouts (&lt;134 kb) and integrations (&lt;11 kb) of various sizes. Additionally, we constructed multi-mutants (double and triple) in a single transformation, using orthogonal attachment sites. At high throughput, we used pools of targeting oligonucleotides to knock out nearly all known transcription factor and small RNA genes, yielding accurate, genome-wide, single mutant libraries. By counting genomic barcodes, we also show ORBIT libraries can scale to thousands of unique members (&gt;30k). This work demonstrates that ORBIT for E. coli is a flexible reverse genetic system that facilitates rapid construction of complex strains and readily scales to create sophisticated mutant libraries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antisense oligomer (ASO)-based antibiotics that target mRNAs of essential bacterial genes have great potential for counteracting antimicrobial resistance and for precision microbiome editing. To date, the development of such antisense antibiotics has primarily focused on using phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbones, largely ignoring the growing number of chemical modalities that have spurred the success of ASO-based human therapy. Here, we directly compare the activities of seven chemically distinct 10mer ASOs, all designed to target the essential gene acpP upon delivery with a KFF-peptide carrier into Salmonella. Our systematic analysis of PNA, PMO, phosphorothioate-modified DNA (PTO), 2-methylated RNA (RNA-OMe), 2-methoxyethylated RNA (RNA-MOE), 2-fluorinated RNA (RNA-F) and 2-4-locked RNA (LNA) is based on a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods to evaluate ASO uptake, target pairing and inhibition of bacterial growth. Our data show that only PNA and PMO are efficiently delivered by the KFF peptide into Salmonella to inhibit bacterial growth. Nevertheless, the strong target binding affinity and in vitro translational repression activity of LNA and RNA-MOE make them promising modalities for antisense antibiotics that will require the identification of an effective carrier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">High-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly advanced our understanding of microbiomes, but resolving microbial communities at species and strain levels remains challenging. In this study, we present a pipeline for designing, multiplexing, and sequencing highly polymorphic taxon-specific amplicons using PacBio circular consensus sequencing. We focus on the wheat microbiome as a proof-of-principle and demonstrate unprecedented resolution for the wheat-associated Pseudomonas microbiome and the ubiquitous fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our approach achieves an order of magnitude higher phylogenetic resolution compared to existing ribosomal amplicons. We show that the designed amplicons accurately capture species and strain diversity outperforming full-length 16S and ITS amplicons. We track microbial communities in the wheat phyllosphere across time and space to establish fine-grained species and strain-specific dynamics. The high-resolution profiling provided by taxon-specific amplicons opens new avenues for studying microbial community dynamics in complex environments. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness and scalability of our approach make it applicable to diverse ecological studies. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of long-read amplicon sequencing to overcome limitations in phylogenetic resolution and enhance our understanding of microbiome diversity and dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most of Earths biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO2. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though these degradation-dispersal cycles are an integral part in the global carbon cycle, we know little about how cells alternate between degradation and motility, and which signal triggers this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium Vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate. We used microfluidics-coupled time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. Single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward alginate hotspots, likely enabling cells to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles that drive remineralization in natural environments.

ImportancePolysaccharides, also known as glycans, are the most abundant form of biomass on Earth and understanding how they are degraded by microorganisms is essential for our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the storage and release of CO2 by natural systems. Although group formation is a common strategy used by bacterial cells to degrade ubiquitous polymeric growth substrates in nature, where nutrient hotspots are heterogeneously distributed, little is known about how cells prepare for dispersal from an exhausted nutrient source and re-initiate degradation of new nutrient patches. By quantifying growth, motility and chemotaxis of individual cells and comparing gene expression changes when populations were exposed to either polysaccharides or their degradation products in the form of digested polysaccharides, we show that bacterial cells alter their behavior when they experience a shift from polymeric to digested polysaccharides: After cells form groups during growth on polymers, the exposure to degradation products made cells motile, enabling dispersal from sessile cell groups and - guided by chemotaxis - movement towards new polysaccharide hotspots. Our study sheds light on the cellular processes that drive bacterial growth and behavior during carbon remineralization, an important driver of CO2 release from biomass in natural systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite extensive characterisation of envelope biogenesis systems in diderm bacteria, glycerophospholipid (GPL) trafficking remains poorly understood, and has only been studied in a handful of model species. Within the Proteobacteria, the maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) system facilitates retrograde GPL trafficking via six proteins, MlaA-F. GPLs are extracted from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane by the lipoprotein MlaA which associates with porin trimers, then shipped through the periplasmic space by the chaperone MlaC, which finally delivers GPLs to the inner membrane complex formed by MlaBDEF. Here, we investigate GPL trafficking in Veillonella parvula, a diderm member of the Firmicutes which encodes an Mla system devoid of MlaA and MlaC. V. parvula {Delta}mla mutants display phenotypes characteristic of disrupted lipid asymmetry such as hypervesiculation and detergent hypersensitivity, and lipid content analysis from outer membrane vesicles reveals an enrichment for the major lipid component phosphatidylethanolamine. Interestingly, suppressor analysis identifies mutations in tamB that rescue detergent hypersensitivity and hypervesiculation of {Delta}mla strains, supporting the involvement of these two systems in antagonistic GPL trafficking functions across diverse bacterial lineages. A combination of structural modeling and subcellular localisation assays shows that MlaDVp is longer than in classical diderm models and forms a transenvelope bridge, encoding both an inner membrane-localised MCE domain and an outer membrane {beta}-barrel. These results strongly suggest that V. parvula possesses a minimal Mla system for GPL trafficking, replacing the need for chaperones and outer membrane lipoproteins by directly connecting the two membranes. Finally, phylogenomic analysis indicates that this MlaEFD self-contained architecture is widely distributed in diderm bacteria and most likely represents the ancestral functional core of the Mla system, which subsequently increased in complexity in Proteobacteria and closely related phyla following the emergence of MlaABC. Our work broadens the diversity of current models of GPL trafficking in diderm bacteria, challenging the paradigm set by classical models and shedding light on the evolution of a crucial system in the biogenesis and maintenance of the bacterial outer membrane.</p>

        <p class="abstract">HIV-1 entry into CD4&#43; T lymphocytes relies on the viral and cellular membranes fusion, leading to viral capsid delivery in the cytoplasm of target cells. The conjugation of ATG8/LC3B protein, process referred to as ATG8ylation and mainly studied in the context of autophagy, occurs transiently in the early stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle in CD4&#43; T lymphocytes. Despite numerous studies investigating the interplays of HIV-1 with autophagy machinery, the impact of ATG8ylation in the early stages of HIV-1 infection remains unknown. Here we found that HIV-1 exposure leads to the rapid enrichment of LC3B towards the target cell plasma membrane, in close proximity with the incoming viral particles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATG8ylation is a key event that facilitates HIV-1 fusion with target CD4&#43; T cells. Interestingly, this effect is independent of the canonical autophagy pathway as ATG13 silencing does not prevent HIV-1 entry. Together, our results provide an unconventional role of LC3B conjugation subverted by HIV-1 to achieve a critical early step of its replication cycle.

TeaserHIV-1 induces LC3B enrichment towards its target cell entry site and uses the conjugation of this protein to favor its entry step.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 and influenza both cause enormous disease burdens, and vaccines are the primary measures for their control. Since these viral diseases are transmitted through the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, developing an effective and convenient mucosal vaccine should be a high priority. We previously reported a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based bivalent vaccine (v-EM2/SP{Delta}C1Delta) that protects animals from both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses via intramuscular and intranasal immunization. Here, we further investigated the immune response induced by oral immunization with this vaccine and its protective efficacy in mice. The results demonstrated that the oral cavity delivery, like the intranasal route, elicited strong and protective systemic immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. This included high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, as well as strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and anti-influenza M2 ADCC responses in mice sera. Furthermore, it provided efficient protection against challenge with influenza H1N1 virus in a mouse model, with a 100% survival rate and a significant low lung viral load of influenza virus. All these findings provide substantial evidence for the effectiveness of oral immunization with the rVSV bivalent vaccine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacteroidota are abundant members of the human gut microbiota that shape the enteric landscape by modulating host immunity and degrading dietary- and host-derived glycans. These processes are at least partially mediated by Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). In this work, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify genes required for OMV biogenesis and its regulation in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). Our screening led us to the identification of a novel family of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factors (Dma), which regulate OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employed molecular and multiomic analyses to demonstrate that deletion of Dma1, the founding member of the Dma family, results in hypervesiculation by modulating the expression of NigD1, which belongs to a family of uncharacterized proteins found throughout Bacteroidota. Dma1 has an unprecedented domain organization: it contains a C-terminal {beta}-barrel embedded in the OM; its N-terminal domain interacts with its cognate sigma factor in the cytoplasm, and both domains are tethered via an intrinsically disordered region that traverses the periplasm. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the Dma family is a unique feature of Bacteroidota. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into the regulation of OMV biogenesis in human gut bacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a major public health problem. The main route for AMR acquisition in clinically important bacteria is the horizontal transfer of plasmids carrying resistance genes. AMR plasmids allow bacteria to survive antibiotics, but they also entail physiological alterations in the host cell. Multiple studies over the last years indicate that these alterations can translate into a fitness cost when antibiotics are absent. However, due to technical limitations, most of these studies are based on analysing new associations between plasmids and bacteria generated in vitro, and we know very little about the effects of plasmids in their native bacterial hosts. In this study, we used a CRISPR-Cas9-tool to selectively cure plasmids from clinical enterobacteria to overcome this limitation. Using this approach, we were able to study the fitness effects of the carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in 35 pOXA-48-carrying isolates recovered from hospitalised patients. Our results revealed that pOXA-48 produces variable effects across the collection of wild type enterobacterial strains naturally carrying the plasmid, ranging from fitness costs to fitness benefits. Importantly, the plasmid was only associated with a significant fitness reduction in 4 out of 35 clones, and produced no significant changes in fitness in the great majority of isolates. Our results suggest that plasmids produce neutral fitness effects in most native bacterial hosts, helping to explain the great prevalence of plasmids in natural microbial communities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen but the immune factors that protect against it remain elusive. In particular, high opsonic IgG titers achieved in preclinical S. aureus animal immunization studies have consistently failed to translate to protection in human clinical trials. Here, we investigated the antibody responses to a conserved surface glycan, Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA). IgM and IgG antibodies specific to WTA were universally present in plasma from healthy individuals. Functionally, WTA-specific IgM outperformed IgG in opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus and conferred passive protection against S. aureus infection in vivo. In the clinical setting, WTA-specific IgM responses, but not IgG responses, were significantly lower in S. aureus bacteremia patients compared to healthy individuals, correlated with mortality risk and showed impaired bacterial opsonization. Our findings can guide risk stratification of hospitalized patients and inform future design of antibody-based therapies and vaccines against serious S. aureus infection.</p>
